		<description><![CDATA[I am stunned to read of Seth&#039;s passing, just found out about it this morning when someone left a comment on my book review of the Shangri La Diet. My sincere condolences to all of Seth&#039;s family and friends.

 He was a unique individual and a very caring, giving person, from what I knew. We corresponded by email for a few months when I read, used and wrote about the Shangri La diet, several years ago. This makes me so sad...may he RIP.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi all, I appreciate all the interest in continuing Seth&#039;s work. I want to help where I can. I do need to make a decision what to do with this site and the sethroberts.net forum. I am open to all suggestions what you want to see happen to them. 

Please send your suggestions to twoutopias.amy@gmail.com. If you wish to debate an idea with others, please take it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/101301560863575453174&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Seth Roberts Community&lt;/a&gt; on Google+ or, for non-Google users, start a topic in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://boards.sethroberts.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; under &quot;Self-Experimentation &gt; General.&quot; I&#039;ll be listening. 

@joe An obituary was placed only in one major newspaper, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=seth-roberts&amp;pid=170957308&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

		<description><![CDATA[seth&#039;s family controls the web site; so we&#039;d have to start with them (after an appropriate period of time); then perhaps a like-minded colleague at Berkeley. Alternatively current readers, although it&#039;s not clear if anyone is qualified to sift thru the articles.  Also, there would have to be one person in charge (if everyone is in charge, then no one is charge).]]></description>
