		<description><![CDATA[I had a very severe PPD with my first son, who has very mild autism. I feel that I am lucky to be alive. I noticed that the less I nursed, the less depressed I was. When I finally quit at 11 months, I was back to normal within a month. It was like a miracle. I too had complications and thought that I might die during his delivery. I always assumed the PDD was actually a form of PTSD. I didn&#039;t know anything about omega 3&#039;s 30 years ago, but I have to say, it was the single most awful event of my entire life. I canunderstand now who something like that would have helped. At the time, no one took me seriously, except my mother. She called me every day twice a day and finally, when my son was 3 months old, I went and spent a month with them. I was somewhat better after that. I think my strange labor and delivery were related to oxytocin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post, very interesting. I suffered from terrible insomnia (and PPD/moodiness) since my son&#039;s birth, and once I weaned him at 2.5 years a few months ago, my sleep (and thus, mood) drastically improved. I took fish oil while pregnant (in addition to my prescription, iron-heavy prenatals which I continued taking until weaning) but less vigilantly while breastfeeding. Conventional advice warns mothers of potential depression post-weaning, and bracing myself for that, was shocked to find the complete opposite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent article, thank you Allan. I encouraged my wife to take 2 capsules, daily, of the Nordic Naturals pro-omega/ultra-omega product, which has 650mg EPA / 450mg DHA.  Through two pregnancies (2011 and 2013) and breastfeeding, we had excellent results - calm, alert babies and and no PPD.  It&#039;s impossible to know how much to credit the O3 but your report reinforces my belief that it helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry. What I meant to say...

She’ll have a very hard time knowing how to fix her depression if she is relying on conventional advice, which either completely ignores O3, or at best recommends 1000-1500mg of DHA a week, which is too low an amount to make a difference.

Instead, I believe women should be ready to take 400-800mg of EPA &lt;i&gt;a day&lt;/i&gt;, which works out to 2800-5600mg/week.]]></description>

this isn&#039;t clear. what is the conventional advice?

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your question Thomas. It is a good one.

With our first she took the Rainbow Light pre-natal all through the pregnancy and the whole time she was breastfeeding. It was a hard multivitamin so certainly had no O3. 10 years ago I&#039;m not sure any of them did. Also, &quot;Does your prenatal vitamin have O3?&quot; was certainly a question no one asked us. Nor is it all that far from &quot;Are you taking an O3 vitamin?&quot; which definitely no one asked, much less recommended.

With our third, she took the same pre-natal multivitamin. After three children, I know the routine. They ask, we tell them yes, Rainbow Light, they smile, nod, and say OK, good.

But I&#039;ll respectfully dispute O3 is traditional, or even contemporary, medical advice. DHA is &quot;a thing&quot; now, but is it ever linked to mental health of the mother? Please show me where. I only see it marketed as important for the baby&#039;s development, akin to Folic Acid and Vitamin D. If the baby is healthy, who is going to know to take O3 for mom&#039;s benefit?

Finally, the One-a-Day of 200mg of DHA and 23mg/day of EPA is very questionably adequate. From the Bloch/Qawasmi paper that Seth linked to on Monday we know EPA has greater efficacy than DHA. It&#039;s why O3 was discredited for ADHD treatment early on -- all the early studies used DHA and the effects were mixed at best. For my wife, 400/200mg of EPA/DHA respectively, ie. 1 capsule a week, was not enough to keep her mood level, and twice that amount was the bare minimum. OaD is ~1500/wk. If the woman is lucky enough to have the DHA work for her, she might be fine, but if not I think she&#039;ll have a very hard time knowing how to fix it if she is relying on conventional advice (switch to EPA and 2-5X the dosage) . My fear is doubling up on her OaD, a reasonable thing to attempt, is unlikely to help. So she&#039;ll give up on O3 for the wrong reasons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, crickets. :) Let me guess tl;dr? Sorry.

As for the Atlantic article (and I thought I mine was long), not impressed. Didn&#039;t make a clear enough distinction between &quot;blues&quot; and depression. Beyond that, sure, Dads are sleep-deprived too and experience negative effects. No surprise there. However, it didn&#039;t offer any prescriptive advice beyond the usual &quot;communicate, get rest, eat well, brush your teeth well and floss.&quot; Ok, maybe not that last one, but I didn&#039;t read the whole thing so maybe it&#039;s in there after all. :)]]></description>
