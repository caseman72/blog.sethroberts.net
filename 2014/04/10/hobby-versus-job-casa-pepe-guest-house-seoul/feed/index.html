		<description><![CDATA[Beer making is a very interesting example. I suppose there is a set of products where we tend to think that small scale production = better: beer, cheese, wine, sausage (?), book-binding (?), others. The word artisanal is used. In other cases, we think bigger = better: flat-screen TV, car, and so on.]]></description>
