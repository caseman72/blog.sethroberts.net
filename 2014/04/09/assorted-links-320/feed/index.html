		<description><![CDATA[At the end of the Honey health benefit article there is a link to •10 uses for honey outside the kitchen.
&quot;#9: Fight insomnia: If you don&#039;t have much trouble falling asleep, but tend to wake up in the middle of the night, it could be totally natural (for centuries many people had a two-sleep schedule) or it could be due to stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol, being out of tune. A bit of salted honey (you need both sweet and salty) can help reset these hormones and get you back to sleep. You only need a small amount (this shouldn&#039;t be a snack!), so use a teaspoon or egg spoon to keep yourself from overindulging.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nancy, it has to do with cooking the potatoes. When you cook potatoes to a certain temperature (I think it&#039;s about 140 F) the starch granules burst and become regular starch which your body digests as such.  Cooked and cooled potatoes, green bananas and other food that contain undigestible resistant starch which then feed the gut bugs in your lower digestive tract.  Lots of info at Mark&#039;s Daily Apple which ran the self-experiment post (which I thought had a nice outline of how do do your own self-experimentation).  Also there is a lot of info at Free the Animal blog.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nancy, potatoes that are cooked and cooled will contain a small amount of resistant starch, but not much. If you are shooting for a certain intake target, it is much easier to take pure resistant starch in the form of potato starch than to get it from whole foods.]]></description>
