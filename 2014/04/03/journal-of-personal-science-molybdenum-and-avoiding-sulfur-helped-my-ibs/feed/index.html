		<description><![CDATA[Louis,

The two week period included both molybdenum and the low sulfite diet. 

I can say I had problems sleeping at various times, but I had not associated it with I.B.S. because of stress in my life. I did not track my sleep during the two weeks and I can&#039;t remember if it improved specifically during those two weeks.
I have my windows covered and I try to avoid blue light at night, but I notice sleep changes depending on the season, stress, and I assume the more pain I am in, the more likely I will stay awake too, so I.B.S. must have had some effect.

I can say I am sleeping reasonably well now.  I wake up before my alarm, possibly in anticipation of the loud birds who inhabit my neighborhood.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi August
Thank you for taking the time to write down this post. It was really interesting, and I will try this out over the coming weeks. I will start today and take away MSM and instead put in some molyben.

The last entry from Louis was really interesting and I am very intressted in your comments on that, because that is a big thing even for me.

2. I have a number of symptoms that I think are related to the IBS such as insomnia and difficulty concentrating. Did you too have symptoms related to your IBS? If so, did they go away or show improvement in two weeks too?

Kindly
Anne]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello, August,

Thanks for writing this article.  I imagine you might be helping many people; perhaps you&#039;ve helped me at least.  If nothing else, it&#039;s another hypothesis for me to test.

I believe I could have this issue with sulfites, so I&#039;ve begun a low sulfur diet.  I too have IBS that got slightly better on a low FODMAP diet, but by no means took care of it completely.

I&#039;m wondering a couple things:

1. You say that you had normal BM&#039;s after two weeks.  Did that two week period include supplementing with molybdenum or was that on the low sulfite diet alone?
2. I have a number of symptoms that I think are related to the IBS such as insomnia and difficulty concentrating.  Did you too have symptoms related to your IBS?  If so, did they go away or show improvement in two weeks too?

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I started supplementing with molybdenum after I did a hair minerals analysis test which showed very low levels of molybdenum.  I felt better.  23andme said that I was a slow metabolizer of caffeine.  Molybdenum is used in caffeine detoxification via xanthine oxidase.  Supplementation helped reduce caffeine withdrawal symptoms the next day.  
The farmer who I buy almost all of my beef from commented that my hair test was similar to his soil minerals test.  A different local farmer commented that her soil minerals test showed a deficiency in molybdenum.  When I go to the farmer&#039;s market, I find that asking farmers if they do soil mineral tests and supplementation is a good indicator of whether their food will taste good.  The best farmers test beyond ph, Ca, Mg, N, P, K to a plethora of micronutrients Mo, Se, Fe, Cu, Zn, B, Mn, Cr, Co, etc.  Soil mineral deficiencies become mineral deficiencies in the plants and animals grown on that soil.  People can&#039;t go to nutritiondata.com, plug in their daily diet, and assume that their diet contains all the necessary minerals because the website says it should.  
One of William Albrecht&#039;s themes was that the soil quality in the South is compromised due to heat and precipitation leaching out the minerals from the soil.  Maybe it is coincidence that the author is from the South.  I don&#039;t know.

Other minerals which were low on the test like lithium (5 mg/day) and magnesium (via MgCl foot baths), I also noticed a benefit from supplementing.  But I haven&#039;t noticed a benefit from supplementing selenium.]]></description>
