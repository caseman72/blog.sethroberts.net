		<description><![CDATA[I think Ioannidis serves the important role of deconstructing the temple. I don&#039;t think he is trying to say that too many papers are wrong, rather he is saying that we underestimate how many are wrong, and this leads to counterproductive practice.

He is not trying to point out the solution, he is only pointing out the errors. There&#039;s nothing wrong with that. Ioannidis is the garbageman of medical science.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, my apologies if you are already aware of this connection, but you should know that the way that you talk about idea-generation in science is *extremely* similar to the way people in the &quot;lean startup&quot; movement talk about starting businesses.

The core idea of leans startup is that instead of investing the time and money to start a business based on a hunch of whether there is demand for its product, you should progress through a sequence of progressively more expensive stages of data gathering to validate your idea. So first do the cheapest possible thing that you can do to test an idea, such as basic analysis and discussions. Then do the next most expensive thing you can do to test it further (such as customer surveys, or trial ad campaigns). Proceed along this path, ramping up your investment gradually, in a way shaped by evidence you are discovering. People in the lean world like to talk about &quot;de-risking&quot; the process, by proceeding in this incremental and empirical way.

This is just like the progression you describe, from cheap idea generation, to cheap tests via self-experimentation, to more expensive research trials.

I mention not only because it&#039;s interesting, but because the lean startup movement is large and quite influential in certain circles. It might help you to spread your ideas in some quarters, if you pointed out this parallel.

I think this is one of the main books used to describe this approach: http://theleanstartup.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Al, that same claim can be made for just about any cross-sectional study, unless they control for those factors. And that&#039;s almost impossible to do. 

And the opposing disclaimer could be that vegetarians are usually MORE health conscious (have healthier habits) than your average bear. 

Here&#039;s another study that comes to roughly the same conclusion:

http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/04/06/jnci.djq072.abstract

So the next time you hear someone say how healthy a vegetarian lifestyle is, think back to these studies. A vegetarian diet will usually lower your LDL and TC, but it will also substantially raise your trigs and lower your HDL level (the so-called &quot;good&quot; cholesterol). The latter two are supposedly risk factors for heart disease. So you&#039;re damned if you do, and damned if you don&#039;t.

Which is why the diet-heart theory of heart disease is absurd, in my opinion. And is making some of us do really stupid things, like take statin drugs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a vegetarian, but I took a look at that study from plosone.org, and I found the following statement near the end: 

&quot;Potential limitations of our results are due to the fact that the
survey was based on cross-sectional data. Therefore, no statements
can be made whether the poorer health in vegetarians in our study
is caused by their dietary habit or if they consume this form of diet
due to their poorer health status. We cannot state whether a causal
relationship exists, but describe ascertained associations. Moreover,
we cannot give any information regarding the long-term
consequences of consuming a special diet nor concerning mortality
rates.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Game...Set...Match?

&quot;Vegetarians were twice as likely to have atopy (allergies), a 50 percent increase in cancer and a 50 percent increase in heart attacks.&quot;

http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0088278&amp;representation=PDF

I watched FOX News this morning, and they were heralding a new study where it was discovered that 1 out of 3 American children, between the ages of 9-11, had &quot;high&quot; cholesterol levels, and that &quot;something must be done about this!&quot;

[No mention of Hippocrates&#039; warning to: &quot;First, do no harm.&quot;]

What do you suppose that certain &quot;something&quot; will inevitably be?  

It doesn&#039;t take Nate Silver to forecast the probable answer: more statins!  Maybe mix them right into the kids&#039; boxes of CoCo Puffs and fruit juice?

Or the next &quot;big thing,&quot; PCSK9 inhibitors (currently in Phase III clinical trials), which lower cholesterol levels even MORE than statins.

All that, while study after study shows that people with &quot;high&quot; cholesterol levels live longer than those with &quot;low&quot; levels!

http://www.ravnskov.nu/the%20benefits%20of%20high%20C.htm

How do we stop this runaway train before it takes most of us right over the cliff with it? I have no idea. :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We did an accidental experiment this week.  We made lots of apple sauce for the roast pork on Sunday, but that left me with no apple to chop up for breakfast the next day.  So I took some of the surplus sauce and stirred it up with half  a banana and and a couple of tablespoons of Greek yoghurt to mimic my usual meal.  I felt so full all morning that I could scarcely eat lunch at my usual time.  I reckon the secret was that when the apple sauce was made it had been reinforced with some of the pork fat.

I suppose it&#039;s ancient knowledge that a bit of fat at breakfast saves you from the desire for a mid-morning munch, but I was  struck by how firm the lesson was here.  It seemed to be clearer than I&#039;ve ever had it from nuts at breakfast, for instance.]]></description>
