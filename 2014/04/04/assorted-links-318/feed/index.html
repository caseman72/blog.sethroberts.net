		<description><![CDATA[Researchers Debunk Bubonic Plague of Black Death In Europe, Classify it As a Pneumonic Plague Instead

Growing up, children have been taught that the Black Death, which spread throughout London in the mid-1300s and killed roughly 60 percent of the population, was caused by fleas off the backs of rats traveling on boats from Asia.

However, researchers believe the disease, previously thought to be bubonic and spread through fleabites from human to human, was actually an airborne virus given its fast-spreading nature, according to the Washington Post. Such a pattern of transmission would make the black death a pneumonic plague, not a bubonic one.
