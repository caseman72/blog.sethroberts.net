		<description><![CDATA[I would like to share my experience about honey. I brush my teeth using honey and it kills harmful bacteria in mouth because I know it is antibacterial effect. When I burn my skin, I apply honey after cold applying. It recovers the skin speedily, but you should cover of it. Same for scars and cuts. And now it is interesting to hear honey helps for losing weight and good sleep. I think it is a miracle food for people. Why I started to use honey: I read some verses from the Qur&#039;an and it triggered me to search honey. Related verses says: &quot;And your Lord inspired to the bee, &quot;Take for yourself among the mountains, houses, and among the trees and [in] that which they construct. Then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your Lord laid down [for you].&quot; There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought.&quot; Nahl 68-69 verses]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The one invariable effect I find from 1 Tbsp of honey before bed: no matter how little sleep, I get up in the morning without intolerable fatigue. 

Recently I varied other beneficial sleep factors - reduced the carbs, no relora - and achieved the grand total of 12 hours sleep over 3 days. Previously that would have had a dreadful effect on me, but I was waking fairly easily and able to perform well on each day. Amazing - although I did have to catch up on sleep late in the week. 

I have now restored my previous routine, but this honey effect seems constant over the past few months.

Eradication of that fatigue is helpful with anxiety over sleep onset.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FWIW, I&#039;ve experimented with other sources of sugar besides honey and bananas and found a similar effect.  I&#039;ve been following Seth&#039;s schedule of taking a dose right before bed, an hour or so before and about two hours before bed.  I&#039;ve slept better when I&#039;ve taken the equivalent of two TBS of honey 2 hours before bed and one TBS the next two times.  I also find my sleep is improved if I&#039;ve had some sugar around mid-afternoon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To determine an unusual score I look at the data. I don&#039;t do any calculations.

The time of day seems to have a small effect. I don&#039;t know what you mean by &quot;consistency of timing&quot; but if you mean the time between tests that appears to matter little. For example, if I stop for 3 days after doing the test daily it will not change the score by much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve started to collect reaction-time data. Is your bar for an unusual score a certain number of standard deviations out? Have you determined how important the time of day of the test and consistency of timing is? I&#039;ve been testing every hour for a week and so far it is not at all clear.]]></description>
