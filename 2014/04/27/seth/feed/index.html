		<description><![CDATA[Seth!
I just learned tonight why you failed to show up on the 26th of April as we had planned.  I didn&#039;t want to bug you so I didn&#039;t call or email to ask what happened.  Now I know.  I finally sent an email tonight asking if you were alright--&#039;cause it wasn&#039;t like you to disappear.  I am in shock to know that my worse fears are true.

Seth came to see me after the publication of The Chair in 1998.  No other colleague sought me out on the basis of ideas.  Turns out we were both Reedies, and I proposed that we teach a course together, &quot;The office of the future&quot; (which we thought of as neolithic).  We did, twice, once with others from the business school, &quot;The Post-Dilbert Office.&quot; We were both interested in nutrition and food and ate together in NYC and the Bay area intermittently.  We had dinner at the new restaurant that replaced O Chame on April 24.  He offered to help me with some computer issues on the afternoon of the 26th.  

Seth, my friend, this is your friend Galen, saying farewell--and re-opening to the depth of appreciation I have for you.  You&#039;d love the book I&#039;m reading now.  Dang, I wish we could talk about it after you read it.
Love,
Galen]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is truly heart-breaking news. Such a loss.

Two things always amazed me about Seth. 

First, that he was such an original thinker -- really, truly, genuinely original, in a deep and intelligent way. 

Second, that he managed to remain so optimistic and so cheerful! He did this despite facing the incomprehension and neglect which comes from being so  original. I am sure he could have made his life much easier, professionally, by doing work that was more conventional. But he did not.

In this way, he has been a model to me both intellectually and emotionally, a model I do not expect to live up to.

I was working on a project that I was very keen to share with him (an app inspired by his blog posts on Magic Dots), and it&#039;s hard to believe now I will never have the chance to show him.

I am sure his passing is a great loss not only for us but for the many people who do not know him at all, but certainly would have benefited from his curiosity and his courage.]]></description>

I hope you are having some comfort in the number of lives your brother has touched, and that you feel joy in the number of people he has changed and incluenced.  I continue to miss Seth, and hold you all in my thoughts.  I wish you peace.]]></description>

I hope this is not some side effect from the self-experimentation - I remember some study stating that too high Omega-3-dosage could lead to epileptic seizures (but never found that study again).

Most important: My condolesence to you, Amy, and the rest of Seths family and friends! Seth will be missed!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve followed Seth&#039;s blog for years and always admired his critical thinking, curiosity and lack of complacency to blindly accept conventional wisdom. It&#039;s so hard to believe he is gone.  

I guess part of me wishes that he really hasn&#039;t died, that this was another QS &quot;experiment&quot; of Seth&#039;s ... to see how many web hits could be generated quoting from a single 50-word post (&quot;Hello, this is Seth’s sister, Amy, with the sad news...&quot;) without any other corroborating sources such as published obituaries, mortuary listings, a Berkley press release, a hospital reference or news articles from even a small or local newspaper, an alumni newsletter, other public family statements  ... anything. But I&#039;ll keep watching and keep google-ing, hoping it&#039;s just a bad dream.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was stunned when I opened the blog a few days ago and saw the news.  I didn&#039;t know or correspond with Seth but I read his original paper that eventually became the SLD book and followed his blog whenever possible.  He was brilliant and so good at puncturing inflated claims made by the medical establishment.  I always wanted to tell him that most of the things he did for himself did not work for me at all but he taught me how to find the things that do.

The world needs a lot more people like Seth.  My deepest condolences to the family and friends.  And please let us know what happened.]]></description>
