			<p>My condolences. I&#8217;m stunned; I&#8217;ve been reading his blog for awhile and never suspected his health was failing.</p>
<p>I know this is a rough time, but I&#8217;d like to ask: if you don&#8217;t already know for certain, please preserve any evidence, digital and physical, that might indicate why he died. If it was the result of one of his self-experiments, then I think he would want us to know.</p>

			<p>I am so sorry to hear this.  I followed his work closely both here and in my academic career (Roberts and Pashler, 2000 should be required reading for all scientists).  His passion for the science and understanding the world around us shone through in everything I read of his.  I&#8217;ll miss him.</p>

			<p>I am deeply sadden to learn of his death.</p>
<p>Amy, I would like to know if he died of a brain hemorrhage (or other sort of hemorrhage) and what his level of omega 3 intake was.  Please fill us in on the medical details.</p>
<p>In October, I emailed him this: &#8220;I left a comment because you underestimated your omega 3 consumption by a factor of 10.  The denominator is 10 g for flaxseeds, not 100 g. </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/18/omega-3-and-omega-6-in-common-foods-and-my-consumption/#comment-1152121" rel="nofollow">http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/18/omega-3-and-omega-6-in-common-foods-and-my-consumption/#comment-1152121</a>  &#8221;</p>
<p>[That is, his omega 3 intake was about 13 grams/day]</p>
<p>And he responded with the next day with  &#8220;thank you for your comment (and the additional info in your email), I took your comment VERY seriously. I have already gone down from 60 g/day to 30 g/day. </p>
<p>But it is not so obvious what to do because if I remember correctly I found that 60 g/day produced better results than 30 g/day. I&#8217;m not sure about that however. Maybe I am misremembering. Maybe I will stay at 30 g/day for a while and then see if there is any difference when I go to 15 g/day.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m absolutely shocked that this happened to Seth. I&#8217;ve never met him, just interacted via a few comments on his blog and an email conversation, but I feel like I just lost someone I know. Seth had such a curious, bright mind and was never afraid to challenge the status quo. A great loss&#8230;</p>

			<p>I am shocked. I am in shock. I can&#8217;t bring myself to believe Seth is gone, and feel like this is some elaborate hoax. Seth has been a dear friend for a long time. My collaboration with him, and my conversations with him, have made a profound impact on my life. His warm companionship, unique intellect, insatiable curiosity, and infinite creativity will be missed. A bit of Seth will live on in me for the rest of my life.</p>

			<p>EVERYTHING that Nancy said, which was perfect. Seth was curious, persistent, and an asset to the human community.</p>
<p>I met him once at the Ancestral Health Symposium and he was just as I&#8217;d imagined: quiet, shy, curious, and studious. A complete person, at one with his path, it seemed. May his work live on.</p>

			<p>Amy, I am so very sad to hear about your loss.  Seth was such a bright light, a unique voice for personal science and also just a lovely person. </p>
<p>I emailed him &#8216;out of the blue&#8217; one day, never expecting a reply, with a request that I never thought he&#8217;d be interested in (to publicise my health issue on his blog, so that anyone with info could contact me). </p>
<p>Not only did I get an answer almost immediately, but he was enthusiastic about my idea, did it that day, and asked me to keep him updated on my progress. And when I did, he always replied with encouragement and ideas. People just aren&#8217;t like that, especially busy, quite famous professors.</p>

			<p>Amy, my deepest sympathies to you and your family.  I never met Seth in person, but we corresponded for several years, and I spoke with him over Skype a few times.  Recently, we started the &#8220;Brain Tracking&#8221; group for people who were interested in self-experimentation.  Seth was a unique individual, and I&#8217;m greatly saddened by his death.  The loss is profound.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m co-moderator of the Google+ Group for people who are interested in tracking their reaction time.  Although Seth was the main driving force behind the project, I do think that we should continue his work.  If anyone is interested in joining the group, you can do so here (you have to have a Google+ account before you can request membership in the group):</p>

			<p>My life has improved greatly from rigorous application of his insights. I now share them with others as food for thought. His work will forever impact the future.</p>
<p>Of all the things he suggested and that I tried &#8212; morning faces, nighttime honey/dessert, increased butter consumption, Vitamin D in the morning, introducing fermented foods into my diet, flaxseed for better gum health &#8212; I have benefited from, and experimented with. Sometimes it was less the case that the suggestion solved a problem and more the case that it opened my mind to the possibilities of tinkering with and understanding my body more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also valued the insights on teaching posted to this blog.</p>

			<p>I discovered Seth&#8217;s Shangri-La diet through Aaron Swartz, and unlike so many other things, it made me feel as if I had some control over my weight.</p>
<p>His approach to self-experimentation inspired me to start thinking about my life in a similar way. And in fact, I have been working on a percentile feedback tool (with the help of Nick Winter) that helps me make better use of my time. This was directly copied from one of his experiments.</p>
<p>Seth has had a profound effect on my life, and I am shocked and saddened to learn of his passing. Thank you for everything, Seth.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve lost a great mind but the people he inspired will continue to self-experiment and step-by-step improve the world.</p>

			<p>My deepest condolences to you and your family, Amy. Seth made a lasting impact with his initial research discoveries about timing and animals. This work has been, and will continue to be, textbook material that generations of professors will teach and generations of students will learn. He continued to make an impact in his more recent work with self-experimentation, as can be seen by the number of posts before this one. His critical thinking and spirit of inquisitiveness and discovery will be missed by all.</p>

			<p>Really stunned and sad to see this news.  <img src='http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />   Deepest sympathies to Seth&#8217;s family and friends.  His passing is such a loss, for all of the reasons mentioned above.  I hope we can celebrate and continue his spirit of profound inquiry.</p>
<p>It feels especially startling given the care Seth obviously gave to his own health (though perhaps this extra attention grew out of a condition we, or he, didn&#8217;t know about.)</p>
<p>Someone mentioned his dosage of ground flaxseed.  By my calculations, it would take 22 (large, Nordic Naturals pro-omega) fish oil capsules to match the 13g of flax-derived Omega 3s he took daily.  That&#8217;s a lot.  Unrelated to Seth&#8217;s experiment, I took around the same amount of 4 tbs ground flaxseed for a few weeks but developed spontaneous bleeding in my eye and stopped. (until seeing these calculations today, I had no idea 4 tbs had that much omega 3)</p>
<p>Checking this blog had become a treasured nightly ritual for me. Seth&#8217;s wisdom will be greatly missed.</p>

			<p>I am so sorry for this loss. Seth was quite unique in his empirical approach to medical problems and blog posts (which I&#8217;ve followed for years now) will greatly be missed.</p>
<p>I believe it is unfortunate that his untimely passing might now cast doubt on the efficacy of particular regimens he followed. To those who might think this, remember that there could be other causal factors we did not know regarding his health that could have encouraged him to become active in this field.</p>
<p>Amy, again I&#8217;m so sorry for you loss. If you ever do decide to release more information about causes that lead to his passing, please let us know. I believe it&#8217;s an extremely personal topic, but also feel that such information is something that Seth believed could help to advance both the medical field and humanity, in general.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,<br />

			<p>I agree with a previous poster that to truly honor Seth&#8217;s work we should ask for a detailed understanding of how and why he died as soon as it&#8217;s appropriate. I think it&#8217;s safe to say that is what he would have wanted.</p>
<p>Many of us have followed his prescriptions, and is it possible that some of his ideas led to short term benefits but long term consequences? Or did he suffer from some condition, and his experimentation led him to live longer than he otherwise would have? Perhaps we&#8217;ll never know. But it&#8217;s worth asking questions when the time is right.</p>

<p>I will greatly miss Seth&#8217;s unique perspective on the many diverse topics that were of interest to him and his readers.  He, and the commenters on his posts, challenged my thinking, in the best possible ways, on my notions of health, personal responsibility, fairness, convention and conviction.</p>
<p>Most of my days included a visit to Seth&#8217;s Blog and I am a better educated person for the time I spent considering his ideas, reasoning and criticisms.

			<p>Amy, you might be the wrong person to do this, but you or someone Seth would have trusted should try to take some of his blog posts and papers and turn them into a book. Seth was a thinker, and for such people a book is the ultimate testament to their lives.</p>

			<p>Seth Roberts.</p>
<p>A man I often had a question for and was always honored and surprised that he had questions for me. A truly insatiably curious man, the very definition of a man in my eyes.</p>
<p>When I did my AHS11 presentation, he was the first person to the microphone for the Q&amp;A. Every now and then, I&#8217;d get an email asking if and when I was going to blog about some thing or the other that I had said (and forgotten) I would blog about.</p>
<p>He probably had 3&#215;5 cards or something to keep track. <img src='http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>My deepest condolences to you and your family. I am one of the many who did not know Seth personally but avidly followed his blog and occasionally entered the fray of the comments section. There are a zillion blogs out there, but Seth&#8217;s so enriched my life that, from the time I discovered it, I made it a daily ritual to check in&#8211; and was almost always astonished by whatever he had posted, and astonished at his continuing generosity. Seth&#8217;s creativity, courage, generosity, and quest for excellence were truly an inspiration to me&#8211;and so many others. His passing is a great loss.</p>

			<p>Dear Amy,<br />
I cannot imagine what your family is going through right now. I am one of the many people (all of us strangers) who tried to help Seth. I called 911, and was on the phone with them until the medics and fire came. I am available to you and your family with a very open heart and with great sadness for your loss. Please contact me if you would like to. I am so very sorry. I have been thinking about your family, hoping to let you know that I am available if I can help with anything around closure, but not knowing how to contact anyone, since Saturday.<br />
In humanity,<br />

			<p>I am shocked and horrified.  Seth Roberts was responsible for 20 pounds of personal weight-loss for me via Shangri-La, and when I reported that the diet mysteriously stopped working after that, he personally Skyped and emailed with me on suggestions trying to get it working again.  His personal spirit of investigation was an inspiration to all of us and is probably to some extent responsible for my trying to compose my own ketogenic Soylent now.  I&#8217;m sad.</p>

<p>I feel it as a personal loss as well. I only recently learned of this site.

His blog led me to Nikoley&#8217;s and to Dr Sarno (Healing Back Pain) and a complete cure of 20 years of back pain. Free. No drugs no surgery &#8212; just thinking. Truly life changing.</p>
<p>We became friends here in Beijing, where I teach at the university just down the road from his Tsinghua. Amy, if there is anything that needs to be done in Beijing I am happy to do it (steve.hansen@gmail.com). My condolences.<br />

You were a great thinker and blogger. I read your blog everyday, for insight, outrage and sometimes a laugh. Thank for helping us all look past conventional wisdom, question all the bad answers out there and actually supply some good ones of your own. You helped me certainly and I know many others. Thanks for the quick responses to emails. I found myself thinking &#8220;Seth would like this&#8221; when I found a gem on the internet.  I&#8217;ll still think that.<br />

			<p>Amy &#8211; Like man others, I am stunned and shocked by this news.  I&#8217;ve known Seth since we met back in 1978 &#8211; when he first joined the UC Berkeley Psychology Department as a young assistant professor and I was a second-year grad student.  I think Seth introduced me to you during that early period.  We had a long, fascinating friendship that lasted right up to last Thursday, when we were trading emails about the OPTIMA breast cancer trial I&#8217;d just joined.  I will always remember him for his refreshing, honest outlook on scientific research and his love of experimentation &#8211; including wild and wacky projects with food and exercise &#8211; as long as I live.  He will be deeply missed by me and no doubt man others.</p>

			<p>My condolences to the family. I discovered Seth&#8217;s blog and writings early this year. I loved his theories and his experimental approach. It&#8217;s sad that such a brilliant scientist and self-experimenter is gone. This kind of tragic loss really forces you to put things into perspective. We still have a lot to learn and we need to approach the quest for the ultimate health truth-if such thing exists–with humility, positivity and patience. For, even the best of us aren&#8217;t infallible.<br />
Seth, thank you for your work and experiments, for making it available to others and for improving the lives of many. You will be missed. May you rest in peace.</p>

			<p>What a terrible, horrible loss! </p>
<p>I had just emailed with Seth on Friday night putting the finishing pieces on a piece I was writing on how self experimentation had improved me in sleep. </p>
<p>Not only had Seth&#8217;s ideas been the original impetus for my sleep improvement, but he had also mentored me in the design and data analysis in R of my self experimentation, and also been a fabulous corespondent and entertaining writer. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll miss Seth in all these ways:</p>
<p>- As a generator of novel ideas<br />
- As perhaps the most rigorous thinker in QS around design &amp; data analysis<br />
- As an entertaining blogger<br />
- As a friendly, approachable corespondent</p>
<p>What a gigantic loss. Thanks, Seth, for all you did.</p>

			<p>Hi All,<br />
I am so stunned and saddened by Seth Roberts&#8217; death. We&#8217;d been friends since 1997 and had many fascinating conversations. He helped me in so many ways. </p>
<p>Specifically, his Pavlovian analysis of weight control and his crucial insight that consuming calories with little or no flavor would reduce hunger, enabled me to lose, on average, about 20% of my weight and keep it off over the past 15 years. Shortly after I first met him I described my problems with over-eating and pigging out on sweets and fats. He stunned me when he said, &#8220;Interesting that no one ever pigs out on fruits and vegetables.&#8221; Interesting indeed!</p>
<p>And his insistence that if I stopped being a night person and went to bed earlier, and tried to get morning sunlight, my baseline mood would improve, turned out to be true, and did far more than anything else to help me come out of depression. </p>
<p>I learned so much from Seth &#8212; about how to think and how to listen. He was the most intellectually fearless and tenacious person that I&#8217;ve known. He used his brilliance to attack very core problems that caused a great deal of human suffering &#8212; obesity, sleep problems, depression &#8212; and came up with concrete solutions that truly helped people. His blog was also a site through which many interesting ideas were funneled. He delighted in being able to help people. He was scientific in the best sense &#8212; science is simply a method of being rigorously and flexibly sensible and intelligent and open; it was a joy to watch Seth become intellectually excited and pounce upon an idea, a finding, a realization. He became possessed and fascinated at such times. He was unafraid to ask questions or appear dumb. </p>
<p>He had such a freshness of mind that at times he appeared to start all over from scratch in approaching a problem and re-think it. I once told him of research about how to improve one&#8217;s memory; he said that he did not want a better memory. His ability to forget and see things freshly was part of his creativity.</p>
<p>I knew him mostly in Berkeley, but more recently in China where we both taught at Tsinghua. In November of last year, I had dinner with Seth and three of his Tsinghua students &#8212; it was apparent how much they liked and admired him, and how much he appreciated them. One student said to me, &#8220;His students love him.&#8221; He frequently spoke and blogged about the brilliance and decency of his students at Tsinghua.</p>
<p>Ten days before his death we had dinner in Berkeley. He said he wanted to write 8 hours a day until September when he returned to China; he was excited about starting a column on personal science for the New York Observer. The world is worse off without him in so many ways.</p>
<p>He had a sweetness that was both personal and intellectual. He had so much more to give to the world, so much more to teach us &#8212; it is so sad that we will be deprived of Seth. He was a truly original thinker; such people are rare.</p>
<p>A certain original sweetness and a certain original brilliance has left us.</p>
<p>My condolences go out to everyone who knew him.<br />

			<p>After a long time following his blog, I met Seth once, last fall at Nefeli Cafe on UC Berkeley&#8217;s Northside.  We discussed ideas for personalizing courses at Berkeley so that students would learn better.</p>
<p>Seth was one of those very rare men who genuinely personified the cliche &#8220;thinking outside of the box&#8221; instead of mouthing the words.  It was brilliant of him to look past his field&#8217;s staid view of the scientific method to the little-explored question of how to generate hypotheses worth testing.  His arguments for why self-experimentation can accomplish some things that large controlled intervention studies cannot accomplish are dead-on.  And I have to admire his powers of observation, both in spotting interventions that seem utterly unlikely (in weight loss, depression, mental performance, etc.), and in finding ways to motivate the students in his courses to give unique performances.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m as stunned as anyone that he died so young.  Is there anyone else who thinks like he did?</p>

			<p>My condolences to Seth&#8217;s family.  As is evident by responses here and across the Internet, Seth impacted many people&#8217;s lives in profound ways.  </p>
<p>While not the only way, Seth did an interview once with a blogger about Uggs.  That interview got me thinking about creating a blog about minimalist footwear &#8212; FiveFingers, specifically &#8212; as I was looking for other blogging outlets outside my of my (considerably less focused!) personal site.  The result was BirthdayShoes.com, which has reached a few million eyeballs over the last five years and changed my life in many, many ways.  Oh how the ripples grow!</p>
<p>Seth once asked me why I blogged and while the reasons are many, his death makes one extremely poignant: your life scales to touching the lives of others in ways you can barely realize.  Thank you, Seth, for changing my life in so many ways.</p>

			<p>My condolences to Seth&#8217;s family. I know him in 2010 when he gave a talk at Tsinghua about his self-experiments of changing diets. I was an undergraduate there and very intrigued by his thesis. After that I came to talk to him about my acnes and I thought maybe I could try to identify the reasons for it by adopting his methods. Then we started a spreadsheet to track my diet, sleeping time and other potential factors. I remember it was not easy to get omega 3 oil in Beijing and sometimes he got some for me. I guess there were so many other factors than diet playing role in this experiment and I moved to Shenzhen later in 2010, so we never went deep into the data and analysis. I was a journalism major in undergrad but used quant models to do my thesis. He was surprised at first but then he wrote long emails listing why journalists should learn statistics. Working with him definitely changed my way of thinking and his intellectual curiosity is always an inspiration. I just wish I could have spent more time chatting with him and know him better. RIP Seth.</p>

Seth&#8217;s unique intellect found insights which improved many lives and will doubtless help still more people as others learn of his work. That he won&#8217;t be continuing this work is a loss to all.</p>
<p>On a personal level, Seth generously spoke and corresponded with me on several occasions which I greatly appreciated. I had always thought I would have another chance to get his thoughts on his work, or have a chance to meet in person. I hope his blog will continue as a legacy and tribute.</p>

			<p>How tragic. What more is there to say? Seth was a rare independent thinker and I have every confidence that many of his hypotheses will be decisively confirmed in the long run. In the meanwhile, his legacy lives on in all those he inspired. RIP.</p>

<p>I sat in on his Psych 1 class when I was 17 and followed his career since then, including interviewing him for a paper. </p>

			<p>Seth and I became interested in each other&#8217;s research about thirty-five<br />
years ago, when he was a graduate student at Brown.  In the years<br />
since then we were collaborators and friends.  (Each of us has<br />
attested to how much we learned from the other.)  I followed his<br />
work in detail, and as you&#8217;ll see from my comments elsewhere<br />
(<a href="http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~saul/about.seth.roberts.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~saul/about.seth.roberts.pdf</a>)<br />
his scientific accomplishments, I admired them greatly.  Except for<br />
occasional visits, our interchanges were long-distance ones, phone<br />
or email.  We discussed many topics &#8212; from how to make thicker<br />
yogurt to the fairest procedure in considering a tenured professor<br />
for dismissal.  And of course, various aspects of science.</p>
<p>My interactions with Seth contributed greatly to the enjoyment of<br />
my scientific life.  I am deeply grateful for all that he gave me.<br />
Hearing about his untimely death, another friend said: &#8220;What a<br />
tragedy.  I am so sorry to hear that.  I know he was a dear friend<br />
of yours and a kind of intellectual child.  And such a brilliant<br />
and brave intellect. This must leave a hole in your world.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Indeed, it does.</p>

			<p>Dear Amy,</p>
<p>I am so sorry to hear about Seth&#8217;s passing. I send healing wishes to you and family. You probably remember me from Tam, where I first met Seth &#8211; the brightest kid in a group of very bright classmates. He and I connected from time to time over the years, although not enough and not recently. I was always intrigued by his research and I will follow up via the links on this blog.</p>
<p>At this sad time, the outpouring of sympathy and support from so many people who benefited from knowing Seth and his work is a wonderful tribute.</p>

			<p>I followed Seth&#8217;s blog religiously for the past several years. It was among the first things I read everyday. I learnt a lot from his thoughts on general science and personal science, on how to learn, and even on how to sleep soundly on airplanes! He was someone who never let anything get in the way of his pursuit of the verifiable truth. He was indeed a searchlight of a man, who illuminated many things with simple experiments backed by profound questions! May he rest in peace. I will greatly miss him.</p>

			<p>I was stunned when I opened the blog a few days ago and saw the news.  I didn&#8217;t know or correspond with Seth but I read his original paper that eventually became the SLD book and followed his blog whenever possible.  He was brilliant and so good at puncturing inflated claims made by the medical establishment.  I always wanted to tell him that most of the things he did for himself did not work for me at all but he taught me how to find the things that do.</p>
<p>The world needs a lot more people like Seth.  My deepest condolences to the family and friends.  And please let us know what happened.</p>

<p>I guess part of me wishes that he really hasn&#8217;t died, that this was another QS &#8220;experiment&#8221; of Seth&#8217;s &#8230; to see how many web hits could be generated quoting from a single 50-word post (&#8220;Hello, this is Seth’s sister, Amy, with the sad news&#8230;&#8221;) without any other corroborating sources such as published obituaries, mortuary listings, a Berkley press release, a hospital reference or news articles from even a small or local newspaper, an alumni newsletter, other public family statements  &#8230; anything.

			<p>This is truly heart-breaking news. Such a loss.</p>
<p>Two things always amazed me about Seth. </p>
<p>First, that he was such an original thinker &#8212; really, truly, genuinely original, in a deep and intelligent way. </p>
<p>Second, that he managed to remain so optimistic and so cheerful! He did this despite facing the incomprehension and neglect which comes from being so  original. I am sure he could have made his life much easier, professionally, by doing work that was more conventional. But he did not.</p>
<p>In this way, he has been a model to me both intellectually and emotionally, a model I do not expect to live up to.</p>
<p>I was working on a project that I was very keen to share with him (an app inspired by his blog posts on Magic Dots), and it&#8217;s hard to believe now I will never have the chance to show him.</p>
<p>I am sure his passing is a great loss not only for us but for the many people who do not know him at all, but certainly would have benefited from his curiosity and his courage.</p>

			<p>Seth!<br />
I just learned tonight why you failed to show up on the 26th of April as we had planned.  I didn&#8217;t want to bug you so I didn&#8217;t call or email to ask what happened.  Now I know.  I finally sent an email tonight asking if you were alright&#8211;&#8217;cause it wasn&#8217;t like you to disappear.  I am in shock to know that my worse fears are true.</p>
<p>Seth came to see me after the publication of The Chair in 1998.  No other colleague sought me out on the basis of ideas.  Turns out we were both Reedies, and I proposed that we teach a course together, &#8220;The office of the future&#8221; (which we thought of as neolithic).  We did, twice, once with others from the business school, &#8220;The Post-Dilbert Office.&#8221; We were both interested in nutrition and food and ate together in NYC and the Bay area intermittently.  We had dinner at the new restaurant that replaced O Chame on April 24.  He offered to help me with some computer issues on the afternoon of the 26th.  </p>
<p>Seth, my friend, this is your friend Galen, saying farewell&#8211;and re-opening to the depth of appreciation I have for you.  You&#8217;d love the book I&#8217;m reading now.  Dang, I wish we could talk about it after you read it.<br />
Love,<br />
Galen</p>
