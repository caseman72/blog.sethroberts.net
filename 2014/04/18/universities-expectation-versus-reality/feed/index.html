The committee went on to criticize my weight-control ideas: “Eating bad-tasting food may lead to sustained weight loss, but only in those
who have the self-discipline to adhere to such a regimen.” My conclusions were not likely to generalize, in other words, because hardly anyone will have enough self-discipline.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, that last link was interesting to me.  I liked this:
&lt;&gt;

You point out that you never advocated eating bad-tasting food.  But even if you had, is expecting people to stick to this any crazier than expecting people to permanently cut calories every day for the rest of their lives??  The normal diet advice figuratively pits people against their own brains and tells them to keep up the fight for (say) 60 years.  Oh yeah, and the success rate is near 0%.

I often tell people who think that we&#039;ve already &quot;cured&quot; obesity (just have a little self-discipline, stop shoveling food down your throat) that I&#039;ve invented a cure for heroin addiction: Stop using heroin!  Yet any doctor who proposed this would (correctly) be laughed at.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, I don&#039;t disagree with you. We only disagree on how much I think people are willing to spend or give up to have a piece of paper that proves they aren&#039;t ignorant. Intellectual insecurity is rampant. I am utterly bemused by its ubiquity. Until everyone stops worrying how smart other people think they are, especially members of the credentialed class, universities will continue to jack up the price of token diplomas and kids will continue consigning themselves to the poorhouse to protect their egos.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pardon me, I was thinking in terms of the distribution of IQ, or something very much like IQ. Your distinction is the right one. That said, baristas would rather live a life of debt peonage than admit they can&#039;t hack it in university. Like I said, there&#039;s nothing worse these days than being anything less than smart, and as long as you need a college diploma to be above suspicion young people will remain only too willing to commit financial suicide.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, college is becoming a bad investment for much of the top x percent, too. The quarter of a million dollars (and up) it takes to get a decent degree (at a decent school) these days could be invested (say, by someone&#039;s parents), and over time that should more than offset any &quot;long-term income penalty.&quot; [The &quot;investor&quot; should have somewhere between 2.5 and 3.0 million dollars after, say, 35 years, with even a modest rate of return.] And possibly even allow the &quot;student&quot; to do something he or she actually wants to do, like create a business, write a killer program, learn a rare skill, invent something, etc. And the culture will change once parents and students realize that, for the vast majority, paying $250,000+ for an education is a bad investment. And the coming increase in ZMP workers only makes the need for change more urgent.

Academia got greedy. And in the immortal words of Rev. Jeremiah Wright, &quot;the chickens are coming home to roost.&quot;  Maybe not this year, or next, but soon...says just another guy with an opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not that college is becoming a bad investment for the bottom x percent; it&#039;s that some majors are not good investments, and are becoming financially suicidal as the price tag rises. A degree in engineering or computer science is an excellent investment. But a degree in English, history or anthropology? Fine if you have a trust fund, but if you&#039;re going to college and expecting to support yourself after, you&#039;d be better off using that time and money to start a business. At least that debt can be discharged through bankruptcy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, you illustrate the problem. If someone writes a book he&#039;s an authority. If someone condenses the essence of a book&#039;s argument into a couple sentences he&#039;s just another guy with an opinion. The demand for impressive windiness is one of the reasons academics remain powerful.

I keep reading that college is a becoming a bad investment for the bottom x percent, but the culture is such that I think many people would take a long-term income penalty in order to prove they aren&#039;t uneducated. We have a long way to go before this &quot;bubble&quot; pops, or before this system fundamentally changes, esp. with the coming increase in ZMP workers.]]></description>
