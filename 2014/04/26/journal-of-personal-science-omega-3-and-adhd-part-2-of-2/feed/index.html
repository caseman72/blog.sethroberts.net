		<description><![CDATA[Awesome article Allan.

I (and my family, co-workers, etc.) also notice (!!!) when I stop taking my fish oil. I&#039;ve been through several cycles of self-experimentation on this, and I can say w/o a shadow of a doubt that it makes for a large positive difference in my mood, outlook, level of anxiety, speed of thought, etc. I&#039;m 50 y/o now and often wonder what life would have been like if I would have discovered Omega-3 supplementation sooner. My first-born son is the &quot;spitting image&quot; of me at that (teen)age, both good and bad, and this article FINALLY put it all together for me regarding my son&#039;s behavioral challenges. So, while I&#039;m still able to have a strong influence over his choices, I&#039;m going to insist that he start supplementing as well.

With all of the information out there (now) on ADHD and the &quot;spectrum&quot;, I recognize some of those symptoms in myself and son, so there seems to be some of that correlation with us as well.

Finally, I&#039;ve found Krill Oil to be particularly effective for me. I do think the &quot;phospholipid carrier&quot; (vs. triglyceride) marketing of Krill Oil suppliers is more than hype in my case.

BTW - Is there a strong Northern European component to you or your wife&#039;s lineage? If so, I would not be surprised. I gather others have noticed a correlation of omega-3 / behavior / mood for people w/ that ancestry as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was taking Wellbutrin for &quot;adult&quot; ADD. It had pretty much saved my life when I finally realized that I had ADD when I was 40, and had been experiencing it for most of my life. After a number of year,though, I wanted to get off the drug, and read a Purdue study that indicated 50% of boys with ADD had Omega-3 deficiencies. So I started taking fish oil caps, and was able to stop the Wellbutrin. It&#039;s true that it&#039;s probably not great to take unlimited amounts of fish oils. But given the alternatives, I would recommend erring on the side of getting enough, then start cutting back until you find the correct amount. And adding fatty fish to the diet, as well as getting the gut microbiota in good shape with pre- and probiotics. 90% of the neurotransmitters produced in the body are produced by intestinal bacteria. If your gut is screwed up, your brain will be, too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone. I really appreciate it. I prefer to be the private type, but I feel helping people by getting the word out about O3 is important.

@babar -- I feel very much the same way about schools&#039; treatment of boys today. However, he was not functioning well at home either. To a certain extent I&#039;m sure school wore him down and that spilled over into home life, but life wasn&#039;t grand prior to kindergarten either. Regardless, O3 makes a huge, noticeable difference.

@babar &amp; max -- Concerning delivery, they are large pills that the kids chew up. Our oldest son has always been adventurous towards foods and eating, and the others started young enough they didn&#039;t know a difference. When our youngest was a baby I would pierce it with a fork and let him suck it out while I held the capsule. Seemed gross to me but he loved it. The capsules pop loudly and squirt in your mouth when you bite into them. I call them firecrackers and they like that, complaining even when they occasionally don&#039;t get a good pop for whatever reason. Finally, though we take fermented cod liver oil straight and quickly chase it with food, I&#039;ve read of people mixing it with just enough peanut butter, yogurt, or ice cream to carry it across the tongue and down the gullet. I think the same should work for any liquid oil.

@Alex &amp; Mehmet -- Thanks, I&#039;ll check them out. One thing I&#039;ve learned is that many parents who have gone the prescription drug route really don&#039;t like hearing about alternatives.

@Adam -- While I haven&#039;t seen those specific links, I do share concern about over-doing the O3. It&#039;s partly why I was under-dosing for so long, and repeatedly testing my son&#039;s response to taking him off it every couple or few months. My preference is for as small a dose as he can tolerate, though I see Seth has discovered what seems to be large, bordering on incredible, doses make a commiserate improvements. It&#039;s also possible unrefined flax seeds are metabolized differently whereby overdosing it not a concern.

@Andrew -- I guess whatever works for somebody, but if one is aiming for a specific physiological effect, I think the dose needs to be more carefully measured than a &quot;swig.&quot; :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Max, Carlsons &quot;Very Finest Fish Oil&quot; with lemon flavor in the pint bottles, while expensive, is surprisingly good tasting. 

I recently read someone on the net recommending just drinking small gulps of the Carlsons directly from the bottle. I haven&#039;t done that yet, but it definitely seems more convenient than pouring it out every time I want to take a dose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An especially interesting read. Thank you for your generosity in sharing this story.

My own sense is that oily fish must have been a more important part of the human diet, so our bodies need that oil and with the modern diets we have, we usually don&#039;t get it unless in a pill. Ditto fermented vegetables.

I share the frustration at how quick-on-the-trigger so many doctors are to prescribe pharmaceuticals, many of them on the market with very dubious data behind them, and when there are alternatives without dangerous side effects.]]></description>
