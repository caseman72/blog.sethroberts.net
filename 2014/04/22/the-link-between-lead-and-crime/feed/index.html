		<description><![CDATA[For pure health reasons, there is plenty of cause to &quot;get the lead out.&quot;    We need to do more and faster. 

But that is different from pinning the blame for violence on lead.   

Here is an article which takes a skeptical look at the lead-violence link.  The issue is not so obvious.    The article gives academic references.  

http://www.samefacts.com/2014/04/crime-incarceration/lead-and-crime-a-hole-in-the-theory/

Here is another idea.   Modern chemicals reduce testosterone in males, and that reduces aggression.    

And another theory.   It is well known that heat, particularly humid heat, put a burden on the body, which must keep the brain cool.   If it is too hot, people become &quot;hot heads.&quot;   An overheated brain will far more easily commit acts of violence.  It is why violence is higher in summer.    The widespead adoption of air conditioning and new dress standards which allow cooler clothing may have reduced violence.   

Could not greater incarceration contribute to lower social violence (outside of prisons, that is)?  

New York has had an exceptionally large drop in violent crime.  Is it not PC to say that aggressive policing made a difference?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The idea that childhood lead exposure causes crime many years later explains so many otherwise-hard-to-explain facts, especially worldwide declines in crime rates, that I conclude it’s true: lead exposure does cause criminality.&quot;

But that might extend to having exposure to lead being used to explain every otherwise inexplicable rise or fall over time.  Does decline in lead explain rises in divorce rates, bastardy, and so on?

Does the lead argument satisfy Bradford Hill&#039;s criteria?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But, gwern, it&#039;s so easy for your sort of experiment to miss the point.  For example, people gathered the statistics for one of the big Australian lead-mining towns.  (Broken Hill, I imagine.)  People there were as healthy as you like - no sign of lead cutting a swathe through them.  But, it seems likely, that if lead in gasoline was the problem then you need to study not the rather large particles (&quot;dust&quot;) emitted by ore mining, but the tiny particles emitted from internal combustion engines. 

dr j: &quot;As a chemist friend of mine said, okay remove lead, remove that as one source of stupidity and replace with partial pyrolysed benzene and other aromatic ring structures in early morning start-ups and by exhaust catalysts that are sub optimal.&quot;  That may be why there was then a war against aromatic compounds in gasoline.  Benzene, once used to wash grease off your hands in the chem lab, was discovered to be far more dangerous than had been understood.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is earlier better? There is an ideal time, where moving the faces earlier or later produces weaker results. The only way I know to figure out the ideal time is trial and error.

Do you have to be staring directly at the faces for this to work? Yes. My guess is that the sensitive period is roughly 2 hours long. During this period you need at least 30 minutes (ideally 50 minutes or more) to get a big useful effect. So you need look directly at the faces for at least 30 minutes during the sensitive period. While looking at the faces you can listen to whatever you want -- music, podcast, book, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I hope this is not a hijack but I had a few questions about the practicalities of morning faces. Apologies if you have covered these questions elsewhere, but I&#039;ve read through your (extremely helpful!) summary page and couldn&#039;t find answers.

1) When you say morning, have you or others found that earlier is better? I get up around 7 am but as a practical matter, it would be easiest to do this while at my desk, around 9:30 or 10. Of course I will endeavor to self-experiment and find out, but would be curious to know if you have any thoughts on this question.

2) Do you find that you need to be staring directly at the faces for this to work? I ask because as a practical matter it would be easiest if I could have this running on my computer screen while I&#039;m doing other things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In grammer school I was taught that the ancient Romans used lead pipes in their cities for plumbing, which poisoned them. Later I discovered that most if not all major cities in the United States use lead pipes throughout the cities to distribute water to homes. The city water, of course, is also filled with poison: arsenic. chlorine. clorates and flouride (flouride is rat poison). Many of the weights that bodybuilders and weightlifters use are filled with lead, with no lead warning label whatsoever on them. 

Either city planners never went to school, refuse to learn from history, or don&#039;t care; or there is a gigantic conspiracy to keep people sick to keep them physically and mentally weak and submissive and trapped in the modern health care system, which is actually a Death Cult. It is amazing that any of us are still alive, considering all of the poisons that exist in our air, water, food and &quot;medicines&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[People who think the &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot; principle does more harm than good, would certainly DEMAND that they NOT be tried for a capital crime (i.e., punishable by death) in a court of law, based solely on correlation. Or I would hope not.

And real lives are also at stake here.

There would be a demand for EVIDENCE, wouldn&#039;t there? Just because there is a far stronger correlation between men and murder than women and murder, a good criminal investigator would never automatically discount the idea that a woman may have committed a particular murder, and not a man. He or she would still look for EVIDENCE, right? Just imagine how many men would unjustly lose their lives if it were otherwise.

It&#039;s the basis for the Hippocratic rule of: First, do no harm.

The reason so many scientists and researchers like to use correlations rather than actual scientific evidence is this: $$$

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; The problem arises where you can’t perform experiments – nobody is going to impose lead or cigarette smoke on a sample of people.

Dearieme, yes yes, everyone knows you can&#039;t experiment on people - *that* way. There&#039;s still ways you can try to experimentally confirm it: for example, instead of focusing on *adding* lead, focus on *removing* it; you can go find an area with lots of lead in its building, pay for random buildings to be renovated and de-leaded, and monitor outcomes of their inhabitants. This will require a lot more money and data than if you could add big doses of lead (since generally there&#039;s not that much lead you can remove so the effect will be small), but it&#039;s doable if there&#039;s will.

Unfortunately, there isn&#039;t. Most people don&#039;t appreciate the value of this sort of research. (How much would an experimental confirmation or debunking of the effect of lead on crime be worth over the next century? Billions, at a minimum. Is anyone running these sorts of experiments? Nope.)]]></description>
