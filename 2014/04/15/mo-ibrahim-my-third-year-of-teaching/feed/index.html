		<description><![CDATA[Thinking aloud:  WHY are students apathetic?  Why?  How do we draw those kids in?  How do we get them to learn the basics needed to just be motivated, dedicated citizens?  Is there anything you see which helps?  Smaller classes?  More structured class?  Less structured class?  Presenting it as it will appear to them in real life?  Anything?

Loved the mention of the act now, ask forgiveness later.  Not really great thought, but seems very applied and sometimes necessarily so.  And I had not heard of the &quot;please&quot; one,  but I will store that away for sure.

Good post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the review, Mo. I have a question.

&quot;I can’t recall using any other teaching techniques that I was exposed to during graduate school.&quot;

Since you&#039;re not using any techniques from your graduate school training -- yet you are teaching -- how/where did you pick up your teaching &quot;know how&quot;? Is it modeled on what you observed your own teachers do, or...?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Data from some countries (e.g. Finland and Poland) do not support your claim.&quot;  Then it&#039;s not a failed experiment in those countries.  They&#039;ll do very well to keep it that way.

&quot;why would non state education fix that?&quot;  Because doing away with a monopoly run on rigid doctrinal lines has every chance of leading to the sort of experimentation that will lead to improvements.  In other words, much the usual reason for trying to abolish monopolies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the dismal passing rate is a sign that the material was too sophisticated for the students level of ability, rather than their lack of desire to study.  Strong evidence is that the review immediately prior to the quiz did not have an impact on their scores relative to other times of quiz prep.  There is a body of research, especially as relates to Khan Academy, that indicates where people are learning most efficiently, and that is not the point where they are getting many to most of the answers wrong.

Totally separate is how that came to be that the material was too sophisticated for this specific group of students.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A lot of people in low income areas have higher priorities than studying economics. Many of these young people live in a dangerous, overcrowded environment. And their parents and peer groups can&#039;t or simply don&#039;t place a high emphasis on academic learning. 

Given that reality, what kind of results can we reasonably expect teachers, schools or even government to deliver? (Even in solidly middle class schools, many students are apathetic when confronted with academic economics.)

The older I get, the more difficulty I have in believing that we can just slap an &quot;education system&quot; on top of a free, loosely regulated, highly individualistic collection of people (i.e. America) and expect high quality results. 

For most of us, learning a complex academic subject requires patience, focus, time, and work. In our system, a lot of that is is solely under personal control. 

Sure, a government program in a free society can help with some of these things. But we don&#039;t live in a totalitarian, Soviet-style system where we can force kids to spend ten hours a day reading a physics textbook and working out homework problems. 

We live in a free society. The school police are not allowed to come to my house and force me to read about the law of cosines. 

I have no doubt that we Americans -- across the board -- could excel at quantum mechanics, organic chemistry, and writing just-in-time compilers if we wanted to spend ten hours a day doing those things. But that&#039;s not what we&#039;re in to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a friend who just quit teaching due to student apathy.  It&#039;s sad, because at one time she was so excited about teaching.  She said she was out of ideas for how to make her students care.  She was teaching at a small rural school where half the students ended up dropping out.]]></description>
