		<description><![CDATA[I liked this story. One of my sisters could read before first grade, the other struggled for some time. They are both of them very smart, and very different, individuals.

Not too long ago it occurred to me that the educational system in this country is a disaster. I went from being generally against home schooling in most circumstances to supportive of it in most circumstances. It&#039;s not the teachers, the vast majority want to be good teachers, but even great teachers in our system are only allowed to be good. Nor do I think that the upcoming for-profit reforms will improve things for most kids.

So when I heard my nephew will be home schooled, I thought, great.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[davids: what you&#039;re describing is pretty much the Montessori method used by the elementary school my daughter attended in the Netherlands. Each child works independently, either individually or in small groups of two or three, on modules of math, reading, etc., which are identified by colors and flora/fauna rather than any visible hierarchy (1, 2, or A, B, etc.). The teacher checks your progress when you&#039;ve finished the green fish module in math, for instance, and tells you to go on to the pink tulips. Each child progresses at their own pace, with as much help from the teacher as they need. First through third grade are all in the same room, working through the same modules. Of course this is very demanding of the teachers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;first child didn’t read or show any interest in reading to herself until about second grade (7 years old)&lt;/i&gt;

FWIW, that&#039;s the Finnish model. Waldorf too. Students of both systems seem to do OK for themselves.

The standard American education model seems to have the idea that brains are empty buckets into which we pour knowledge at some pre-ordained and invariate, X. Ergo, if we want smarter people we must begin pouring knowledge sooner. Of course, the truth is smarter people are able to learn and remember at rates far greater than X, multiples in the case of geniuses. And dumber people retain at rates far below X. And then there is the difference in capacities. Finally, on top of those, as Terri&#039;s story illustrates, different people learn and remember things differently depending on how the material is presented and conveyed.

It&#039;s all so messy when your goal is to use early 20th century mass production techniques to optimize throughput.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reply of davids sounds great!  Why can&#039;t it be done this way?  Seth&#039;s reply reminds me of how I don&#039;t allow my kids to use the word &quot;smart.&quot;  Makes me cringe.  They can say...John knows his chemistry or Janie plays piano like a champ or Sally uses the biggest words I have ever heard.  But not &quot;smart.&quot;  That artistic student described could draw anything and Seth could obviously spell well, read well, and get all his math work right--each child &quot;smart&quot; in their own right.  Sadly, both probably felt so alienated by the handling of their strengths by the academic institution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I skipped fourth grade but it shouldn&#039;t have taken such a massive dislocation to make the work challenging for me. Likewise, I remember one student was held back a grade. That was awful. I still remember what a good artist he was. Much better to start with the idea that everybody has their own strengths and their own speed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more. I&#039;ve long held a belief that we should do away with fixed time lengths for grades (as in, Third Grade is a nine month length of time). This doesn&#039;t make any sense, and we don&#039;t need a very advanced appreciation of different learning styles to understand this. Some kids learn math relatively faster than others, some develop reading comprehension faster, etc. We should split up reading, writing, math into separate classes. When a student displays mastery of a certain level of, say, math, that student moves on to the next level of math. It shouldn&#039;t matter whether that mastery is achieved at the same time as other students, or whether it takes one month or 18 months. Moving between levels should be fluid. Any given math class may contain older students who are learning math at a relatively slower pace, and younger students who are learning math at a relatively quicker pace. 

Additional benefit: outlier students learning any particular subjects at extremely slow rates can much more easily be identified and assisted, then would be the case when a block of students move from grade level to grade level every year, all together, in all subjects, at the same time. 

A system like this should theoretically work fairly well until high school, when students begin selecting their own courses and specializing with languages, arts, AP courses, etc.]]></description>
