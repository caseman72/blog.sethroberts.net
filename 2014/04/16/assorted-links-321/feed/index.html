		<description><![CDATA[What interested me was perhaps their overall health despite quite a bit of honey and tubers.  Their diet didn&#039;t seem all that diverse as stated in the articles I have read.  I kind of mull that over in my mind as I think about how it is recommended to us to eat a diverse diet.  Is diversity overrated?  But then without diversity how do they/we acquire select nutrients.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dearieme, universities were also once bastions of free speech and non-conformity (e.g., compare Berkeley circa 1966 with Berkeley circa 2014). Not anymore. Orwellian newspeak, doublethink, thoughtcrime and PC propaganda rule the roost today. Even historically Catholic universities have been infected with this horrible virus. And it&#039;s not by accident. That &quot;long march through the institutions&quot; is proceeding exactly as planned.]]></description>
