		<description><![CDATA[Talking about bread.  I tried the fashionable &quot;no-knead&quot; bread recipe last year and had good results (that&#039;s just flour, salt, water, and a very small amount of yeast with a very long rising period).  When Cooks Illustrated offered a new take on that recipe specifically to increase the taste of fermentation, calling their loaf  &quot;almost no-knead bread.&quot;  That recipe adds beer and vinegar and produces a delicious loaf.  As everyone liked the result of my experimentation, I bravely ordered sourdough starter and gave that a go, but didn&#039;t have much luck until I cut the amount down to about 2 tablespoons (considering it part of the liquid in the recipe) and kept the 1/4 teaspoon of yeast that was in the original recipe.  (Remaining sourdough starter can be frozen with great success.)   That process created a very flavorful loaf.  Reading your blog post about the importance of feeding the good intestinal bacteria, I replaced two tablespoons of the King Arthur European-style bread flour that I have been using with high gluten corn flour as recommended and let the dough rise for a full 24 hours.  Everyone loves it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[does (fermented) bread count as fermented food?

Maybe. I suppose there are a lot more bacterial fragments in bread than in non-fermented food and maybe these bacterial fragments help protect you against dangerous bacteria. I don&#039;t know.]]></description>
