		<description><![CDATA[Quote from post above: &quot;The only information about his blood pressure was in the Beijing report where it was recorded at 117/87. &quot;

That indicates a rather narrow pulse pressure.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_pressure

117 systolic minus 87 diastolic = 30 pulse pressure  

30/117=25.65%

Quote from Wikipedia:&quot;A pulse pressure is considered abnormally low if it is less than 25% of the systolic value. The most common cause of a low (narrow) pulse pressure is a drop in left ventricular stroke volume. In trauma a low or narrow pulse pressure suggests significant blood loss (insufficient preload leading to reduced cardiac output).

If the pulse pressure is extremely low, i.e. 25 mmHg or less, the cause may be low stroke volume, as in Congestive Heart Failure and/or shock.

A narrow pulse pressure is also caused by aortic valve stenosis and cardiac tamponade.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like Melissa, I cringed while reading comments demanding to know the cause of Seth&#039;s death.

Still, as someone who has adopted several dietary changes based on his work (and tested their efficacy), I have to admit to wanting to know those details because they seem important. But I know that I have no right to that information, and can imagine that as a family member, it must be hard to publish it.

I really appreciate that you did so, when you didn&#039;t have to.]]></description>

I was deeply saddened to learn of Seth&#039;s untimely death. I worked with Seth on the writing of The Shangri-La Diet. We had a lot of fun and learned a lot from each other.

		<description><![CDATA[Justine - I am a friend of Seth&#039;s here in Berkeley.  I have already been in touch with Amy, and want to communicate my condolences to you also.  His passing came as quite a shock to me.  I can&#039;t imagine how it might have been for you.

Since you have brought up the issue of the hair test (actually, there were multiple), and since I am the one who was involved with Seth on this issue, perhaps it is now appropriate for me to say something about it.  Seth had a mouthful of amalgam fillings.  Worse, he also had gold in his mouth; and when differing metals are in combination like this in the same mouth, the less noble one will just dissolve into the saliva.  Dental text-books are quite clear that these combinations should be avoided, but dentists routinely ignore it.  While I had talked to Seth for a long time about the issue, it was only when I got him access to a Jerome mercury vapor meter that he took it seriously.  The level of mercury vapor in his oral cavity was astronomical.  If I remember correctly, it was measured at nearly 60mcg/m^3, some 200x EPA limits for long-term exposure.  (That&#039;s off the top of my head.  If relevant, I can check those numbers.)  As a result, he had his amalgam fillings removed.

Subsequently, Seth began to do hair tests, which were uniformly and over a period of years, high in mercury.  I tried to tell him that the problem was not gone.  That the half-life of mercury in the brain is some 25 years, and so he needed to consider the question of detoxification.  Particularly as some of his symptoms, including the insomnia, were certainly consistent with mercury toxicity.  And, his need for so many omega-3 oils seemed to indicate a high rate of oxidation of these oils in the body.  He listened, but never really did anything about it.  Since the main targets of mercury toxicity are the electrical tissues (brain &amp; heart) and the detoxification organs (liver, kidney &amp; skin), I can&#039;t help but think that this must have been a factor in his untimely death.  I am sorry to have lost a good friend.  I encourage others to consider this aspect of health quite seriously.  To explore it further, you can contact DAMS at amalgam.org.  They keep a list of amalgam-free dentists and sympathetic MD&#039;s.  (Though beware of their detoxification advice.)  You might also join the adult-metal-chelation@yahoogroups.com and frequent-dose-chelation@yahoogroups.com lists, and have a look at the books &quot;Amalgam Illness: Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; and &quot;Hair Test Interpretation: Finding Hidden Toxicites&quot; by Andrew Cutler (noamalgam.com).  These latter resources provide a slow, low dose, physiologically appropriate detoxification protocol.  (It&#039;s not just the detests who are failing to read their textbooks.  When it comes to chelation, the MD&#039;s don&#039;t do follow their own advice on the proper dosing of pharmaceuticals.)]]></description>

A note for Seth&#039;s family -- I&#039;m so sorry for your loss.  I work for the BBC World Service in London.  We interviewed Seth for a radio program we did a few years back on the new breed of self-trackers.  If you would like a copy of an mp3 of the interview please drop me an email (jeff dot baird at gmail) and I&#039;ll try to dig out a copy of it from our archives.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading Seth blog for about a year, but recently stopped for a couple of months. I read his posts from a RSS reader and just begun reading from where I left of. I could not have expected something so tragic could happen. I can feel your pain and the pain of all the readers who have found in Seth the hope of a  solution for their health problems. I&#039;m very sorry for your lost and I wish to thank you deeply for informing us about the cause of his death. Something you would not have to do, but probably did knowing your son would have liked it so. Thank you. I send you all my love. Maybe someday, this blog would become a book. I think it should, so we could remember him more deeply, like we had a part of him in our home, and our hearth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Justine and Amy,

I am so sorry to hear of Seth&#039;s passing, and please accept my deepest sympathies for your loss.

I met Seth when I was living in Berkeley and in law school.  He was such an intelligent, creative, and caring person, as well as quirky and fun.  Doing things with Seth was always an interesting adventure.  I can&#039;t believe that he is gone...

Seth&#039;s spirit will continue to live on in all of the people that he touched in his life and in all of our memories.

		<description><![CDATA[Justine and Amy (and family)--

I am so deeply sorry for your loss and appreciate your posts here. I&#039;ve read Seth&#039;s blog regularly since 2006 and was for a short time a participant in the SLD forums. And I will always be glad that an exchange with Seth just a few months ago led to an e-mail where I explained what I had learned from his work and how I had put the principles from his blog into action.

Since learning of his death, I have felt a real sense of loss. I miss his point of view--I looked forward to seeing where his inquiry took him and the way his thoughts developed. I can only imagine what it&#039;s like for those who knew him in real life. He was one of a kind. Deepest condolences--
