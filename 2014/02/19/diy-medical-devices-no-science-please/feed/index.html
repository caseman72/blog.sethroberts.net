		<description><![CDATA[I am in medical school right now. My training in nutrition at my school consisted of one powerpoint lecture on vitamins. That’s how it is in most schools. Doctors do not understand proper nutrition, beyond telling patients to “eat a balanced diet”.

I have gained so much benefit from going gluten free, removing mercury fillings, and getting 23andme genetic analysis done (learned I have methylation cycle defects). It is amazing how in the last 2 months I have done more to help my health on my own than doctors have ever done for me.

I hope to be a different kind of doctor, one who actually spends more than 10 minutes with a patient and can explain proper nutrition and lifestyle choices. Sadly, with the way healthcare is heading I don’t see myself being part of healthcare teams with nurses running the show (insert sarcastic “thanks Obama!”). I think I will probably have my own concierge practice in a wealthy area like Beverly Hills or Manhattan.]]></description>

This sounds very similar to the philosophy of this blog.]]></description>
