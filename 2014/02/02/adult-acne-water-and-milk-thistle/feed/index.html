		<description><![CDATA[I recently started taking D3 4000iu a day, just because there&#039;s no sunshine here in England. A pleasant side effect was that 4 persistent spots on my forehead have disappeared. Medication wouldn&#039;t shift them but now they&#039;ve gone. A quick search pulled up the same experience for other people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Vitamin C trick to remove chlorine works. It only takes a pinch per five gallon bucket. I used to do this for my plants. If you have a white bucket try it. Add a pinch then stir. Look in the bottom and you will see a small grain in the middle. That&#039;s the chlorine. The info comes, if I remember correctly, from the San Fransisco water department.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good to know about milk thistle.  In case anyone cares, I&#039;ve had great success with taking 100 mg zinc picolinate daily.  I recently started applying apple cider vinegar (1 part ACV to 2 parts water) to my face 1-2 times daily.  It seems to have worked really well, though this could be a coincidence.  I&#039;ll keep observing for a  few more weeks before concluding anything.

I think I got both these suggestions from the SLD forums.]]></description>

By the way I discovered that soluble barley drink (tries to imitate Coffee) in the evening improves sleep, especially when you had a active day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;But about 15 years later — about a year ago — I began to experience significant breakouts again, this time confined largely to my nose&quot;

makes me wonder if your water supplier made a change...something that your water filter could not block/clean.

Adding Chloramine comes to mind (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloramine).
I read somewhere this has become more common in recent years...&#039;chlorine on steroids&#039; perhaps.
As far as i know only Vitamin C type filters remove/negate this stuff (or adding Vit C to drinking water &amp; bath water).

You should be able to find out what&#039;s in your water by checking info on the suppliers web site. It still doesn&#039;t change anything i guess...but would be interesting to know. (pls post up if you find they do use chloramine)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had awful adult acne, hideous cystic lumps that left scars.  My college pictures are hard to look at. This continued into late twenties.

It was a food allergy, but took forever to figure out:  black tea.  Especially Oolong.  My face would begin to itch within minutes of drinking, and the breakout came the following day.  But it took years to notice the connection, I&#039;m embarrassed to say.

The allergy -- if that&#039;s what it is -- is highly specific.  Green tea is no problem.  Coffee is no problem.  The only offender is black tea, especially Oolong.  Even now, in my late forties, I break out if I drink two cups of black tea.  The effect can be mitigated by drinking a ton of water.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[and.............. our cells, bodies and brains have memory.  Once an avenue is established for the excretion of waste products the liver and kidneys cannot process, it continues to use that outlet.   Should one outlet be eliminated, as in the removal of the tonsils, then a new outlet would be established.  

I Found in my own life, that water fasting made a life changing difference.  Many toxins in the body are the residues of past pains whether real or imagined, especially the hurts we collect as children.   The water fasting cleared much of this for me and released the liver and kidneys to do their normal functioning once again.]]></description>
