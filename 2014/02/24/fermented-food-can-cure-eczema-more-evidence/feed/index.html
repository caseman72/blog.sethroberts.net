		<description><![CDATA[I had eczema as a teen and into my early adult years. It came on with a vengeance around age 28. By age 33, it was so bad that I often wished for death. We are talking bloody sheets from my skin splitting open in up to 20 locations during the night; eyes swelling shut from eczema on the lids. It looked as though someone had stabbed me all over. Just terrible and without relief, minute after minute after minute. Then I read on Mangans that fish oil cured a lot of simple health problems and that some Dutch researcher had done a lot of work on fish oil and inflammation. I had already been taking 2g/day of fish oil. I immediately went to 14g per day buying from bulk natural oils (about 2,000 capsules).  Within two weeks my eczema was reduced by &gt;90%.  As soon as I lowered the dose to 6g, the eczema would return. I now use about 10g per day to keep it in check. The Dr&#039;s say I should be wary of heavy metals, but I see no other choice (though I am going to try adding yogurt as per the original post). 

I should mention that during my horrific period of outbreak, I was prescribed and religiously used Elidel for my eyelids and very strong steroids for my hands, arms, back, legs, etc. The efficacy of the steroids compared to fish oil at 14g/day was poor. The side effects of the steroids are very real as well. The skin on my hands is now very thin and I blister easily; this is not a major life problem, but it is worth noting. 

As for experts, when I told the Dr. that I was taking 14g of fish oil per day, he replied, &quot;you mean 14mg...&quot;  I admire much of the medical community, but so much of it is just out of whack. I am sure Dr.s are over regulated and face a litany of challenges, but the end result is substandard care. I should mention that I consulted more than eight dermatologists over a period of six years. Not one mentioned fish oil as a potential solution. They are all one thing: diagnose then drugs. 

Now I only get flare ups from vasodilators likes niacin and yohimbine (great stuff when matched to dmaa and caffeine; otherwise perfectly terrible).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I started with 1 tablespoon four times a day. For the first week or so I was getting a lot of gas. Not painful or smelly, just a lot of it. After the first week it subsided, along with the vivid dreams I was getting at night. I doubled up to see if the dreams, the gas, or both would come back. I honestly have no idea what the &quot;correct&quot; dose of potato starch is... I am just playing with it &amp; experimenting at this point. It isn&#039;t as if I titrated the dose to the eczema -- I actually didn&#039;t even notice the eczema disappearing, as it wasn&#039;t that bad to begin with. One day I just examined my wrists &amp; found it was completely gone.]]></description>

How did you arrive at 4 times per day? 

Did, say, 2-3 tablespoons once per day not work?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had 2 small patches of eczema on my left &amp; right wrists while I was living in China. When I got back to the US I started eating Greek yogurt mixed into 2 tablespoons of Potato starch four times a day. The eczema has gone away completely.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good to know. I hope this blog will be an eczema-free zone.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
