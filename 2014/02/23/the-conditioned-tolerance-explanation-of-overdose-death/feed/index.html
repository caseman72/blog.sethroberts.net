		<description><![CDATA[This phenomenon was discussed in lectures in every psychology course I took in college in the 90&#039;s.  Friends I had at low-end state schools at the time also learned the same thing in their intro-level psych courses.  Very old news, and widely known.  

They always discussed the case of the girl found ODed in Grand Central Station who took half of her regular dose that she usually injected at home.  Sounds suspiciously like the &quot;case study&quot; cited from 2006.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth - I wonder if your 2007 blog post on visual and auditory cues possibly raising the body&#039;s set point could function in a similar manner.

&quot;I’m not surprised that auditory and visual signals for food cause hunger. There are lots of conditioned cravings like that. Tim goes on to wonder if these learned signals for food raise the body-fat setpoint, as the theory behind the Shangri-La Diet says that food-associated flavors do. If you walk by your favorite bakery every day, will you weigh more than if you don’t? &quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm... That wouldn&#039;t work, because if there&#039;s no pulse, the naltrexone isn&#039;t getting to the brain.

Maybe it could detect shallow breathing, then sound an alarm, then if no response, an injection?]]></description>

Of course, there&#039;s then the issue of moral risk. But if Hoffman had had one he&#039;d still be here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I, too, had read about the idea, I believe in a 2004 ARP paper on smoking.

But I had never considered it in connection to a data point that one often sees cited in connection with addiction. The data point is that, apparently, there were many U.S. soldiers who got addicted to Heroin in Vietnam, but many of whom quit when they came home.

This is quite often cited in support of the idea that addiction/drug consumption is a choice (rather than something that is beyond the addict&#039;s control). I think I may also have seen it linked to the sociological idea of framing (different situations trigger different behaviours). 

Be that as it may, it suggests that the best moment to quit is when you know you&#039;ll be in unfamiliar situations a lot. It may also help explain why I drink so much more coffee in the office than at home.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Siegel has emphasized that Vietnam heroin data. I&#039;d say the best moment to quit is when you change where you live -- when starting grad school, for example. Or moving to a new apartment. Or even to a new office in the same building. You make a good point, I have never heard &quot;move to a new apartment, change your workplace&quot; as part of how to get rid of an addiction.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does this imply that people who want to get the most for their money from drugs should keep taking them in different circumstances?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes. I think if you really want to keep the cost down you should wear headphones and listen to different music each time. Maybe clip your nose shut to reduce smells to focus more attention on sound.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
