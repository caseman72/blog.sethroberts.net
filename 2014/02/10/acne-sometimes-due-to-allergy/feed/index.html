		<description><![CDATA[I had terrible adult acne and spent years looking either spotty or patchy because my skin turned a nastly mottled colour. Even when not really &#039;breaking out&#039; my skin was bumpy all over my face.  I found the cure accidentally when I started taking niacin (B3) for my cholesterol.  The acne went away in less than two weeks.  I&#039;ve heard of the same thing happening to someone else but with B5. I now only need to take niacin about once a month (100mg) to keep the acne gone.  It takes about 6 months for it to recur if I stop completely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Antropops taught me that acne is the body disposing of bad blood associated with unsuitable or unwanted DNA in the maturing person.  Hence, if it persists into full adulthood, it would indicate a person not fully coming to grips with the traumas of youth.  And lets face it, all of us thought we were badly done by, aye?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A while back I read a paper where they analyzed the sebaceous gland output of 10 adults, and found that each individual&#039;s sebum had a distinct, markedly different, fatty acid/wax ester profile.  Maybe that&#039;s one reason bloodhounds can tell us apart, but it also explains why acne sufferers blame a wide variety of trigger foods for their blocked pores (for me, it&#039;s definitely cheese and trans fat, but I don&#039;t have any problem with chocolate or tea).

I feel some sympathy for dermatologists, who can hardly be expected to determine an individual&#039;s unique food sensitivities in a 15-minute office visit.  But they could do a better job of pushing patients to pay attention to their diets and do their own experimentation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dermatology should be viewed as an industry, like any other. They don&#039;t want to loose customers. 

It&#039;s kind of like how the tobacco industry for a long, long time, refused to admit the connection between smoking and cancer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s infuriating that for a variety of conditions doctors say, &quot;diet does not affect xxx.&quot; They can correctly say, &quot;We do not have evidence that diet makes a difference in xxx,&quot; but instead go for the broader, false, &quot;We have evidence that diet does not make a difference in xxx.&quot;

Personal science has been a lifesaver for me in navigating the gap between those two statements.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: There is plenty of evidence that diet causes acne. E.g., dairy. Dermatologists ignore it. Then they claim the opposite. That they are not ridiculed for doing this is interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
