		<description><![CDATA[The Odyssey and Iliad come out of &lt;i&gt;oral&lt;/i&gt; traditions of storytelling. When you&#039;ve got 11,000 lines to recite, repetition gives your hearers a chance to assimiliate and gives you a break at the same time.

This highly non-repetitive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/articles/911-truther-vows-not-to-rest-until-everyone-knows,35319/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Onion piece&lt;/a&gt; cracked me up, because the writers used as many different synonyms as they could think of for “a##hole”.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read The Odyssey for my A Levels in school and I remember the formulaic descriptions of things like the sunrise. I found this increasingly frustrating and it detracted from my enjoyment of the book.

Why was it so annoying? I guess it felt lazy and it was just really boring to re read the same phrases and descriptions over and over. I couldn&#039;t mentally &#039;buy in&#039; to the description of a beautiful sunrise after I&#039;d read the same description 10 times.

Outside of my day job I run a small record label. Writing is not one of my strong points and creating press releases is a hard task. I have to come up with many different way of referring to the same thing - &quot;the album, released today&quot;, &quot;the band&#039;s full length debut was recorded at...&quot;, &quot;the band had this to say about their self-titled release...&quot; etc.

I figure the people I&#039;m sending these to must read many of them every day so I need to keep it as interesting as possible.

As always, context is important. I would assume in a research paper its acceptable to use the same, and probably very particular, terms for things.

Is this the case?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since language variation demonstrates mental agility and creativity, we might be unconsciously motivated to do it to show off, to help attract the opposite sex.

Why do we have so many songs, or even one song?  Maybe for the same reason we have oral sex: it&#039;s appreciated.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: When I hear that this or that feature of human behavior evolved for the sake of showing off to the opposite sex -- and I hear it often -- I think, sarcastically, thank goodness things are so simple. There is certainly a lot of sexual signalling and as far as I know it is always very asymmetric: one sex does it much more than the other (e.g., dance). I am unaware of any sexual asymmetry in language variation. Both men and women do it, roughly the same amount.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was in college, the professor who helped to improve my writing the most would make us read our papers out loud to him.  I was reading a paper about Plato to him, and he stopped me because he could not follow my train of thought.  It turned out that my unconscious training to avoid using the same phrase repeatedly had made the paper incomprehensible.  I remember telling him I had wanted to avoid using the same terms, and he said, &quot;It helps.&quot;]]></description>
