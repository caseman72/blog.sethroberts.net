		<description><![CDATA[My Take:

We learn almost automatically that which is stored in our DNA.  In other words, what our parents knew, we can pick up on without effort.  So we unfold as we grow into adults just as a blow-up Santa Clause does on Christmas Morning.

But beyond that, we have to work at it, as in learning what other DNA strings know, and there is far too much of that for us to ever take it all in.  So we specialize and avoid all information not relevant to our specialty.  

Once all that has been rummaged through, we are in very creative territory, and only when we are aware of the question will we pick up on the answer.  This may take much pain and suffering to attain.  This is why two people hearing the same lecture pick up on different points.  Unless we are ready to take on new ideas, they will just float on over our heads.

Usually the answers to the &#039;exotic&#039; questions will be obvious in ancient texts but having been committed to maxims and clichés are usually ignored. There is nothing new under the sun, only new ways to  express the same form.

In effect we can learn as much as we are willing to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;As a professor yourself, what do you think happens? Do you believe those publications are honestly meaningful? Did all the authors really contribute?&quot;

I believe that the distribution of progress per article follows a power law: A very large fraction of articles contribute very little (make little or no progress), a very tiny fraction of articles make great progress. I also believe the same distribution holds for individuals: If someone has written a hundred papers, and you measure how much progress each paper made, the distribution of those measurements will follow a power law. The problem is with the SLOPE of that power law distribution (relatively flat slope = high average progress per paper, steep slope = low average progress per paper). I think there are aspects of the system, especially the pressure to publish, that make the slope steeper (= reduce average progress per paper).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That last paragraph is the pithiest summary of your thinking, and nails why I keep coming back to your blog.  It may be the most important paragraph I will read this year, I am passing it around to everyone I can think of with my evaluation attached.  It&#039;s  a Seth Roberts coda, at the end but not an ending.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, Cliff, that&#039;s nice to hear. Yes, this blog is a long exploration of that point of view. If I had to do it all over again, I would have named it Personal Science.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I saw the same video with Feynman. He was commenting on nutrition science, how the so-called knowledge on nutrition was not solid, the scientists behind it had not done the hard work that is needed to truly figure things out.

In a related vein, I sometimes see professors who publish several articles per year, or a few hundreds over their careers. I have a very hard time imagining that they have a significant contribution to make to science (the criteria to have an article published, I was told in graduate school) several times per year, or a few hundred times during their careers. As a professor yourself, what do you think happens? Do you believe those publications are honestly meaningful? Did all the authors really contribute?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[“I saw over and over that it was incredibly hard to learn anything. Anything. No doubt all science professors who are honest learn this.”

This also was the line I was going to comment on...but I see it&#039;s also been noted by MJB.  

&quot;We&#039;re wrong a lot&quot; is at this point the center of my epistemology.  You say it very well here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;ve previously posted a comment on this subject, but I&#039;m excited about a new charity called &quot;Give Directly&quot;.  This organization has the radical idea that you can alleviate poverty by giving away money, with no strings attached.

Here&#039;s a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/hollieslade/2014/02/10/give-directlys-breakthrough-free-money-model-grows-as-evidence-mounts/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Forbes&lt;/i&gt; magazine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Give Directly&#039;s Breakthrough &#039;Free Money&#039; Model Grows As Evidence Mounts&lt;/b&gt;

Give Directly has an extremely simple model – find poor people and give them money. That’s it. It’s a radical idea which sometimes rubs people up the wrong way – a popular refrain is, won’t people just drink the money? But the program, which gives extremely poor people in Kenya and Uganda $1000 split over two payments and transferred by mobile phone, is gaining ground thanks to the data it’s gathered backing up its claims. [...]

The system works by removing the usual arbiter, an NGO, and putting money straight into the hand of poor people to spend on whatever they want. Faye hopes the approach will make donors think about more about giving to non-profits – will they do more good with the money then the poor could do themselves?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
