		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Why would a trait be selected for on the basis of its helping others?&quot;

When you help others in many cases you help yourself. For example, when you live with 10 other people you have 10 other brains working to solve your common problems, of which there are no doubt many. By helping those 10 other people, you are helping solve your problems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Amway  mantra is:  Just tell your own story!

I am often criticized (not prosecuted) for practicing medicine without a license, as I occasionally &#039;give out advice.&#039;   This is illegal in most Western Cultures, but isn&#039;t usually prosecuted unless money changes hands.

But to avoid the criticism, my intention is to simply tell my own story, and or give my personal opinions.   Telling my own story is possibly more healing for me than it is for my listeners.  However, even the listeners may remember that story in years to come and benefit from some little part of it.  AND its all so legal to tell your own story and no one knows it better than the individual who lived it!

Nonetheless, when I meet someone whose only conversation is crying about their misfortunes I consider them addicted and tend to avoid that person.

Good post, Seth.   If we want to get some good science, we have to become scientist ourselves, aye?   (and you don&#039;t need a piece of parchment to be a good scientist!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Self-disclosure works better when there is someone on the other end listening.  i think this effect partly explains some of the successes seen by alternative medicine practitioners:  they take much more time to listen than is the norm in conventional medicine these days.  

Also, those who listen may learn surprising and unexpected things that may prove useful in treating others.  I gather that your doctor didn&#039;t learn anything about treating acne from you, but he could have and should have.]]></description>
