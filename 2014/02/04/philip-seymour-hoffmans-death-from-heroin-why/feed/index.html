		<description><![CDATA[Seth: &quot;If he was exposed to the familiar situation many times without exposure to the drug, the familiar situation-drug association may have gone away — been “extinguished” to use the technical term.&quot;

Seth, from all reports, he&#039;s been exposed to the situation AND to the drugs, for quite some time. I don&#039;t think anything was ever truly extinguished. Nor do I think he was ever &quot;dry&quot; for 22 years.

Until more information develops that could change my mind, I&#039;m sticking with Occam&#039;s Razor: He died of a &quot;hot shot.&quot;

Nota bene: I raised and trained field-trial retrievers for many years. I used the principles of classical AND operant conditioning in training. But certain dogs just didn&#039;t respond in the anticipated way. E.g., the same principle that would work so well on dog A wouldn&#039;t work at all on dog B. Behaviorism is a great guideline for training dogs (or as learning theory per se), but it&#039;s riddled with exceptions. Hoffman could be an example of such.]]></description>
