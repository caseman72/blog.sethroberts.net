		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for that answer.  It makes me suspect that we&#039;ve had this conversation before and I&#039;ve forgotten it. Any remedies for bad memory?  (Mine has always been patchy at best.)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, I wrote a post about it several years ago. The post said little more than what I said in my reply so it seemed pointless to link to it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seth, have you ever tried using your tests to compare yourself pre- and post- dental treatment?&quot;

yes, I found that after removal of mercury amalgam fillings my brain test scores substantially improved. I was puzzled by improvement for a long time -- none of my various explanations predicted correctly -- until I noticed that the improvement started exactly at the time of the removal. Those particular fillings were broken. After removal of other fillings, my score did not change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Seth Roberts: China has a very high rate of diabetes, for unknown reasons. Chinese teenagers and college students have much worse (inflamed) skin than I see in other countries.  &lt;/i&gt;

Indians are even worse.  

&lt;i&gt; Sidney Phillips: Recently my parents visited me and brought some take out from an Indian restaurant. Even though I avoided eating anything with gluten and dairy, the next day I felt off. &lt;/i&gt;

Indian restaurants are terrible about reused oil.  It&#039;s not just soybean oil, it&#039;s soybean oil which has been reused several times.  Sometimes, the restaurant will reek of that reused oil stench.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I guess the good news is that the effect went away in a day. The notion that Chinese restaurants (in China) regularly use bad cooking oil is very old news but no one has had any idea how long the effects last. Maybe you get bad skin if your exposure is too frequent.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John Smith: we&#039;ve lately taken to buying Portuguese olive oil, now available in the many Portuguese shops in East Anglia.

And even if we&#039;re wrong, there is the compensation that, so far, it has tasted better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Being considered pre-diabetic, and well aware of how well I sleep at night, I have come to avoid the &#039;Asian&#039; style of cuisine available in my city here in Australia.   The last four or five times I had meals of that type left me quite sleepless that same night.

I suspected the MSG, but did not test at home.   MSG covers a host of names and similar products added to food according to the Wikipedia, but avoiding them all is a task if one eats either processed food or restaurant food.

At home I avoid all bottled oils.  According to one report olive oil is the most written up complaint about substitution and dilution, and if it is that bad with olive oil, why trust all the rest?   

And speaking of dilution and substitution, that same report listed (along with the oil) milk, fruit juice and honey as the top four!]]></description>

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, I agree. It&#039;s not just high-stakes tests. It&#039;s anything requiring a quick response. Since I have managed to become much faster at my brain test I am also much better at catching things when they fall.

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if there might also be something at play with MSG?  
I know several people who feel sick after eating foods -often asian restaurant foods - containing MSG.  Maybe that restaurant uses it?

In any case, would probably be a simple one to test, by spiking a home prepared meal with some MSG and see what your scores do.

Makes me wonder about doing the same with aspartame (NutraSweet), which is neuroactive in some way (stimulant, I think).

Great data, and as you say in comparison to super size me, far easier to test and under more real world conditions, which makes the result more relevant.  All that SSM showed was that an obviously unhealthy diet makes you unhealthy -- we already have plenty of public health/obesity statistics to show that!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good idea about testing MSG and aspartame.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. That’s why these days I really dislike eating out. No matter the cost of the restaurant you know the restaurant will be using the cheapest ingredients possible, especially when it comes to oils. It is just not economically feasible for restaurants to not re-use oils. Maybe the good ones re-use the oil just a few times, who knows though. Re-using oil after frying is not healthy at all.

I had similar results as yours recently. I’ve been on a strict gluten and dairy free diet with great results. Recenly my parents visited me and brought some take out from an Indian restaurant. Even though I avoided eating anything with gluten and dairy, the next day I felt off. I use the Quantified Mind website to track my reaction times and they were noticeably slower. I attributed the bad results to the cheap oil (soybean, corn, canola?) the restaurant must have used. Never again.]]></description>

No matter the cost of the restaurant you know the restaurant will be using the cheapest ingredients possible, especially when it comes to oils. It is just not economically feasible for restaurants to not re-use oils. Maybe the good ones re-use the oil just a few times, who knows though. Re-using oil after frying is not healthy at all.</p>
<p>I had similar results as yours recently. I’ve been on a strict gluten and dairy free diet with great results. Recenly my parents visited me and brought some take out from an Indian restaurant. Even though I avoided eating anything with gluten and dairy, the next day I felt off. I use the Quantified Mind website to track my reaction times and they were noticeably slower. I attributed the bad results to the cheap oil (soybean, corn, canola?) the restaurant must have used. Never again.</p>
