		<description><![CDATA[Seeing as recovery hormones are released when our muscles work, I figure the tossing and turning is an emergency measure to quieten down the endocrine glands.   For just a few seconds after rolling over (in a sleepless fit) one really feels some good endorphins flowing.

With this in mind, I sometimes do some exercises in the wee hours if I can&#039;t sleep.  The success rate varies depending on many other factors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From what I recall, a biphasic sleep schedule is the most natural. One blogger, JD Moyer did a self-experiment where he went without electricity at night &amp; he ended up sleeping about 4 hours, then waking up in the middle of the night for a couple of hours before falling back asleep. Afternoon siestas are pretty common in a natural sleep cycle too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is 4 hours of sleep, some of it very deep, better than 8 hours of shallow sleep?  I can wake up and not feel rested at all even after getting a long night&#039;s sleep. Jared Diamond said in his most recent book that the New Guineans he was familiar with would get up and talk throughout the night, so getting 8-9 hours of straight sleep might not be entirely natural.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, depth of sleep is really important. I haven&#039;t seen Diamond&#039;s latest book but now I am curious what conclusion he drew from his sleep observations. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I have little doubt that sleeping well is a good indicator for immune health, I still have questions about how much it affects it or why it affects it.  I&#039;ve struggled with sleep apnea since I was very young.  About 12 years ago, I decided to begin working out vigorously on a regular schedule.  Before that, I would say that I got an average number of colds and flu&#039;s a year.  Since that time, I only miss a day of work every 3 or 4 years even though I had untreated sleep apnea still.  Even more recently, I&#039;ve managed to beat my apnea after starting the paleo diet so now I&#039;m probably invincible.]]></description>
