		<description><![CDATA[The &quot;Sugar for insomnia&quot; article was interesting. But I thought I&#039;d forget about it before I ever got to use it because I rarely have the type of insomnia this trick addresses (e.g. can&#039;t fall back asleep in middle of night, after waking).

Lo and behold, last night I had this type of insomnia (due to over-training, something I consciously avoid, but couldn&#039;t avoid yesterday). I awoke at 330am and couldn&#039;t fall back asleep. At 530am I decided to give the salt + sugar trick a try, and I was back out like a light. Too bad I had to get up an hour later:(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the sugar for insomnia article: &quot;I’ve even skipped the spoon and just stuck a wet finger into my little sleepy dust container and licked it off, and that works, too. Puts you back to sleep in no time!&quot;

That just makes me think there&#039;s something else going on here. Not exactly placebo, but having to do with degree of suggestibility.

A few granules of sugar and salt puts him back to sleep in no time?

I ain&#039;t buying it. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lactobacillus brevis also is found in pickled turnips.  I&#039;ve used it for weeks and noticed a difference.  It seems to clear my lungs (i probably have a low level infection that once cleared by i took intravenous antibiotics).  I buy the Japanese style fermented turnips.  I&#039;ll try the Japanese pickles, since they probably taste better.]]></description>

Still, fascinating stuff, and now I&#039;m wondering how the diamond cartel has managed to maintain focus instead of just trying to slide along on past dominance.]]></description>
