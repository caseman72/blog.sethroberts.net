		<description><![CDATA[Have you seen this? https://experiment.com/projects/will-vitamin-d-improve-the-health-of-patients-with-heart-failure

One of my favorite sites/services.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Very interesting site, didn&#039;t know about it. Unfortunately these researchers fail to understand the importance of the time of day that the Vitamin D is taken.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gary Taubes, author of &quot;Why we get fat&quot; would disagree; his research establishes that carbs are the culprit.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree with Taubes that food matters. The point of the link was that Marian Nestle was about 60 years behind the times.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
