		<description><![CDATA[Those are good points. I agree, a good reason for take-home exams is to pose interesting thought-provoking questions. 

Here&#039;s another point: Should grades be based (partly) on how smart students are? Or would an ideal grading system be solely a measure of whether they have mastered the material put in front of them by the teacher? If the latter, it is not so obvious that you want to pose problems that separate geniuses from everyone else. If you want to measure learning, not intelligence, you are pushed toward simpler questions.

In my own teaching I avoid tests (and grading) altogether. My goal is learning. I find that other sources of motivation can replace grading. I have no interest in ranking my students according to their intelligence. I wonder why other teachers want to do this -- or are they mindlessly copying how they were taught?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some confirmation of a very recent rise in cheating, but also assertions that core courses are already responding with in-class exams:

http://www.quora.com/California-Institute-of-Technology/Why-are-some-core-classes-at-Caltech-administering-in-class-exams

One of the commenters there recalled something I&#039;d forgotten:  traditionally, Caltech&#039;s honor code exams are unlimited-time and open-book.  This allows exams to ask harder and more interesting questions, which in turn helps solve a challenge in teaching there:  huge variance in student aptitude.

Most Techers scored between 790 and 800 and the SAT math section, but the narrow spread of scores does not imply a narrow spread of aptitude.  Instead, it means the SAT was simply too easy for the top tier of students there.  The right tail on that aptitude distribution is very long.  Traditional in-class, closed-book tests might result in a similar spread to the SAT:  half the class scores 100%, and is bored out of their minds, while the other half has a more normal spread.

Harder questions, open books and no time limits permit a wider variance of outcomes, and more closely resemble real-world problem solving, in which there is typically no time limit.  As long as students are honest.

A second challenge to testing in class is that students can no longer spend 15 hours on a test.  Potential problem, because not every student at this level can think both deeply and fast.  In-class exams would dramatically reduce grade outcomes for honest students that think deeply but deliberately -- a profile that may exactly describe students destined to make great contributions later.

So I don&#039;t have a solution, but begin to appreciate the scope of the challenge.

		<description><![CDATA[The president said there would be sleep deprivation? Counter-productive. Sleep is when long-term memories are formed. Many studies have shown that sleep deprivation reduces long-term learning.

I imagine that anyone at Caltech paying attention, including faculty, realizes there is now lots of cheating. If they (the faculty) keep the honor system in the face of that, they deserve to lose their reputation. It is honest students who suffer. They get lower grades and are tainted by the cheaters.

It&#039;s interesting that honest students don&#039;t band together and demand proctored tests.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually I just realized the honor system was likely working in the 1980s, deducible from two facts:  most courses there were still being graded on a C curve, and individual student scores in applied math and electrical engineering tests often averaged below 70%, with wide variance.

If cheating were rampant at that time, this seemingly could not have occurred.  The bell-curve grading would have driven competition among cheaters, which would either have driven scores up, or driven variance down, or both.  That doesn&#039;t seem to have happened.

I have no idea if any of that is still true today.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The honor system appeared to work when I was there.  Decades later, Caltech remains one of the hardest things I&#039;ve ever done.  As the school&#039;s president put it to incoming students at our orientation, &quot;we will challenge not just your mental limits, but your physical limits,&quot; meaning sleep deprivation.  The intensity was incredible.  Exhausting, but rewired me to think better.  

But it does depend upon the student culture.  If cheating takes root, an honor system can&#039;t work.  I would hate to see them lose a well-earned reputation by not putting a lid on cheating, if it is a growing problem.

		<description><![CDATA[For some reason this didn&#039;t post before, so here it is again...

I graduated from Caltech in the 1980s.  Cheating was rare then, as far as I know.  At risk of sounding quaint, most students attended for knowledge, not prestige or financial gain.  Cheating just wouldn&#039;t be interesting to people I knew there.

I was aware of one small cheating network:  students who knew each other from a particular private high school openly shared answers on homework and take-home tests.  That private high school is in a developing country notorious for corruption.  It is not any of the countries mentioned in previous comments above, and I won&#039;t say which, lest it spawn unproductive nationalist finger-pointing.  

Not to say the other commenters&#039; are wrong.  It&#039;s just that generalizations about cheaters’ ethnic origin are not actionable.  Maybe a more useful observation is that the cheaters I saw at Caltech had, compared to the rest of us, bigger incentives to cheat (financial and prestige compared to home-country alternatives), and lower barriers (knew each other well, and trusted in each another’s cultural assumption that anything goes).

In the ensuing 30 years, the U.S. in general has become more like those students.  Incentives are greater, because college is more expensive, income disparities are greater, and so your lifetime return on investment from attending a top-tier school is now much higher than that from a second-tier school.  Barriers are lower, because the Internet eases cheating, and because for a decade, high-profile corruption and fraud in the US has often gone unpunished or lightly punished (finance, banking, corporate governance), reinforcing a message that anything goes.

Until those things are corrected, clearly a school must police itself to preserve its reputation.  Sad but obvious.

It would sure help if employers would hire more intelligently.  When we fetishize a Caltech diploma, and rank it over skills, initiative and enthusiasm, we sustain the huge incentive for students to get that degree by hook or crook.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seems likely that there is an element that&#039;s not being mentioned in this story:

http://educationrealist.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/asian-immigrants-and-what-no-one-mentions-aloud/

&quot;The stereotype, delicately put: first and second generation Chinese, Korean, and Indian Americans, as well as nationals from these countries, often fail to embody the sterling academic credentials they include with their applications, and do not live up to the expectations these universities have for top tier students.

Less delicately put: They cheat. And when they don’t cheat, they game tests in a way utterly incomprehensible to the Western mind, leading to test scores with absolutely zero link to underlying ability. Or both. Or maybe it’s all cheating, and we just don’t know it. Either way, the resumes are functional fraud. &quot;]]></description>
