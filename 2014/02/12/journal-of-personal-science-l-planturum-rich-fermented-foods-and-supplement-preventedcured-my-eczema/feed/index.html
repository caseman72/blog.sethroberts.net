		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve now seen two dermatologists for scalp issues &amp; resultant bald patches, and have received two diagnoses, lichen planopilaris &amp; pseudopelade. Both diagnoses were made by looking at my head, rather than performing a biopsy. When I questioned the 2nd one about it, he said a biopsy wouldn&#039;t show anything, that it&#039;s an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; investigative method. They both gave me steroid prescriptions and freely admitted that it won&#039;t likely help. The 2nd one referred me to a 3rd who specializes in hair transplants. 

I find the whole thing vastly irritating. Doctors who write a quick prescription and send me on my way, doctors who treat symptoms instead of looking for underlying causes, doctors who do less research than I do. One of these docs is the assistant head of dermatology at the local university, so I had high hopes. When I got to his office I thought I had the wrong address, as the signs &amp; brochures on offer were all about lipo, dermabrasion, skin tightening procedures and looking youthful. It&#039;s no wonder there&#039;s so much interest in personal experimentation - the medical profession is failing it&#039;s responsibility. Oh well, they don&#039;t call it a practice for nothing!

I&#039;ve also ordered the Jarrow l. Plantarum product. I doubt this is an allergy but I don&#039;t see how it can hurt to try it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suffered from hand eczema for years during cold weather, and it has gotten a lot better since I started a whole foods diet that includes a lot of fermented foods.

I&#039;m not sure what specifically helped, but I drink a lot of kombucha and kefir.]]></description>
