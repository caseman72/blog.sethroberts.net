		<description><![CDATA[Mish, a financial blogger, has a very interesting (incredible, IMO, due to the borderline malpractice) &lt;a href=&quot;http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/12/cancer-free-i-beat-prostate-cancer-mish.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;first-hand account&lt;/a&gt; of his experience with prostate cancer.

Of course, an elevated PSA test is what precipitated the whole chain of events. Here&#039;s my favorite quote concerning the PSA tests because it shows how unscientific MD&#039;s really are in their thinking and understanding:
&lt;i&gt;I informed the oncologist that I was going to have a PSA test every month. He commented something along the lines of &quot;Why do you want to do that? Every six months is sufficient. The tests are not that reliable.&quot; That is not an exact quote, but is best as I can remember.

My thought - which I did not express - was &quot;What kind of mathematical silliness is that? The more unreliable a test is, the more tests one should take to weed out erroneous outlier results.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

It&#039;s a long piece but stays interesting and informative all the way to the end.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, I blogged about it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wouldn&#039;t be the first time a multi-million dollar study was ruined by lack of statistical knowledge.  The Women&#039;s Health Initiative writing group (which had a lengthy roster of people with initials following their names) responded to criticism with this sentence (among others):

&quot;The CIs, interpretable individually at a single point in time as having a 95% probability of including the true hazard ratio...&quot;  JAMA, December 11, 2002—Vol 288, No. 22 p2823

where CI is, of course, &quot;confidence interval&quot;.  As anyone who has taken a first course in statistics knows, the interval includes the population parameter or it doesn&#039;t.  The &quot;probability of including the true&quot; parameter is either 0 or 1.

That someone wrote this mistake into a draft is understandable; we all make mistakes.  That no one in the entire writing group picked up this freshman mistake is horrific.  The above article contains a link for the members of the writing group, but this link went inactive a long time ago (I wonder why!).

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;ve taken a first course in statistics. I find no fault with their description. I don&#039;t see why you say the probability of including the true parameter is either 0 or 1. You don&#039;t know what they meant? Or how a 95% confidence interval differs from a 50% confidence interval? I seem to be missing something.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
