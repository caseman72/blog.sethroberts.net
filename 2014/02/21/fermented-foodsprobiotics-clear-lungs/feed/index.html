		<description><![CDATA[A drizzle of that Manuka honey into the nose with the head laid back over the edge of the bed is all I use to heal the sinuses.   To avoid the risk of complication, I only do one nostril at a time.  Some burning and &#039;fright&#039; accompanied my first attempt, but was apparently mostly mental, but with asthmatics, it might be dangerous.

They stay clean for many months thereafter, although I do seem to have some weakness there (my father had many complications of the sinuses, so guess I inherited some of that memory).&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...swabbing my nose with the Jarrow v299 once a day...&quot; That&#039;s extremely interesting.
I used to have chronic sinus. Jerry Pournelle advised using a sinupulse to wash out the sinuses. I bought one and used it for a year frequently and after a while I rarely needed it. I still use it every now and then but it&#039;s made a tremendous difference. A netti pot would also work but I believe the pulsing helps. Over time I&#039;ve changed my washing liquid. Now I use a prepackaged salt baking soda mixture, then I add one teaspoon xylitol, 1/2 teaspoon of H2O2, and three drops of 2% Lugols solution.
  One thing about the Water kefir is it&#039;s cheap. A little sugar, water and maybe molasses. Lot cheaper than any supplement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sam,

I don&#039;t particularly like kimchi or kraut and I find Kombucha too expensive to drink on a regular basis.  I take the Jarrow v299 supplement twice a day.  I did it originally hoping it would do something about my Rosacea.  Then I noticed the dry skin on my feet cleared up, I stopped coughing up phlem all the time and my  gums stopped bleeding.  I tried the flax seed oil and fish oil for the gums for a few months and it seemed to help a little but they stubbornly remained sore and bleeding.  I&#039;ve had this problem since I was a child and the dentist told me it was because I wasn&#039;t brushing enough.  The were still telling me that last year.  

I have a follow up, because it didn&#039;t do anything to clear the chronic congestion in my nasal passages.  I read about someone that swabbed their nose with kimchi juice and cleared up chronic sinusitis.  I got to thinking that If I was ingesting Kimchi rather than swallowing a supplement, that the bacteria would be working into my sinuses and into my lungs as I breathed.  As an experiment, I started swabbing my nose with the Jarrow v299 once a day.  The change has been dramatic.  I&#039;m 4 days in and have had 4 morning where I could breathe through my nose when I woke up.  At most, I have one morning here or there where that happens. I&#039;ve also seen steady improvements in congestion in my nose.  Still too short to know for sure but I&#039;m thinking I&#039;m on to something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Forgot to add. I wonder if resistant starch in combination would help also. Particularly potato starch. Might help feed healthier microbes.

Here’s a couple of links to the guy who experimented with resistant starches.

		<description><![CDATA[Water kefir has many of the bacteria known to help immune function. I hate kraut. I hate sour foods. This might be an easier way to get what you need.

&quot;...L. brevis is one of the major Lactobacillus species found in tibicos grains (aka water kefir grains)...&quot;
