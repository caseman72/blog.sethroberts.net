		<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth, I think Kirk is remembering something from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance:
&quot;I&#039;m from the factory too,&quot; I say, &quot;and I know how instructions like this are put together. You go out on the assembly line with a tape recorder and the foreman sends you to talk to the guy he needs the least, the biggest goof-off he&#039;s got, and whatever he tells you--that&#039;s the instructions.&quot;

Something I&#039;d forgotten from the book was Pirsig&#039;s decision to stop grading his English students.  It turned into career suicide for him, though, as I recall. You weren&#039;t thinking of ZMM when you tried different approaches to teaching, Seth?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;ve never read that book. It sounds interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To add two cents, I thought this blog was about more than honey and sleep, and looking at self-testing and experimentation.

That being said, in an an effort to address some sleeping issues, I tried the honey approach for a couple of nights using raw honey. That woke me up in the early morning hours with heart burn/indigestion. To resolve that, I took a table spoon of 10% Greek yogurt and went back to bed.

Thought this may be worth adding to your database.

Keep up the blog variety.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. If bedtime honey causes you to wake up too early, I suggest you reduce the dose. Try cutting it in half.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[“This is great, but there’s nothing in this about honey and sleep and recovery. Isn’t that what this blog is about?“

The connection between Ton&#039;s work and this blog is that both Ton and I believe that people who are usually ignored or treated as passive recipients have a lot to contribute. Ton believes low-level retail employees are a powerful force that can be used for the good of everyone (customers, bosses, etc.) In health care, I believe that the rest of us -- people outside the health care system, non-experts, people usually considered by those inside the system to be passive recipients -- are a powerful force for better health. For example, the idea that bedtime honey can improve sleep came to me from someone outside the health care system. I am outside the health care system. In my teaching, same thing: I believe that students have untapped capabilities that will help them learn and help you teach them and make teaching much easier.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you take these two ideas together, people care more about status than success and people care more about the short term than the long term you get lot&#039;s of seemingly counterproductive strategies.

One interesting thing happened at Apple retail. The new person in charge cut labor costs at retail stores. Revenue per employee went down. So they realized quickly that low cost didn&#039;t mean more profit. http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444375104577593271505121602

So this might be a small experiment based on the the ideas in the book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Alex, I remember reading, many years ago, an answer to your question .  Don&#039;t remember the source.  As I recall, at the last minute somebody remembers that the product needs an instruction page.  This task is assigned to the least-competent, most unproductive worker in the area (engineering or from the production floor) because everybody else is busy doing real work.

Which explains the brilliance of Apple, Amazon, and insert-your-favorite-example.  Somebody at the top cares about everything.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And speaking of things that are not easy and that companies routinely do not do:  Why do so few companies try to make their products easy to use?  And I&#039;m not talking just about high-tech devices.  Last night, I assembled a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groupon.com/deals/gg-1-deluxe-cat-trees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cat tree&lt;/a&gt; that I had ordered through Groupon.  The instructions were not very clear.  They looked like they were composed &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;by&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; an engineer &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;for&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; other engineers (and, the print and drawings were quite small, making it difficult to read, even with my reading glasses on).  With only a minimal amount of effort, the instructions could have been made much more user-friendly.  I imagine that the manufacturer does all sorts of difficult things, from implementing employee health plans to buying &amp; maintaining industrial-grade woodworking equipment.  Why can&#039;t they expend more effort to make their product easier to assemble?]]></description>
