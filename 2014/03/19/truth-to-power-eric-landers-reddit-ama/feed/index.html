		<description><![CDATA[I find it hard to see why spirited youngsters would want to be ground in the sausage machine that eventually spits out tenured jacks-in-office.  Hell, you could be into your forties before you were able to tackle a project that you had chosen yourself for its intrinsic interest.

It&#039;s a far cry from the best science lab there&#039;s ever been, with Ernest Rutherford&#039;s bright young men at the Cavendish.

I&#039;m very proud of persuading my daughter not, Not, NOT to do a PhD.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: A very smart Berkeley grad student in biology told me she had decided to leave academia after seeing up close what professors had to do -- how hard they worked. She had entered grad school thinking she wanted to be a professor.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Question As an advisor to the President, what is being done or do you think will be done to increase the attractiveness of students finishing PhD programs in science?&quot;

Wear more makeup? Wear designer clothes? Yep, that ought to help.

Sorry, I couldn&#039;t resist. :)]]></description>
