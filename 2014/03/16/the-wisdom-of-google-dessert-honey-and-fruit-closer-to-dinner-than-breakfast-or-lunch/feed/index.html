		<description><![CDATA[I agree that the term &#039;dessert&#039; is associated with dinner/supper.  An alternative analysis would look at the number of &#039;defined&#039; breakfasts on the published menus of &#039;diners&#039; such as Dennys.  (Note: this is an American analysis.)  Glancing at the menu at dennys.com, I see 26 defined items in the Breakfast section (not including the last one, Breakfast Sides).  Some are sweet, some are not.  The sales figures probably aren&#039;t available, so one has to count simply by availability.  Without looking at actual ingredients (using the names), I count seven as being primarily sweet (such as the French Toast Slam).  But even those customers who order a non-sweet selection could spread jam on their bread and put sugar in their coffee.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; I cannot find a definition of dessert that includes “usually dinner” or something like that. That is not the meaning I learned.

I suggest getting a better dictionary. From the OED, first definition of &#039;dessert&#039;:

&gt; dessert
&gt; 
&gt; (dɪˈzɜːt) 
&gt; 
&gt; Also 7–8 desert, 8 des-, disart, 9 desert. 
&gt; 
&gt; [a. F. dessert (Estienne 1539) ‘removal of the dishes, dessert’, f. desservir to remove what has been served, to clear (the table), f. des-, L. dis- + servir to serve.] 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. a.1.a A course of fruit, sweetmeats, etc. served after a dinner or supper; ‘the last course at an entertainment’ (J.). 
&gt; 
&gt;    1600 W. Vaughan Direct. Health (1633) ii. ix. 54 Such eating, which the French call desert, is unnaturall.    1666 Pepys Diary 12 July, The dessert coming, with roses upon it, the Duchesse bid him try.    1708 W. King Cookery 261 &#039;Tis the dessert that graces all the feast.    1739 R. Bull tr. Dedekindus&#039; Grobianus 96 If the Guests may pocket the Desart.    1834 Lytton Pompeii iv. iii, The dessert or last course was already on the table.    1846 J. Baxter Libr. Pract. Agric. (ed. 4) II. 69 The Medlar‥when in a state of incipient decay is employed for the dessert.    1875 Jowett Plato (ed. 2) III. 696 Pleasant kinds of dessert, with which we amuse ourselves after dinner.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The quotations do not support the definition. They are consistent with &quot;after a meal&quot;.
&lt;/strong&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[another confounding factor, for some people dinner could be lunch... 

From wiki, 
&quot;Dinner usually refers to the most significant meal of the day, which can be the noon or the evening meal. 
However, the term &quot;dinner&quot; can have many different meanings depending on the culture; it may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day.[1][2] 
Historically, it referred to the first meal of the day, eaten around noon, and is still occasionally used for a noontime meal if it is a large or main meal. 
However, the meaning as the evening meal, generally the largest of the day, is becoming standard in the English-speaking world.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is the word &quot;dessert&quot;. The definition of that is something that comes after a meal, usually dinner.

Do a search for &quot;sweet&quot; and I am sure it will come up more associated with breakfast than dinner. As I said above, breakfast is often primarily sweet while dinner is always non-sweet + perhaps some sweet at the end. 

Sweet in the morning seems far more prevalent than the other way around. Also, afternoon snacks are often sweet as well. 

It would seem, then, that traditionally, while dessert would often follow lunch or dinner, those meals were always largely non-sweet, and sweet was far more associated with early morning and afternoon eating and that sweet was only a minor part of evening eating.]]></description>
