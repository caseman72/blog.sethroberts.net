		<description><![CDATA[More off-topic-- This place has a good commenting community, but with only the three most recent comments listed in recent comments, it&#039;s hard to know which threads are still active.

The best simple system I&#039;ve seen for keeping track of comments is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/&quot;Making Light&lt;/a&gt;-- give access to the last 1000/2000/4000 comments, and if you click on a comment in one of those lists, it changes color.

The best complicated system is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://amptoons.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alas, a Blog&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[O/T lesson from life: today I happened across an article in an old Telegraph.  On a brief visit to Washington D.C. a journalist decided to go and look at the White House.  This proved surprisingly difficult because everyone from whom she asked directions assured her that it was beyond walking distance.  When she got there she had, she said, covered a distance that most British people would consider a short stroll.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post. 

I like the description he gives of the state of mind one is in after being &quot;put in one&#039;s place&quot; by someone arrogant. It&#039;s not conducive to an open minded exploration of the facts. It&#039;s not a learning state of mind. At that point, you&#039;re just trying to save face in the group. Certainly, I have experienced this state of mind too many times. Not fun. 

But, it is the real world. There are always arrogant pricks out there. So, it is a great skill to be able to deal constructively with those types of people. But it&#039;s difficult. 

Some of these arrogant people are really skillful at evoking fear and anger. And it&#039;s a winning strategy for them because once you become fearful, you are no longer thinking as clearly, reasonably, honestly as you are when you&#039;re calm. 

I sometimes think it is their main rhetorical technique: make the other person fearful, angry, resentful, predominantly emotional, and then make them look really stupid in front of the group.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following-up on Nancy&#039;s off-topic post, I&#039;m reminded of the fact that some significant percentage of songs on Spotify have never been played -- ever.  There&#039;s a cool web app called &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/you-can-stream-those-4-million-spotify-songs-that-have-1512468463&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Forgotify&lt;/a&gt; that will randomly choose an unplayed song and play it for you.  I actually haven&#039;t used that app, but there&#039;s another, similar one called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karnhuset.net/demos/spotify/randomSong/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Spotify Random Song Generator&lt;/a&gt; that plays a totally random song (whether it&#039;s been played in the past or not).  I&#039;ve used it a number of times, and it&#039;s quite interesting the music it selects.]]></description>
