		<description><![CDATA[Ahoy Seth, Ben Goldacre seems to be admitting that his  study of statin side effects is on a par with much &quot;Climate Science&quot; i.e. it&#039;s twaddle based on lousy data.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

That magnesium study has precisely the same problems as the Willett studies that we had been discussing.  Look at Table 1.  Across the board, almost every indicator of health (except physical activity, but more on this below) increased monotonically across the magnesium quartiles.  The folks in the highest quartile were inherently healthier than those in the lower quartiles.  This inherent (i.e., unmeasured) difference cannot be adjusted for in statistical models.  Incomplete adjustment for &quot;potential confounders&quot; (or even &quot;known confounders&quot;) can just as easily increase the net confounding bias as reduce it.

Regarding the physical activity measure, I&#039;m skeptical.  They measured it in hours per day, and the averages ranged between 4.5 and 4.9 (hours per day!!) across the quartiles.  I&#039;d wouldn&#039;t put much weight on that one! 

I wouldn&#039;t use this study as a reason to start taking magnesium!]]></description>
