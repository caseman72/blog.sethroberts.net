		<description><![CDATA[Nancy, yes, I am worried (concerned would be a better word) about sugar, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;m overly concerned about it. &quot;Given its many links to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, etc.) And I think I said that one daily teaspoon is probably no big deal - for most people. But like with any addictive drug, self-limiting the daily dosage can be problematical.

I don&#039;t think Banting&#039;s research looked at exercise. But, yes, it certainly could be a confounding factor. I don&#039;t think it looked at lifespans (although T2D can usually be expected to knock off ~ 10 years, on average), or other aspects of the diets, or even things like vitamin D levels, for example. It was just one factor, but a pretty startling one, in my opinion. You might be interested in reading the book &quot;Sugar Blues&quot;, by William Duffy, just to name one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where&#039;s the high5-icon? I totally agree with you, Seth.  Sure too much sugar, probably like too much of anything is bad, but I find it really hard to believe that nature would evolve such an enduring love of the taste of sugar if it really was that &quot;toxic&quot;.  It just doesn&#039;t make any sense to me.  Plus, if I recall correctly, our brains (and pretty much our bodies) run on sugar.  

And I agree that nutritionists are not to be trusted. They have been wrong about a lot, like 180 wrong, so how are we ever supposed to trust anything they say? I have seen dietitians and nutritionists on tv say they make their recommendations based on the evidence, but honestly, at some point you have to wonder if they are really understanding what they are reading. It&#039;s like the whole field has no b.s. detectors at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, based on what you&#039;ve said, it sounds like you&#039;re overly worried about sugar. I agree that it&#039;s a bad idea to use it as a staple, but that doesn&#039;t mean there&#039;s a reason to avoid the teaspoon or even tablespoon of honey before bedtime.

There&#039;s at least one confounding factor in Banting&#039;s research-- amount of exercise. Also, do you have information about lifespans for workers vs. plantation owners?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth Says &quot;I found in an experiment that Vitamin D in the morning improved my sleep&quot;...

Hi Seth, 

on the Vit D subject, have you made any changes since you started your D3 supp routine...
ie. do you vary your dose at all, possibly depending on how you feel, or the season (sun exposure), etc

also, do you ever bother getting your Vit D blood levels tested (if so, what are/were your numbers &amp; do/did you adjust your D3 supp based on the result).

cheers

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No I haven&#039;t made any big changes. I will get my Vit D blood level measured soon.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stu: I don&#039;t really think that Lustig is overweight. He&#039;s got a little bit of padding, yes, but for someone his age, that&#039;s pretty normal. A BMI of 27-28 is the sweet spot (relative to longevity) for men his age. On the other hand, Lustig has said many times that&#039;s he&#039;s NOT a fan of low-carb (you can look it up). So those &quot;extra&quot; pounds you see may be due to eating too many carbs, too many calories, etc. And I agree with you. I don&#039;t think people should be avoiding fruit and vegetables. Quite the contrary. Refined sugar, yes. But fruits and veggies come with nutrients, fiber, etc. That is, they&#039;re real foods.

Nancy: On the assumption that we&#039;re talking refined sugar, here&#039;s what I think: One of the discoverers of insulin, Fred Banting, discovered that among sugar plantation owners who ate the refined version, diabetes was rampant. But among the native cane workers, who only got to chew the raw cane, there was no diabetes. Yes, it&#039;s only a simple observational study, but I think there is a strong message there. I just don&#039;t think that humans are able to deal with refined sugar. 

But do I think small amounts of sugar are dangerous to most people?  That would depend on what you mean by dangerous, and by small amounts. Do I think that a single teaspoon of sugar at bedtime is dangerous? No, not really. Not for most people. But do I think eating processed and refined foods all day, foods that are usually heavily laden with sugar, are dangerous? Absolutely. In fact, I think it&#039;s deadly. That&#039;s why I stick to real foods, foods that don&#039;t require an addictive drug (which means, by definition, that it&#039;s very hard to keep it to &quot;small amounts&quot;) be added to it to induce me to eat it.

I also think that too much sugar (of any variety) can seriously damage the endothelium, the lining of the arteries. Over time, that can lead to heart disease, diabetes, renal dysfunction, Lupus, etc. And the more damage, the more cholesterol that&#039;s needed to repair it. So you can see why I think that artificially lowering one&#039;s cholesterol level with statin drugs is counter productive. And dangerous.

It&#039;s just doesn&#039;t seem logical to me, in this age of obesity, diabetes, etc., why we would want to add something like refined sugar to our diets, knowing how addictive it is, without at least getting some actual nutrients and fiber in return. Our food stuffs today are already short of nutrients (thanks to modern farming techniques), then we often cook the remaining vitamins and minerals right out of them, so the part we actually consume often lacks any nutrients at all. So, to someone like me, it&#039;s just another lost opportunity to improve one&#039;s health.

That&#039;s probably more than you wanted to hear, but sometimes I just can&#039;t help myself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If sugar is so bad for your health and causes obesity then why is Robert Lustig (the guy leading the anti sugar movement) overweight? He also has a red face (malar flush), bags under his eyes, a swollen face and a thinning outer third of his eyebrows (and thinning eyebrows in general) which are all symptoms of hypothyroidism. A zero carbohydrate diet is know to contribute to thyroid problems and hypothyroidism. 

Don&#039;t believe me? Then just do a google image search.

I once had someone tell me that they were avoiding eating carrots and onions because of the sugar content which is ridiculous. 

Maybe refined sugar isn&#039;t ideal due to a lack of nutrients, but I don&#039;t think people should be avoiding fruit and vegetables because of sugar. The days where I have felt the best and slept well are often the days I eat the most fruit and sugary/starchy vegetables.]]></description>

One little interesting study that echos this sentiment found that the form a food took had vastly different impact.

See Kindke&#039;s post &quot;Powdered food ( carbs? ) appears to be very evil&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[@Joe the whole point of eating food is to get energy and refined sugar is great for that. All the nutrients you get from food are pretty damn useless without some &quot;empty calories&quot; ( yea I think saying empty calories is really stupid). I expect the &quot;experts&quot; to reverse course on their opinions of sugar. 

The &quot;experts&quot; opinion of fiber I think is pretty damn laughable also. I have very little fiber in my diet and yet somehow manage to have 3 quick bowel movements a day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt: &quot;That the observed results are so at odds with conventional wisdom are particularly interesting to me, and I’d guess to Seth as well.&#039;

But there is no conventional wisdom to be at odds with. Quite the contrary. Many, maybe most, experts would conclude that a little sugar (or other forms of carbohydrate) at bedtime, in and of itself, is relatively harmless, and may even improve sleep.

And even I would have to agree. On the other hand, why not totally eliminate the potential for damage (which isn&#039;t unsubstantial), by eating some real food, some real fiber, and get some real nutrients, and also improve his sleep? If improving Seth&#039;s health is his main objective (by getting better sleep), I fail to understand why he doesn&#039;t think more nutrients, fiber, etc. wouldn&#039;t be better at accomplishing that. 

And I&#039;m pretty sure that he&#039;ll be along shortly to explain that to me.  :)]]></description>
