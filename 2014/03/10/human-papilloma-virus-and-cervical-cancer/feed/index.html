They surely must already know by now that statins don&#039;t work by lowering cholesterol (and don&#039;t prolong life), yet here they are again, looking for yet another way to make money...er...lower cholesterol levels.

It couldn&#039;t be that most of the statin patents are running out...could it?

		<description><![CDATA[Jason:

&quot;Anyone with a good understanding of the logic of science would have a lot of questions before feeling confident connecting two events related only by proximity in time.&quot;

But they are not only related by proximity of time. Getting a shot, and then being hit by a car, might fit your description.  

But getting a vaccination, and then almost immediately (or soon after) suffer symptoms (e.g., seizures, strokes, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headaches, stomach pains, vomiting, muscle pain and weakness, joint pain, chest pains, hair loss, appetite loss, personality changes, insomnia, hand/leg tremors, arm/leg weakness, shortness of breath, heart problems, paralysis, itching, rashes, swelling, aching muscles, pelvic pain, nerve pain, menstrual cycle changes, fainting, swollen lymph nodes, night sweats, nausea, temporary vision/hearing loss, death, etc.) that could LOGICALLY be connected to having foreign proteins and chemicals injected into your body, would not.

No, it&#039;s not proof. Anymore than any other correlation can be considered proof, but it sure jumps out as something that demands more investigation before going too much further.

&quot;First, do no harm.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason:
&quot;Back to Joe… it really depends on how you define controversy, doesn’t it?&quot;

Absolutely. Definitions matter. The best example of that is found in the &quot;climate change&quot; field. The climate alarmists began to use the term after it became apparent that the globe hadn&#039;t warmed for over 17 years.  Another &quot;inconvenient truth&quot;?

&quot;Do I consider a few people whose arguments rely on willfully ignoring or misrepresenting evidence to be adequate to call something controversial? No, I guess I don’t.&quot; 

Jason, I think you need to expand your list of reading material. It&#039;s not a few people, it&#039;s from experts around the world. And if I thought they were misrepresenting the evidence, I wouldn&#039;t put any credence into their claims or their research.

&quot;At least as you’ve represented them, your arguments refuting the HPV-cancer link a) ignore much of the evidence base, perhaps intentionally;&quot;

What evidence base? You have only a correlation upon which to hang your hat. A correlation shared by the vast majority of the population (HPV infection). Of which only a tiny fraction ever get cervical cancer and die. And which can essentially be totally avoided by getting regular Pap smears. And you somehow think it makes sense to &quot;vaccinate&quot; virtually everyone on the planet, with a &quot;vaccination&quot; that&#039;s never been proven to protect against anything, and which may have already killed over 100 girls and harmed ~ 20,000 others. I think that&#039;s criminally stupid.

&quot;b) rely on theories that were flawed even when produced 100 years ago, long before the science behind much of the current evidence was even developed;&quot; 

What theory would that be, exactly? And what &quot;science&quot; is there behind the current evidence? That somehow correlation now means causation? When did that become science?

&quot;and c) don’t actually offer much of an argument beyond that you just don’t believe the existing evidence.&quot;

Oh, I believe the existing evidence. Unfortunately, the &quot;evidence&quot; consists of correlation, not causation. And anyone who&#039;s ever taken even Bio 101 knows that correlation isn&#039;t the same as causation. Your side wants to convict firemen for starting all those fires simply because firemen can be found at the scenes of most fires. My side demands more than that before we blame the firemen. Like real scientific (forensic) evidence.

&quot;To me, that’s not a controversy. Or at least, it’s not a scientific controversy. But people try to call the science in the question to back up political arguments that they know aren’t defensible purely on political grounds. 

As far as I&#039;m concerned (I can&#039;t speak for others here), this particular controversy isn&#039;t about political arguments. It isn&#039;t even about the subject of vaccinations in general. It&#039;s about the scientific method. It&#039;s about the wisdom of exposing millions of young women (and others) to the potential hazards (including death) of a vaccine that&#039;s never been scientifically proven to prevent any disease, including the disease the vaccine is purported to protect them against.  A disease that has historically affected only older women, and which takes the lives of only a tiny fraction of them, and even that tiny fraction can be protected by getting regular Pap smears. What ever happened to: &quot;First, do no harm&quot;?

&quot;On the statins question, you might be surprised.&quot;

Nothing surprises me anymore about the subject of statins. 

&quot;Purely in terms of evidence, there doesn’t seem to be much controversy that for primary prevention, statins aren’t very useful, and certainly aren’t justified based on the number needed to treat to prevent a cardiac event. &quot;

Yet one cannot visit a doctor anymore without being strongly urged to take a statin pill. Why? And just recently, the protocol has even been expanded to increase the target base by at least 40%. Why?

&quot;There’s controversy about whether or not to change current clinical recommendations, but again, that’s not really a scientific controversy. 

Here&#039;s the scientific controversy: Statins were sold to the public as an easy and safe way to lower one&#039;s cholesterol, right? Everyone knew that high cholesterol was a risk factor (i.e., correlation) for heart attacks, right? But wait, numerous studies have now shown us that just as many people with &quot;low&quot; cholesterol levels have heart attacks as those with &quot;high&quot; levels. And that there is essentially ZERO difference in overall mortality. Especially if one understands the difference between relative risk and absolute risk. So they better come up with an explanation for that, right, and quickly? So now they try to claim that for those with previous heart attacks, there is a barely measurable benefit. While they still try to push statins on all the rest of us! Why? Heck, once a person has reached the age of 65, those with higher cholesterol levels live longer than those with lower levels. That is, cholesterol appears to have a PROTECTIVE effect. So why in the heck would anyone want to artificially lower one&#039;s cholesterol? I just don&#039;t get it, and would you, if you could find a way to be honest with yourself.

There may be something about statins that protect a small fraction of us against heart attacks, but it isn&#039;t by lowering our cholesterol. That&#039;s a scientific fact. It may have a slight anti-inflammatory effect, and more and more scientists are now attributing CHD to inflammation, so statins have been pushed on the public (as a whole) for exactly no good scientific reason. All thanks to an incorrect CORRELATION.

Entire books have now been written about all the serious side effects of taking statin drugs (including death). Books such as &quot;The Statin Damage Crisis,&quot; by Duane Graveline, M.D., &quot;The Heart Revolution,&quot; by Killmer McNally, M.D., &quot;The Great Cholesterol Myth, by Stephen Sinatra, M.D., and Jonny Bowden, Ph.D., &quot;The Great Cholesterol Con,&quot; by Malcolm Kendrick, M.D., &quot;The Cholesterol Conspiracy,&quot; David R. Hastings Lloyd, &quot;You Will Not Die From A Heart Attack,&quot; by David S. Grimes, M.D., &quot;Ignore The Awkward,&quot; by Uffe Ravnskov, M.D., Ph.D., &quot;The Cholesterol Delusion,&quot; by Ernest N. Curtis, &quot;Low Cholesterol Leads To Early Death,&quot; by David Evans and Tom Naughton, &quot;The Truth About Statins,&quot; by Barbara H. Roberts, M.D., and many more.

I guarantee to you, Jason, if you read all those books, they will have to put a gun to your head to get you to swallow a statin pill.

[…]
&quot;I don’t object to a healthy skepticism about science. 

I have no skepticism about science.  I have a lot of skepticism about the people who claim to practice it. And far too many of them are dangerous to our lives. That&#039;s a scientific fact.

&quot;That science often turns out to be wrong is a feature, not a bug. What I do object to is the attempt to delegitimize scientific findings merely because they are inconvenient or unpalatable to a political or cultural viewpoint.

I see no one here who fits that description. I do see a lot of people who QUESTION those so-called scientific findings, which is what scientists are supposed to do, right? In fact, it&#039;s part of their job description!

And I object to the people who try to ridicule or belittle them for doing their jobs. For caring about their children. For questioning the &quot;experts.&quot; For doing their own due diligence.  And I think they should be roundly praised and congratulated.]]></description>

If someone dies within 72 hours of a vaccination any sane person would increase how much they fear vaccines unless there is a more plausible cause of death.

		<description><![CDATA[Briefly, on measles, in NZ, people born before 1969 are considered to be completely immune to measles.

Why?

Because the measles vaccine was introcuced somewhere around then.

That is, the first one, that was supposed to provide life-long immunity.

Except it didn’t.

So another one was introduced. A booster.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Briefly, on measles, in NZ, people born before 1969 are considered to be completely immune to measles.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the measles vaccine was introcuced somewhere around then.</p>
<p>That is, the first one, that was supposed to provide life-long immunity.</p>
<p>Except it didn’t.</p>
<p>So another one was introduced. A booster.</p>

Sorry, but puclic health authorities have set the agenda here with their focus on brain inflamation and dealth as “possible outcomes” when they are justifying their resource spend on vaccinating against mealsles. They cite absolute numbers of people infected, and numbers of people taken to hospital. They do not mention the percentage of those infected who are fully vaccinated (a varying yet significant percentage, and in my book a false sense of “security” is of particular concern) and that of those who visit hospital, as it would be very, very rare for these people to not be checked and sent on their way straight away.

I should concede that we are probably coming at this from different angles. Although chicken pox can be vaccinated against (at a cost, with scaremongering, and failure rate) we chose not to do this and instead our kids have all had chicken pox. Was it a hassle? Yes. Was it unpleasant and inconvenient? Yes. However, we have some confidence that their resulting immunity is robust, and the negative factors are really not that bad.

Chicken pox is referred to as a horrendous, scarring, terrible disease in media by those who are selling or promoting the vaccine. I find this unacceptable, but you might feel this is quite OK to mislead and scare people.

Concerning anecdotal evidence, of course it is difficult to establish causality. However, when a healthy 12 year-old girl feels immediately unwell immediately after a Gardasil injection, and goes downhill from there and dies, this indicates to me that as a parent I want to know significantly more about this. Nurses complain about Gardasil that most often the girl faints, breaks out in hives, etc. immediately following. This isn’t some random thing I read on the internet. I actually have had these conversations. Recently. I recognise your right to be concerned about the veracity of my claims, though.

My general position is that I really don’t think we know enough about the immune system, nor do we have enough data to make high-quality guesses.

Add this to obviously unhealthy amounts of power held by pharma companies and their consultants, the economics of big health, etc., and the overall picture isn’t a good one.

I think Seth’s post above does a better job of summarising the situation - apologies for the long-winded response.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think what irritates me about the whole vaccination debate is that medicine says it is now evidence based, but what it considers to be evidence depends on the political correctness of the belief. As a now grandparent I would like to see the RCTs which prove efficacy and safety of any vaccine given. But that data is not actually available. Just asking for it raises the hackles of any medical person who can&#039;t provide it. They say &quot;trust me&quot; and frankly I no longer do. Association is not causation and while medicine demands proper RCTs for any alternative medical treatment they are more than prepared to accept association when it comes to vaccines. 

What made me really cautious about the HPV vaccination outcomes is that the doctors in sexual health clinics were claiming reduction in cancer within two years of the vaccine&#039;s introduction and various groups of docs have made that claim at least annually since then. Anecdotal evidence isn&#039;t acceptable in the place of RCTs. I want to know that the RCTs have been done over a decade or more for both cancer outcomes and in relation to safety. Noone has been able to give them to me. And I want to compare the numbers who report severe side effects with those who report cervical cancers. Only then can I make an informed choice.]]></description>

Robin and Seth: When I say the cases don&#039;t hold up to scrutiny, I mean the evidence linking these reports doesn&#039;t rise above the level of coincidence. Not even to the level of association that Seth insists is inadequate to connect a pathogen to disease. (Talk about a double standard...)

As to Seth&#039;s other point, no, of course I wouldn&#039;t agree with such a broad statement about proof, and I don&#039;t think many people would. Anecdotes in and of themselves represent a pretty low level of evidence, but they are evidence. But an anecdotal case of a young woman who died within 72 hours of receiving a vaccine is not in and of itself evidence of harm from the vaccine and more than an anecdotal case of a young woman dying within 72 hours of having a bagel is proof of harm from the bagel. 

Back to Joe... it really depends on how you define controversy, doesn&#039;t it? Do I consider a few people whose arguments rely on willfully ignoring or misrepresenting evidence to be adequate to call something controversial? No, I guess I don&#039;t. At least as you&#039;ve represented them, your arguments refuting the HPV-cancer link a) ignore much of the evidence base, perhaps intentionally; b) rely on theories that were flawed even when produced 100 years ago, long before the science behind much of the current evidence was even developed; and c) don&#039;t actually offer much of an argument beyond that you just don&#039;t believe the existing evidence. To me, that&#039;s not a controversy. Or at least, it&#039;s not a scientific controversy. But people try to call the science in the question to back up political arguments that they know aren&#039;t defensible purely on political grounds. 

On the statins question, you might be surprised. Purely in terms of evidence, there doesn&#039;t seem to be much controversy that for primary prevention, statins aren&#039;t very useful, and certainly aren&#039;t justified based on the number needed to treat to prevent a cardiac event. There&#039;s controversy about whether or not to change current clinical recommendations, but again, that&#039;s not really a scientific controversy. It&#039;s a political one. (Side note for anyone reading who found this because of statins: the evidence in favor of statins is much stronger among persons who have already had a heart attack.)

I don&#039;t object to a healthy skepticism about science. That science often turns out to be wrong is a feature, not a bug. What I do object to is the attempt to delegitimize scientific findings merely because they are inconvenient or unpalatable to a political or cultural viewpoint.]]></description>

But getting a useless vaccination every few years, for perhaps the rest of their lives, a vaccination that may have already killed over 100 girls and harmed ~ 20,000 others, that&#039;s okay, eh?

As for your point about measles, you’re falling victim to a classic misdirection technique: focusing on mortality to the exclusion of all other harm from disease.”

The publicised cases DO hold up to scrutiny. Not all of us here are in the US and outside the US, for example in Denmark and New Zealand, there are cases of healthy young women reacting severely to Gardasil. To be clear: it is uncommon, but measles mortality is miniacule also.

Now, measles and other harm. What, exactly, are you talking about? Gambling, alcohol and tabacco are fully legal, contribute to GDP, raise significant amounts of tax, and result in massive, widespread harm to society that studies show is acute and enduring (alcoholics are a disaster for their immediate and extended families, and the relationships of the same people with others).

A life in perspective is about appropriate responses to risks.

What risk are you referring to that measles causes that is so devestating, that is worth the concern, cost, adverse reasctions, and risk of vaccine use where there is no long-term knowledge about it?

As for “misdirection technique”s, I think you are referring to the Straw Man fallacy, and if so I utterly reject this. The measles issues is directly relevant to this discission. However, YOU are referring generally to general health benefits of measles vaccinations.

What are you talking about?]]></description>

<p>&#8220;Robin: Nobody has mentioned it because the publicized cases don’t hold up to scrutiny. That doesn’t mean the vaccine is 100% of course. Nothing is.</p>
<p>As for your point about measles, you’re falling victim to a classic misdirection technique: focusing on mortality to the exclusion of all other harm from disease.”</p>
<p>The publicised cases DO hold up to scrutiny. Not all of us here are in the US and outside the US, for example in Denmark and New Zealand, there are cases of healthy young women reacting severely to Gardasil. To be clear: it is uncommon, but measles mortality is miniacule also.</p>
<p>Now, measles and other harm. What, exactly, are you talking about? Gambling, alcohol and tabacco are fully legal, contribute to GDP, raise significant amounts of tax, and result in massive, widespread harm to society that studies show is acute and enduring (alcoholics are a disaster for their immediate and extended families, and the relationships of the same people with others).</p>
<p>A life in perspective is about appropriate responses to risks.</p>
<p>What risk are you referring to that measles causes that is so devestating, that is worth the concern, cost, adverse reasctions, and risk of vaccine use where there is no long-term knowledge about it?</p>
<p>As for “misdirection technique”s, I think you are referring to the Straw Man fallacy, and if so I utterly reject this. The measles issues is directly relevant to this discission. However, YOU are referring generally to general health benefits of measles vaccinations.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Robin:

&quot;Nobody seems to have mentioned that the HPV vaccination has led to a small number of otherwise healthy young women/girls having severe reactions and either dying or ending up in a pretty bad state.

As a father of two young girls, I’m super-focused on knowing a hell of a lot more about so-called vaccinations before they go anywhere near my kids.&quot;

Good for you! Educate your girls, do your best to raise them to avoid recreational drugs, unhealthy lifestyles, etc., urge them to get regular Pap smears, and they&#039;ll have a greater chance of being struck down by lightening than by cervical cancer.]]></description>
