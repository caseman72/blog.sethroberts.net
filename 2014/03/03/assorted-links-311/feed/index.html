&quot;HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI)... HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women get it at some point in their lives.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, what part of &#039;The Centers for Disease Control has postulated that at least 80% of sexually active women will have evidence of an HPV infection by age 50 (CDC, 2004).&quot; are you failing to understand?
It&#039;s right after &quot;How many of us have HPV?&quot;

You can also google it yourself. 

Also, I don&#039;t need to ask anyone about &quot;sexually active.&quot; Common sense and seven decades of actual experience with women leads me to believe that they&#039;re essentially all sexually active at some point, if not their entire lives. I&#039;ve yet to meet one who wasn&#039;t. 

Note: I think you&#039;re just trying to pull my chain again, so absent a sensible comment on your part, I&#039;m done with this topic.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I fail to understand what they mean by &quot;sexually active&quot;. You equate &quot;sexually active women&quot; with all women. I don&#039;t. I&#039;m sure if they meant all women, they wouldn&#039;t have qualified the word &quot;women&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, what percentage of women (say, over the age of 14) do you think have never been sexually active?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You should ask those who used the term &quot;sexually active&quot; that question. I don&#039;t know what they meant by it. And you might want to read the links you cite in support of your claim of 80% HPV infection rate. This link -- which you sent me -- shows a HPV infection rate of about 25%.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, the CDC, WebMD, etc.

&quot;The Centers for Disease Control has postulated that at least 80% of sexually active women will have evidence of an HPV infection by age 50 (CDC, 2004).&quot;

http://blogs.webmd.com/womens-health/2011/03/hpv-a-perpetual-problem-or-brief-infection.html

http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/hpv.html

And YOUR argument would be stronger if the vast majority of women (~80%) were NOT infected by HPV by the age of 50.

And I would bet that the number is even higher. Maybe as high as 95%. So think about that. Only 5% (or 20%, pick your poison) of women with HPV infection ever get cervical cancer, and only a tiny fraction of them die from it. And we want to &quot;vaccinate&quot; everything that walks? Please. 

Actually, the extremely high rate of HPV infection (almost universal), along with the tiny fraction of women ever getting cervical cancer, should tell you that HPV couldn&#039;t possibly be the cause of cervical cancer.

And why it doesn&#039;t is a mystery to me.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. I think I see the reason for the discrepancy. You have confused sexually active women with all women.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. HPV (an STD) infection rates have probably always remained pretty steady, even when we weren&#039;t routinely testing for it.  

2. There was no HPV association with cervical cancer, because we weren&#039;t then looking for one.  

3. Now we know that by the age of 50, ~80%(!) of women will have been infected with HPV, and that all but a very tiny fraction of them will ever get cervical cancer, ~ the SAME tiny fraction of women who have historically gotten cervical cancer (older women).

4. To then jump to the conclusion that it must be those all-powerful HPV antibodies that are causing a tiny fraction of those women to get cervical cancer, and to begin &quot;vaccinating&quot; everything that moves, is the very definition of ANTI-science. 

5. Your belief in the mythical powers of viruses borders on the religious.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Where do you get 80%? The studies I&#039;ve seen say 20%-50%. For example, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18809145.
&lt;/strong&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, HOW does that graf suggest that I don&#039;t get it? 

And if Duesberg ever said that, I&#039;m sure he intended it to be an illustration that associations/correlations mean very little when it comes to PROVING the CAUSE of any disease, just as my firemen/fires example was trying to do. At best, a strong association/correlation is an invitation to perform more experiments, research, testing, etc.

By the age of 50, ~80% of women have been infected with HPV. So who comprised the &quot;other group&quot;? 

Moreover, for the sake of discussion, let&#039;s say that HPV infection was 70 times more common in the cervical cancer group than in &quot;the other&quot; group. What were all the other things in common (association/correlation) that the first group shared, compared to the second group? Things such as recreational drug use, promiscuity, alcoholism, smoking, impaired immune systems, obesity, family history, diet, other prescription drugs, age, etc.

Why jump to the conclusion that it must be the HPV?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You seem to believe that more sensitive testing for HPV -- revealing that HPV is more common than previous tests showed -- will increase the association between HPV and other things, such as cervical cancer. It won&#039;t.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is the comment that suggested you don&#039;t understand what association means:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reason the association is so strong is because of the now explosion in testing for ANTIBODIES to HPV. HPV is essentially a ubiquitous virus, i.e., most of us have antibodies to it. Just like EBV, HSV, etc. So the “association” is going to be strong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I forget Duesberg&#039;s exact comment. It was something like &quot;Everyone who eats tomato soup is going to die. Does that mean eating tomato soup causes death?&quot; He seemed to think that &quot;everyone who eats tomato soup is going to die&quot; = association between tomato soup and death. There is no association between eating tomato soup and death. People who eat tomato soup are no more or less likely to die than people who don&#039;t eat tomato soup.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:

&quot;I’d say the association is extremely strong. Evidence of causation: not so strong. Until this particular theory (“virtually all cervical cancer (90% +) results from certain strains of HPV”) is used to reduce cervical cancer — and such evidence is a long way off — I would not say the evidence is strong.&quot;

The reason the association is so strong is because of the now explosion in testing for ANTIBODIES to HPV. HPV is essentially a ubiquitous virus, i.e., most of us have antibodies to it. Just like EBV, HSV, etc. So the &quot;association&quot; is going to be strong. 

But as we should all know, antibodies don&#039;t cause diseases. They are merely a sign that our immune system is doing, or has done, it&#039;s job. 

Koch&#039;s Postulates were designed to test for causality, not association. Which is why the &quot;virus hunters&quot; (by ignoring Koch&#039;s Postulates) get away today with blaming so many diseases on relatively harmless viruses. All the better to sell more vaccines and drugs!

Seth:

&quot;I think you’re too sure that viruses don’t cause cancer.&quot;

I try never to be too sure of anything, Seth. I try my best to go where the facts, the science, and common sense, take me. And that&#039;s where it&#039;s taken me. 

Seth:

&quot;Until this particular theory (“virtually all cervical cancer (90% +) results from certain strains of HPV”) is used to reduce cervical cancer — and such evidence is a long way off — I would not say the evidence is strong.&quot;

That&#039;s precisely my point.  I would never endanger the health of a teenager (all vaccinations have consequences), for example, until it&#039;s proven that there is a reduction of cervical cancer in those who are &quot;vaccinated&quot; for HPV. (And even then, I&#039;d want to know by how much). Of course, that&#039;s why the &quot;virus hunters&quot; love &quot;slow&quot; viruses so much (tip:there are no slow viruses).

http://www.whale.to/vaccine/slow_viruses.html

They&#039;ll probably be long gone by the time the evidence is in. How convenient.

Note: Statin drugs, for example, reduce cholesterol.  But do they actually prolong life? Most studies say no. Statins come with serious, even fatal, side effects.

Whatever happened to: &quot;First, do no harm&quot;?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You seem to misunderstand what an association is. It is a correlation. Start with two groups of women: one has cervical cancer, the other doesn&#039;t. HPV 70 times more common in the first group than the second. Curiously Peter Duesberg had difficulty understanding this, too.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/slow_viruses.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whale.to/vaccine/slow_viruses.html</a></p>
<p>They&#8217;ll probably be long gone by the time the evidence is in. How convenient.</p>
<p>Note: Statin drugs, for example, reduce cholesterol.  But do they actually prolong life? Most studies say no. Statins come with serious, even fatal, side effects.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to: &#8220;First, do no harm&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>Seth: You seem to misunderstand what an association is. It is a correlation. Start with two groups of women: one has cervical cancer, the other doesn&#8217;t. HPV 70 times more common in the first group than the second. Curiously Peter Duesberg had difficulty understanding this, too.</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[There was a lot of press recently about the HPV vaccine guarding against cancer.

For example: http://www.webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/news/20140304/study-adds-to-evidence-that-hpv-vaccine-helps-guard-against-cervical-cancer

Except they did not show less cancer in women, they showed a reduction in &quot;abnormalities&quot;. They then go on to say &quot;the vaccine has a significant impact on the health of women&quot;, but has it? Depending on the abnormalities prevented, there might have been no symptoms, no negative impact to health, and no treatment needed. I&#039;m also curious if anyone knows if these abnormalities sometimes spontaneously resolve. What percentage of them will progress to cervical cancer? These are important things to know in order to judge the real impact on the health of women.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree. There is a big difference between what is claimed (less cancer) and what was measured (less abnormalities).&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, Seth, for not being more precise. Rous is a retrovirus (RNA), and a freak laboratory mutation.

And speaking of Duesberg, Rubin, and Temin...here&#039;s what they have to say about Rous:

http://books.google.com/books?id=pRWVZJKO0NsC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=duesberg+peyton+rous+virus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0ntyVgM3LP&amp;sig=c5mmUOaME7mhA10_E-WSZnCFbM8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JJoWU6PcEYSqkAeW6oHACw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=duesberg%20peyton%20rous%20virus&amp;f=false

For anyone who wishes to know more about viruses, retroviruses, cancer, and especially all the politics in science, I couldn&#039;t recommend this book more highly.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think you&#039;re too sure that viruses don&#039;t cause cancer. There is a very strong association between HPV and cervical cancer. The conventional explanation (it reflects causality) might be right. I don&#039;t think anyone has proven it is wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, thanks for your reply, but I don&#039;t appreciate the &quot;propaganda&quot; nor the &quot;misdirection&quot; comments. Your &quot;facts&quot; are wrong. Viruses don&#039;t cause cancer. Period. And there&#039;s ZERO scientific evidence that they do.

http://vactruth.com/2011/10/26/hpv-vaccine-cancer-repackaged-as-an-std/

http://www.rense.com/general78/hpv.htm

Now, if you still think that you&#039;re preventing your teenaged daughter from getting cervical cancer, by &quot;vaccinating&quot; her against a virus that couldn&#039;t possibly cause any kind of cancer, go right ahead. But no teenager of mine will ever be sacrificed on the altar of pseudoscience.

		<description><![CDATA[To get to your broader point, it seems like a stretch to suggest that the lack of broad public awareness of a vaccine-related industrial failure from nearly 60 years ago is strong evidence of pro-vaccine bias. 

But you&#039;re right that the information most people receive is pro-vaccination. But isn&#039;t it possible that this is because from a scientific and medical perspective, the anti-vaccine perspective is inherently weak? How else to explain that most anti-vaccine arguments rely on a combination of misdirection and outright falsehoods? 

Anti-vaccination views are as old as vaccination, and the political and economic arguments are very big. The scientific arguments are very small, because in most instances, the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I didn&#039;t say it was &quot;strong evidence&quot;. Just evidence. 

What I am doing, in a broad way, is saying: 

&quot;Here is information that opened my mind. I didn&#039;t know about it. Maybe you would like to know about it also.&quot;

In other words, I like to learn about complexities, facts that show things are not so simple. I assume readers of this blog are the same as me. You are simply saying, without any new facts, that things are so simple (&quot;in most cases, the benefits [of vaccines] greatly outweigh the risks&quot;). I fail to see the contribution.

What about my question: Who are some of these &quot;cautious experts&quot; you seem to believe are common? Here I am asking for new facts -- facts that might show my simple view of public health experts (they usually overstate their case) is wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I can&#039;t let Joe&#039;s comment go unaddressed. The evidence is extremely strong: virtually all cervical cancer (90% +) results from certain strains of HPV. HPV is also linked to several oral, anal, and penile cancers.

Again, this kind of propaganda relies on misdirection. Case in point: Joe&#039;s note that cervical cancer occurs mainly in older women, and that this is a reason not to vaccinate young women against high-risk strains of HPV. The progression from HPV to cervical cancer is a long one, typically occurring over 10-20 years, and sometimes longer. Of all HPV infections, only a tiny number can result in cancer. Of the women infected with those strains, only a tiny number will develop pre-cancerous cells. Of those women, only a tiny number will go on to develop cervical cancer. 

The older women who have cervical cancer today overwhelmingly have it because they were infected with certain strains of HPV when they were young women. 

Joe&#039;s free to believe what he wants. But it doesn&#039;t make it true.]]></description>

&quot;This reminds me of a UC Berkeley faculty member&quot;

That would probably be Peter Duesberg, and I agree with you, he knows more about viruses (and probably cancer, too) than almost anyone. Unfortunately, he&#039;s in the minority. The establishment has been successful in shutting his ideas down, to the detriment of millions of lives. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see him win the Nobel Prize one day, but it&#039;ll probably have to be posthumously.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, it wasn&#039;t Duesberg. The person I&#039;m thinking of is a little older than Duesberg. I forget his name.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
