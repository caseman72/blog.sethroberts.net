		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Seth: Szabo asked for help coding his ideas. No one disputes that.

That evidence has already been explained and screened off: he still needs that help. Interesting as Bitcoin is, if you&#039;ve read Szabo&#039;s papers (and not third-hand summaries), Bitcoin can still only be shoe-horned in as a very limited and partial implementation.

Incidentally, does that reply mean you concede all of my other points?

&gt; Finney is the author of the code.

Alphageek, have you compared the bitcoin-0.1.0 code to some of Finney&#039;s code like the RPOW server?

&gt; gwern, if Szabo could write C++ code, what do you think the probability is that you wouldnt have found any evidence of it?

I don&#039;t know. I have not finished looking into the matter to my own satisfaction. My point here is that ability to write C++ is the single most important piece of evidence in favor of being Satoshi, and yet, almost every Satoshi speculator ignores it or dismisses it in a sentence. I&#039;m reminded of http://lesswrong.com/lw/35d/inherited_improbabilities_transferring_the_burden/ and http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; This idea first surfaced a few months ago in an anonymous blog post based on textual analysis. Szabo used certain phrases in the original bitcoin description far more than a bunch of other possible candidates. That is real evidence.

No, it&#039;s bullplop. I criticized it at the time: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ruluz/satoshi_nakamoto_is_probably_nick_szabo/cdr2vgu

My criticism has been trapped in moderation since 1 December 2013. Oddly enough, the author has had time to approve 4 or 5 other comments, but *not* mine. I wonder why?

&gt; The original bitcoin postings appeared to come from the Eastern (United States) time zone.

You should check the timezone metadata on the SVN repo &amp; original whitepaper, and look at the location of the IPs in Finney&#039;s debug dump of the first Bitcoin transactions...

&gt; Szabo lives near Washington, D. C.

Really? The address I have for Szabo is in Minnesota. Just because he&#039;s affiliated with GWU doesn&#039;t mean he lives in DC.

&gt; Yet the original bitcoin proposal didn’t reference his work.

This also &#039;proves&#039; Wei Dai wrote Bitcoin, among others.

&gt; If he wasn’t the inventor of bitcoin, Szabo should have gleefully followed its progress, pointing out over and over how this showed his original ideas were right. He didn’t do this.

Most of the Cryptography mailing list thought it was a questionable idea at best, and Szabo has many projects, just look at his homepage.

&gt; Szabo’s achievement is good news for me because we have a similarity. He was a law professor.

He was a cryptopunk decades before he went into lawschool.

&gt; 5. The clincher, for me, is that he wrote an article about the emergence of money that is compatible with my theory of human evolution.

Once one has a theory, anything fits it. You are listing confirmatory evidence for Szabo, but where&#039;s your *disconfirmatory* evidence?

For example, the _Sunday Times_ just posted an article on Satoshi where Wei Dai pans the Szabo theory for the simple reason that no one has seen Szabo write C++ code, much less code dealing with cryptography &amp; IRC &amp; P2P networking. Coding is not a skill you pick up overnight! So, where is the evidence - any evidence - that Szabo knows C++? This is important. This is really really important, given that literally the only thing we know *for certain* about Satoshi is that he knows how to write C++ &amp; English. If one&#039;s favored candidate can&#039;t be shown to be an experienced C++ coder, that&#039;s a fatal problem for one&#039;s theory.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Szabo asked for help coding his ideas. No one disputes that.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
