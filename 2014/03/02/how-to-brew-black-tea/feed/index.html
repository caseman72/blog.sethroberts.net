		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Until recently, I made it the usual (Western) way. 1. Add hot water to tea. 2. Wait 3-4 minutes. 3. Add cream and sweetener. 4. Drink. 5. Throw away tea.

What tea expert did you learn this from? Was this endorsed by any tea textbook you read?

&gt; Now I do this: 1. Rinse tea with hot water, discard rinse water. 2. Add hot water. 3. Wait short time (e.g., 30 seconds). 4. Taste the results in a certain way. 5. Drink. 6. Reinfuse tea for longer time (e.g., 45 seconds). And so on.

This sounds similar to the Chinese gongfu style beloved of tea conoisseurs &amp; experts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea_ceremony#Brewing), dating back who knows how many centuries (but not as far back as the _Classic of Tea_, according to this paraphrase http://www.teanamu.com/2010/10/lu-yu-classic-of-tea-chapter-5/ ).

&gt; For many years, in other words, (a) I brewed it wrong then added cream and sweetener to fix my mistake and (b) due to poor feedback I had no idea what I was doing. Does that remind you of anything?

I dunno, this seems like a pretty clear cut case of laymen Doing It Wrong compared to the experts (when all your blog posts are trying to argue the opposite).

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I am unaware of any expert advocating Step #4. That is the important step.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I was a Chinese anthropologist at a Chinese university, I would find American food habits worthy of several  PhD candidatures, including new export products potential .
1.  A want to take a beverage and if it did not hit a conditioned  bliss point, add sugar until bliss point hit. If slightly astringent, add a mammalian calf food   until it tastes like mammalian  calf food.
2.  If taking tea , don&#039;t examine the thousand years of knowledge and the billion plus people that it has succoured, find what can generate a concern and cause FDA approval and quality control import permits to be established  and then create a patentable genetically modified plant  so that leaves have not one atom of  heavy metals .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A friend got kidney stones from drinking too much green tea. Though, he drank quite a lot. I think a pint or a quart a day, and no other water. Not sure how long they took to develop. He was a young guy, in his early-40&#039;s at the time, to have kidney stones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everyone always goes on about heavy metals in tea. I drank all kinds of tea for three and a half years, all day long almost every day. I was tested because one of my coworkers kept warning me and I started to get paranoid. Everything came back clean.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: thanks!&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, I don&#039;t drink coffee. I support adding butter to coffee, of course.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I’d be careful drinking any variety of tea. Tea has been proven to be anti-androgenic. I looked into this after realizing I wasn’t losing any weight despite drinking 3-4 cups of Japanese matcha. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3739374/

Also, any tea from China, organic or not, has been proven to have high levels of aluminum. Don’t have the time for the cite, but it’s out there. If you are going to drink green tea, make sure its from Japan. Adding some tamarind to the tea will reduce the fluoride. However, with the radiation accident ove there I’m not sure I’d even drink Japanese green tea now.

I switched over from drinking green tea to yerba mate. As far as I can tell, mate doesn’t have the high levels of aluminum, fluoride, and lead that green tea has. Perhaps its because mate is cultivated in south america. Here is a good white paper on yerba mate: http://amambay.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Heck-Mejia-Yerba-Mate-Tea.pdf]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be careful drinking a lot of tea.  Tea contains heavy metals that can accumulate to high amounts given how easy it is to drink large quantities of tea.

See here and keep in mind the clearance time of heavy metals can be a month+: http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jt/2013/370460/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[years ago i read that it is unhealthy to steep tea for longer than 4 minutes because of the increase in oxalates, which can produce kidney stones.  i couldn&#039;t  find anything directly on point, but there a ncbi article, here http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23532418, Effect of different brewing times on soluble oxalate content of loose-packed black teas and tea bags.

in addition, one article claims that &quot;the majority of flavonoids (the health benefits of tea) are infused from the tealeaves to the brewed tea after about 4 minutes of brewing.&quot; it also mentions the potential of kidney stone from oxalates. http://toxicfoodie.org/tag/black-tea/

i suppose if i looked longer i&#039;d find more, but i can&#039;s spare the time right now.

i rinse my green tea once to reduce the acidity (rinsing it reduces the number of P-H drops i add to the tea) , but try to brew it for no more than 4 minutes.]]></description>
