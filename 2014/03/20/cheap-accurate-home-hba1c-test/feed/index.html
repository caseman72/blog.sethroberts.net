		<description><![CDATA[Seth, perhaps clarify this sentence:
&quot;People get diabetes who don’t smoke and aren’t fat. &quot;

I couldn&#039;t parse it.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Some diabetics (a) aren&#039;t fat and (b) don&#039;t smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, this may be another example of how associations/correlations can lead us astray. What if smoking per se has nothing to do with getting diabetes?  What if obesity per se has nothing to do with getting diabetes?  After all, most smokers and most obese people do not have diabetes, right?

&quot;As a young surgeon, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.&quot;

What do many smokers and many obese people have in common besides diabetes? What do the smokers and obese people without diabetes have in common? Etc.]]></description>
