		<description><![CDATA[George, there&#039;s a lot of truth to the saying &quot;chance favors the prepared mind&quot;. Chance favors the prepared mind (often full of theories) in two ways:

1. the &quot;prepared&quot; person is more likely to do the thing that leads to the chance observation. As Zach says, the germ theory of disease is the reason Fleming was studying bacteria in vitro.

2. the &quot;prepared&quot; person is more likely to see how the chance observation can be used. In Paris, I suddenly lost my appetite. A chance observation. This had nothing to with any preparation or theory. But what happened after that did: based on my theory of weight control, I came up with an explanation of my loss of appetite. Then I tested my explanation. The results led to the Shangri-La Diet. Surely lots of people have had a sudden loss of appetite for reasons similar to mine. But, because of my &quot;preparation&quot; (my theory of weight control), I seem to be the only person to have learned from it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[George - You need the germ theory of disease in order to recognize that staphylococcus has anything to do with getting sick. Otherwise no one would have been interested in learning how to kill bacteria. There&#039;s a big difference between directed research in general and the sort of studies in particular that you are complaining about. Tinkering doesn&#039;t exist without some over-arching principle leading up to it (correct or not).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, noticing that some substances make you better or worse does not require any germ theory. Man has been doing that since the dawn of time. Had Fleming had all sorts of theories about what a bacteria is and how one might go about killing it he would not have had as much success in a hundred years as one chance event.

&quot;....Antibiotics transformed medicine. The discovery of antibiotics began by accident. On the morning of September 3rd, 1928, Professor Alexander Fleming was having a clear up of his cluttered laboratory. Fleming was sorting through a number of glass plates which had previously been coated with staphyloccus bacteria as part of research Fleming was doing. One of the plates had mould on it. The mould was in the shape of a ring and the area around the ring seemed to be free of the bacteria staphyloccus. The mould was penicillium notatum. Fleming had a life long interest in ways of killing off bacteria and he concluded that the bacteria on the plate around the ring had been killed off by some substance that had come from the mould.&quot;

&quot;Many of us have been taught that depression arises, in part, from chemical imbalances in the brain. Apparently, there is no evidence to support that. &quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Gina, not true at all. Many of the most important breakthroughs in medicine occurred not through directed research but completely by chance or as a byproduct of searching for something else entirely. Antibiotics, probably the biggest saver of lives ever, was a complete chance discovery. In fact, since the switch to large scale directed research, breakthroughs have become far fewer. Theories in fact come after you observe something works. In this case, oh I noticed sleep cures depression now let me invent a theory for that. The theory never would have existed without the prior observation, and plays no important role. 

There is a whole tradition of empirical medicine that doesn&#039;t rely on theory but relies on tinkering and serendipity. Directed research has some successes but overall a worse track record. This is surprising but true. We overvalue theory.

Seth - maybe your theory is right, but it seems unlikely that we didn&#039;t evolve to handle regular disruptions in sleep and to go without sleep periodically. In any event if sleep does in fact cure depression then your theory may or may not be right who knows.]]></description>

In your quest for the perfect night&#039;s sleep, have you tried nonalcoholic beer?  It raises GABA.  I&#039;ve been drinking one an hour before bed and it seems to help.

		<description><![CDATA[Why does it matter that we have a theory to explain depression? We need a cure for depression. If sleep works, great (although I doubt its important). I&#039;ve actually heard that sleep deprivation is helpful for depression, but whatever. I am resistant to any theory that posits the human organism to be incredibly delicate and only capable of thriving in a narrow set of conditions. I think that&#039;s clearly wrong. If you tell me we&#039;re obese or unhealthy because ooops, vegetable oils! I&#039;m gonna laugh. We&#039;re not that delicate. If depression is caused by imbalances in sleep, when we evolved in an environment rife with nighttime hunters and menaces and raids, I&#039;m gonna say, no, its unlikely we&#039;re such delicate creatures that not getting our 8 hours is gonna hurt us so much.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: My theory says we have a circadian oscillator that controls both mood and sleep. That oscillator needs certain input to function correctly. Just like we need Vitamin C for other things to work correctly. My theory suggests new treatments for depression.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
