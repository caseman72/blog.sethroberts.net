		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;ll throw in BigGov, too, for things like &quot;The Food Pyramid,&quot; &quot;The Food Plate,&quot; &quot;You can keep your insurance company. Period.&quot;, mass &quot;swine flu&quot; vaccinations, &quot;global warming&quot; hysteria, etc.

Trudeau should have an awful lot of company in the dock, no?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe has a very good point - we have had Trudeau&#039;s case plastered across the Chicago newspapers recently.  Part of the problem is that Big Medicine and BigPharma has everyone convinced, from most of the doctors on down through nurses and to the average citizen that things like stents and drugs save lives.  And most people, if told that they need one of these things, are too frightened to say no or even ask questions about alternatives because they are convinced they are going to die without them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best-selling author Kevin Trudeau jailed for TEN YEARS as judge calls him an &#039;uncontrollable huckster&#039; for selling fake weight loss tips
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2582977/TV-pitchman-Kevin-Trudeau-gets-10-year-sentence.html

Question: What&#039;s the difference between what Trudeau does and what a lot of BigMedicine and BigPharma do today? Stents (and other procedures, like tonsillectomies, Caesarian deliveries, etc.) that aren&#039;t needed (or that actually cause harm), drugs that aren&#039;t needed (or that actually cause harm), etc.

I&#039;m not aware of anyone losing his life because of Trudeau&#039;s false claims. The same can&#039;t be said of BigPharma and BigMedicine.

They all defraud and con the public, but only Trudeau goes to prison?  :(

PS: Yes, I know the real reason is that Trudeau violated several court orders, but you know what I&#039;m talking about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s just the tip of the iceberg. Stents now comprise ~ 85% of coronary interventions. Drug-coated stents cause even more blood clots than the non-coated ones, but, of course, bring in even more money for the hospital. 

For the past 15 years or so (after all this expensive intervention), heart attack rates have remained relatively constant.

First, do no harm?

Nah.

First, let&#039;s make some money.]]></description>
