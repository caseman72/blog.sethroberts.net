		<description><![CDATA[Jack, constipation is a complicated matter. But the amount of fiber you eat may, or may not, be a contributing factor. 

&quot;Stopping or reducing dietary fiber intake reduces constipation and its associated symptoms&quot;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/

Things like lack of exercise, taking certain medications, not drinking enough water, not eating enough fat, etc., all can contribute to it. Eskimos eat almost zero fiber and they have little to no constipation. People who are forced to eat liquid diets for weeks and longer can still have regular bowel movements. Etc.

I always try to &quot;have my cake and eat it,&quot; whenever I can, and I eat a good amount of veggies and fruits (along with animals and fish), mostly for the nutrients, but also for the fiber. And it all goes through me like you-know-what goes through a goose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In all fairness, I would have liked to see an article named “10 reasons to avoid meat” right along side of the article “10 reasons to avoid grains”. No doubt more people who do not get enough grains and fiber are having medical problems because they are constipated, which impairs the circulation of their blood and energy, which may lead to cerebrovascular disease and other problems.

		<description><![CDATA[IMO: Too small of a study to garner much information. Too much information was missing or excluded, etc. And it&#039;s about the only study I&#039;ve ever read that posits there&#039;s no benefit to eating whole grains and unrefined starches over their refined counterparts. (Someone should alert the authorities!) It&#039;s hard to tell how they even controlled for that. I also wonder what they mean by &quot;clinical coronary heart disease&quot;?  And using death notices for cause of death is notoriously unreliable. &quot;Heart disease&quot; is usually the go-to, absent an obvious gun-shot wound, blunt force trauma, etc. It also turns on its head, the current conventional wisdom, which is that low trigs, high HDL, and large LDL particles are protective. Grains (and too many carbs) cause trigs to go up, HDL to drop, and LDL particle size to become small and dense (all the better to attack your endothelium). Ditto for sugar.

And, of course, they didn&#039;t even have a &quot;no grains&quot; arm. That would have been interesting, I think.

It&#039;s also interesting to note, however, that saturated fat is NOT implicated. Huzzah! And that it&#039;s better to be short than tall. I can&#039;t do much about the latter, but I&#039;m sticking to my game plan: Eat saturated fat, veggies, fruit, and don&#039;t eat grains or sugar.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that lots of paleo people ignore the importance of plant fibre.  A couple of things that I think might be important.  You might be able to get that fibre from other sources but these just weren&#039;t measured properly.  My friend from Lao eats far more whole food than I do and I&#039;ve wondered if my western take of throwing out parts of our food might reduce our fibre intake.  He doesn&#039;t throw the apple core away, he eats it.  When he eats chicken wings and ribs, he cleans the bones more than anyone I&#039;ve ever seen.  I saw a study that found animal fibre being close to scFos in terms of helping pass probiotics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are still parts of Scotland where people eat lots of oats (porridge, oat cakes), eat lots of fish, and take plenty of exercise.  I&#039;ve never seen any suggestion that they are exempt from the high rate of heart deaths in Scotland.  But maybe they are.

(Decades ago my wife attended a seminar on heart attack rates in Glasgow.  The figures differed strikingly from one apparently identical neighbourhood to another, where a &quot;neighbourhood&quot; was tiny - just a few streets.  The investigator had no explanation to offer.)
