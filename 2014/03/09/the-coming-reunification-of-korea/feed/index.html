		<description><![CDATA[Are we talking about NK taking over SK -- because I&#039;m finding it hard to imagine NK leadership rolling over and letting SK leadership have any new influence or power. At all. Why would the NK leadership allow any change that would lessen their own power? 

Also, there&#039;s the American troops in the DMZ -- Washington would certainly have something to say about such a reunification. And what about Beijing? 

It&#039;s all so complicated. How will all of these participants come to terms?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brandon: the SK censorship is aimed at NK propaganda. This is not as stupid as it sounds for two reasons:

1. NK was actually wealthier and better off than SK early on, immediately after the Korean War, where they were being subsidized by China/Russia and were busy industrializing (NK has all the mineral resources and great stuff you want for industrialization which would make unification so valuable (http://www.nkeconwatch.com/nk-uploads/global_economics_paper_no_188_final.pdf), while SK has the agriculture; as well, Communist regimes have always been pretty OK at industrialization; see &quot;The Myth of Asia&#039;s Miracle&quot; http://web.archive.org/web/20090302203414/http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/myth.html). Unsurprisingly, the military dictatorship did not necessarily want NK materials around.
2. Some South Koreans are crazily, bizarrely, delusional about NK. You have no idea how many sympathizers there already are there, and how many spies NK has had working for it willingly over the years. To us, NK seems about as appealing as working for Sauron, but to many South Koreans, it&#039;s apparently a fine idea. To give you an idea of what I mean, one of their congressmen was convicted a month ago or so after the intelligence agencies recorded him discussing how to best overthrow the SK government and welcome in NK, where to store their gun caches which bases and power stations were best to sabotage, etc. Can you imagine an American representative being put on trial for planning landing locations for Spetsnaz? It wouldn&#039;t&#039;ve been plausible in the heart of the Cold War, much less now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;After she sent the email, she remembered that in South Korea it was illegal to cut-and-paste from a website.&lt;/i&gt;

Are you sure about that? I&#039;m having trouble confirming this.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, I&#039;m sure that&#039;s what she said.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
