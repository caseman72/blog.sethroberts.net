What&#039;s hard to determine is exactly what helped, if at all.

That indeterminable thing Is the only thing that would help another patient]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the link to the page by the guy who is a speed reader with cancer. 

It&#039;s interesting that this particular guy did _not_ say &quot;I&#039;m a speed reader, therefore I went on the internet and tried to find a bunch of web pages to speed read.&quot; 

Instead, he said: &quot;I have the ability to speed read very technical material, so I went to the library at Duke and read over 800 papers on melanoma ... &quot; 

It&#039;s really interesting that he found a promising new (to him and his doctors) idea for his own therapy.

It&#039;s also extremely interesting that there are comments on that page where people talk about their own success stories fighting cancer, despite their doctor&#039;s gloomy prognosis. 

In addition, there is this: &quot;...in Latvia, Melanoma is treated by virotherapy drug name Rigvir. Basically you ingest a virus that is deadly to melanoma but harmless to humans.&quot; 

There are articles about Rigvir and Oncolytic Viruses on Wikipedia. 

Also, here are some resources described (but not necessarily available online) by the UCLA library catalog.
