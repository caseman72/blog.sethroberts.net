		<description><![CDATA[Sidney, the blog post you linked to doesn&#039;t claim Alice Walton was DUI when she drove over a bystander. 

As for the main post, it is common knowledge that a large fraction of athletes can&#039;t read and do not belong in the classrooms of colleges and universities. It&#039;s an open secret. It&#039;s only inappopriate to notice if you suggest it&#039;s a bad thing. It&#039;s also an open secret that athletes are offered &quot;made up classes&quot; like underwater basketweaving, and it&#039;s been one since the 60s at least.

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s further interesting about the above article is that in its original form, it was built around misquoting Kennedy, and is essentially prima facie evidence of libel.  

So, possibly after being contacted by Kennedy&#039;s lawyers, they inserted the italicized sections, which correctly describe what Kennedy said, putting the lie to the rest of the article.

That makes one wonder about every &quot;shocking&quot; article in the paper that ISN&#039;T about someone wealthy enough to put muscle behind a libel complaint.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;An important detail is that Willingham, who is wealthy, did not need the job. She was free to say whatever she wanted.&quot;

This is a key point, yet it is rarely made. I&#039;m not sure why.  For the last several years, the myth that poor people have the same freedoms as the rich has been pushed hard, despite its obvious falsity.

Kerry Kennedy could afford to hire attorneys to fight DUI charges, so she did and she won. Yet almost no members of the public can finance a legal defense. Their actual innocence is irrelevant.

So prosecutors can file unwinnable cases left and right, knowing that only the 1% can afford to contest them. In Kennedy&#039;s case, the prosecutor was handed a well-publicized loss.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s always lovely to see someone with financial independence actually use it to do something for the rest of society, rather than just bleating about fashionable causes.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree. How much charity money is wasted because the people giving the money know essentially nothing about the people they are supposedly helping? &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
