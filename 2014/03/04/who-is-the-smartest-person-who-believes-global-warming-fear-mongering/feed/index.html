		<description><![CDATA[I would put it like this: Lots of societies get stuck doing the same thing over and over. They fail to innovate. They overuse this or that resource and, when it runs out, they die. 

For all I know, a misguided belief in AGW may cause valuable innovation. Perhaps that&#039;s why we humans are so credulous -- so we will innovate and explore more. Fake crises help us survive real crises.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do notice that the folks buying into climate change tend to be on the higher side of the mean IQ.  

I myself don&#039;t buy the androgenic thing, although pollution is real and controllable with will and money.

There is another take I have.  I have been reading Joseph Tainter on &quot;The Collapse of Complex Societies&quot;.  It was written in 1988 but is selling better now than when released.  Anyway, Tainter was looking for a more cohesive framework for understanding why complex cultures and societies have collapsed through the ages ( and there have been a lot of them).

The big idea is that societies and civilizations start out simply.  The entire purpose of a civilization is to hoover out materials and energy from the environment and distribute the goodies to members of the society.  As challenges present themselves (weather changes, running out of game or resources, threat from other societies, disease) the society must rise to a new level of complexity to deal with the threat and survive.  As years pass and challenges are met, complexity increases to an unsustainable point.  The society becomes less able to deal with threats or change because of vastly diminished returns on increased use of energy, materials and information flow (administration and vested interests).

So, after all that, I believe many of the intellegensia in western culture intuit (but don&#039;t articulate) that our own civilization may be way down the path where sustainability of resource and energy use is questionable.  This, in spite of stunning technological progress (high complexity). 

So.....maybe the collective consciousness is saying &quot;let&#039;s slow down a bit&quot;.  How to do this?  Well use less energy and resources for one thing.  Yeah, maybe WE have enough for now and don&#039;t need so much growth for now.  And - the emerging nations should stop demanding their share of the pie too.  So let&#039;s keep them where they are by halting use of the good stuff like oil.  Let them have, maybe, solar or wind.

So, I believe, we may be seeing the climate change movement as class warfare fought on a different front.  The &quot;science&quot; is almost irrelevant.  The beliefs will follow the unconscious imperative that western culture needs to buy time while figuring out a way to &quot;complexify&quot; even further.  The third world is going to get screwed.]]></description>

He&#039;s at the University of Washington and works on weather, not climate.  He has stated in the past that he believes global warming is happening (but the obvious effects won&#039;t happen for quite some time, as they are currently swamped by short term variability).   That said, he on several occasions posted criticism of the the way climate change issues are presented by both scientists and  the media. In particular he has argued against the extreme and/or overly precise claims of possible futures (especially in light of poor predictions so far), the hype of current weather as climate change driven, and general fear mongering (not all of which are addressed in this most recent post on the subject).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dragen, it all depends on how the question is asked. Virtually no one disputes that the climate is changing. It has always changed; it will always change.

But most of us believe that man can&#039;t, and hasn&#039;t, had much (if any) effect on it. And that there&#039;s nothing that can be done about it anyway, except to ADAPT to the changes as they happen. This has essentially been the case since the beginning of time.

The CAGW (catastrophic man-caused global warming) crowd (Al Gore, James Hanson, Michael Mann, and all the other Chicken Littles), enjoy running around and screaming that &quot;The sky is falling!&quot; and hope that they can use this scare tactic to raise our taxes, make money off of carbon futures, or fund phony &quot;green&quot; energy projects for their cronies, etc.

It&#039;s an ANTI-science scam.  Please don&#039;t buy into it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds a bit like Cialdini&#039;s bystander effect, but it also reminds me of ideological immunity, intelligence correlated with closed-mindedness to new information. I have no idea if it&#039;s a real thing, but it seems plausible.

All of the smartest people I know believe in climate change. They tend to be well educated, skeptics, liberal, feminist, and artists. And probably eccentric to those outside our cultural bubble, which is difficult for me to analyze objectively. A couple of them write publicly--maybe you can discern some commonality like what you have in mind:

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;One example is that tearing out trees and plants and replacing them with concrete and pavement will make an area hotter in the summer – Atlanta comes to mind. And if man can do it in a metropolitan area, I don’t see it as a stretch that he can affect larger areas too.&quot;

Exactly. But that doesn&#039;t affect our climate. It affects the temperature is a very, very small area.

&quot;E.g., if your thermometer reads two degrees too high, you can still use it to determine if the temperature is going up, down, or staying the same.&quot;

But how do they know if the thermometer reads &quot;too high&quot;?  Or &quot;too low,&quot; for that matter? Compared to what? There is no gold standard, so all temperature station results are highly suspect.

But, again, this has very little, to nothing, to do with climate. It has to do with the temperature of a very, very small patch of ground. Ground that is affected in many ways by changing nearby development, weather (weather is not the same as climate), etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seth: I wasn’t trying to convince anyone that the “humans are dangerously warming the planet” idea is wrong. I take that for granted. The post is about human nature, not climate change.&quot;

Sure, but how can you even start to evaluate your human nature hypothesis when you &quot;take for granted&quot; the metric by which you evaluate the hypothesis?  Is there any good way to move past a couple of anecdotes and some supposition here and actually improve the way that we learn, model, communicate, and do science?  Or are we doomed to have everything be dominated by badly handled data teased to tell the wrong stories?

		<description><![CDATA[Re the pause:  http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21598610-slowdown-rising-temperatures-over-past-15-years-goes-being

The explanation is a combination of a) the ocean, b) changes in the solar cycle, c) aerosols.

As for a smart guy that believes in global warming, Neil deGrasse Tyson is a pretty good candidate.

Not that it seems to matter. As others on this thread have indicated, both sides are so dug in that very few opinions are going to change anytime soon. What would it take to change your mind Seth? I&#039;m genuinely curious as I really admire many of the things that you have done on your blog. Are there any possible set of experiments, measurements, models, etc. that would change your mind?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

The most recent explanation I have seen for the &quot;pause&quot; in global warming is that there is indeed more thermal energy but it is going into the oceans.  So it doesn&#039;t show up as a rise in air temperature.  However, at some point it will and air temperatures may rise quickly.

You&#039;re right that none of the models predicted the &quot;pause.&quot;  Various people are now trying to change various models to incorporate it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, 

To determine if average temperature is increasing, decreasing, or staying pretty much the same, you don&#039;t have to have perfect measurements.  You just have to have measurements that are taken the same way, and combined the same way, over time.  You can be pretty precise, even if you&#039;re not accurate.

E.g., if your thermometer reads two degrees too high, you can still use it to determine if the temperature is going up, down, or staying the same.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There isn&#039;t &quot;Global Warming&quot; because the glaciers are melting to keep the temperature stable. When all the glaciers melt, then there will be &quot;Global Warming&quot;. Also, the amount of CO2 is at a all time high - due to many things - one of them being the big rain forests are not-so-big anymore...

I would recommend watching &quot;Chasing Ice&quot; with the realization that all the energy it takes to melt ice keeps the temperature constant. For example: if you have a cup of ice water - the water is 32F until all the ice melts - once all the ice melts then the water will heat up to room temperature. Note that the water is &#039;cold&#039; until all the ice is gone...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth asked: &quot;who is the smartest person you know who believes global warming fear-mongering? Does that person do other extreme or unusual things?&quot;

OK. Rather than people I &quot;know of&quot; like Tim Cook of Apple, I will answer this with someone I know personally, whose intelligence I have been able to gauge over many years. 

My &quot;smartest person...who believes in global warming fear-mongering&quot; is an Ivy League educated engineer.

&quot;Does that person do other extreme or unusual things?&quot;

He is extremely religious and active in his church and in church politics at a national level. 

I would describe him as a leftwing extremist in politics generally.

He is a guy who, when he has a strong opinion about something,is unpleasant toward those who disagree with him. He is intolerant toward opposing viewpoints on topics he&#039;s passionate about.

In his field of work, with which I have been involved at times, he is extremely good.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s really interesting. I don&#039;t know anyone who is extremely religious. At the heart of cooperation is shared beliefs -- a shared belief that what you are doing together is a good idea. If your shared beliefs (your religion) are too strong, too all encompassing, you&#039;ll believe too many things that are wrong and will fail to be persuaded by evidence. But if your shared beliefs are too weak or too few you will be impossible to work with.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is very dangerous to paint large groups of people with a single brush because it is easy to find bad apples in any large group and then to use those bad apples as the basis of your comparison. E.g. there are lots of examples of psychologists behaving badly, falsifying research, etc. but it would be foolish to conclude that the whole field is a hoax or should be ignored.

I happen to know a bunch of people that work on climate science, and in general they do it because they passionately believe in what they are doing. Several of them also happen to be brilliant. I also know some people working in climate science that don&#039;t have a clue how to construct and test a proper model. Same goes for other fields that I have worked in - Psychology, Computer Science, Neuroscience. Sturgeon&#039;s Law says that 90% of everything is crap. The trick is to find the 10% that isn&#039;t.

Ultimately it comes down to this: the field has been making general predictions for several decades now. Are those predictions coming to pass or not? The evidence is that the world is a fair bit warmer and that there is more volatility in the weather. So those predictions seems fairly solid at this point. That has to be tempered against the fact that this could be mere coincidence. It also needs to be tempered against the fact that predicting complex systems is incredibly difficult at best. However, if it was coincidence then it just as easily could have gone the other way. The question is when there is enough evidence to be sure.

Personally I think Global Warming is the wrong fight. There are loads of reasons to pursue renewable energy that are hard to argue about. Not relying on foreign governments for our energy for starters. The plummeting costs involved (e.g. solar) as it scales up. As Seth points out there is pollution. Fighting pollution covers lots of the same ground as fighting global warming, but there are not too many people who are &quot;pro pollution.&quot; Ironically I think the argument that has always been used against the pro global warming side - economics - will ultimately be the one that wins for them, just not for the reasons that they think.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The current long-lasting &quot;pause&quot; in global warming was not predicted by any model. How do the people you know in climate science deal with this fact?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Doesn&#039;t starting with the title &quot;Who is the Smartest Person Who Believes Climate Change Fear-Mongering&quot; get this off to a start begging the question?  And is the &quot;I&#039;ve met smart people who went along with bad science&quot; part supposed to be an evidence-based criticism of man-made climate change?

I&#039;m confused about the lack of science in this blog post.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I wasn&#039;t trying to convince anyone that the &quot;humans are dangerously warming the planet&quot; idea is wrong. I take that for granted. The post is about human nature, not climate change.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
