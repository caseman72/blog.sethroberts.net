		<description><![CDATA[Initially I dropped anything I could associate with sulfur.  I can handle some now, but I had overloaded my system.  I started taking molybdenum, which is need for the enzyme.  I notice beneficial effects immediately.  I think anyone suffering I.B.S symptoms ought to consider sulfur may at least be a contributor to the problem.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, that&#039;s good to know. You mean these two events -- (a) stopped sulfur and (b) started molybdenum -- happened at the same time? What is &quot;the enzyme&quot;? &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good question about the relatives dearime, I agree the article seems incomplete. Also being saved by falling on your bike after cardiac arrest sounds like a one in a million type thing, you&#039;re a very lucky guy!

Allan they probably replaced the pacemaker with a defib that could also pace her heart - I have a friend whose defib (after firing several times) was upgraded to one that could also pace - as his heart gets weaker it keeps him in a more regular rhythm to spare the damaged heart muscle as much as possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand they are not the same thing. What I don&#039;t understand, and what I&#039;m asking is would her heart have likely stopped if it was connected to a pace maker.

It&#039;s suspiciously convenient (well, to my cynical mind anyway) that within weeks/months(?) of her switching from a pace maker to a defib, the defib starts firing away, saving her life three times.

OK, it could happen, and that&#039;s great if so, but it&#039;s just kind of hanging there in the story. I think that&#039;s called begging the question. No? Of course, I&#039;m not a paid journalist. I could be wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pacemakers and defibrillators are not the same thing - a pacemaker alone will not restart a heart that has stopped completely 
- they only adjust the pace of a hearts rhythm. Although I believe they now have combined units that can perform both functions but if you don&#039;t have one of these types you don&#039;t get both benefits]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I had my first cardiac arrest I fell on top of my bike and the mechanical shock restarted my heart.  Pushing a bike around with you everywhere in life would be inconvenient I admit.  And you are not likely to gain advantage from it in bed, for example.

But sarcasm aside, I agree with Seth.  You don&#039;t half weaken a case by citing feeble evidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I hate reporters. Are they really that logically challenged, or do they think the rest of us are idiots?&quot;

I think they have a job that, like almost all jobs, requires steady output. The fewer questions you ask the faster you can finish the piece. So long as the result is not obviously idiotic, they are okay. There is a tradition in science/health reporting of giving authorities a free pass -- allowing them to say anything, no matter how self-serving, without criticism.

I do wonder if their critical faculties erode from disuse. If years of not being critical cause them to lose the ability to be critical.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m confused about the defib vs. pacemaker distinction.

They say the new defib saved her life on three occasions, but they leave hanging in the air whether the pacemaker had been doing the same thing in a prophylactic manner all along.

It&#039;s like saying a parachute saved your life three times, but your old way of making sure the aircraft had enough reserve fuel to reach its destination in event of a stiff headwind didn&#039;t accomplish anything.

I can appreciate there might be additional advantages to the defib, but saying it saved your life vs. a pacemaker isn&#039;t necessarily one of them.

		<description><![CDATA[This just shows that the advances are being pushed by those of us interested enough to look for genetic answers.  She states she found someone to test and help her &quot;after some dead ends&quot; - she actively pursued answers!  For those of us willing to look hard there are emerging answers in our genetics at places like 23 and Me. I have been dismissed by doctors saying it isn&#039;t proven science yet but there is lots of information there if you are willing to dig - and a lot backed by research studies that have not become mainstream yet]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What the lady had in common with her mother was that she probably grew up eating the same kinds of foods as her mother, and that they were both going to Medical Doctors who were on commission. Neither  one probably tried changing their diet or pursuing natural cures. Chances are it had nothing wjatsoever to do with genetics.

Genetics is nothing more than modern day voodoo, and a new scam to milk money out of unsuspecting gullible moroins who will put their health into the hands of modern witch doctors who only know how to prescribe poisons, un-needed tests, dangerous surgeries and dangerous radiation and other procedures.]]></description>
