		<description><![CDATA[The ones designing and implementing the web site were not federal workers. It was a consulting company who had previously demonstrated incompetence at this kind of project, and should probably have never been given the project. Problems were compounded by unrealistic deadlines for all the features requested, and last-minute changes, never tested. My understanding is that federal procurement rules made it difficult or impossible to choose another contractor. That’s not the fault of federal employees other than whoever drafted the laws specifying those rules.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this little-known but important piece of vaccine history.

It is also important to note that since the Cutter event, there have not been any vaccine reactions due to manufacturing issues - to my knowledge, please correct me if wrong. (I do not refer to known reactions such as the ~1 in million risk of getting paralysis from oral polio vaccine, or the ~2 in 100,000 who will get a bowel blockage after rotavirus, and the few other rare known serious vaccine reactions. 

But any time there are some serious events that happen AFTER a vaccine is given, the natural tendency for governments is to suspend vaccine use.  Eventually, the investigation finds the deaths or other events unconnected to vaccine - and meanwhile children are needlessly put at risk of infectious disease.  (Or a vaccine scare like pertussis in the UK in the 1970s or MMR-autism impact lead to massive disease outbreaks).

How do we address these cognitive biases - and focus on fixing system failures instead of blaming individuals?

***
Like others, not sure I agree this is same issue as the ObamaCare fiasco; perhaps of more substance is the what is human and financial cost of not having universal health care - even after Obamacare; and what was cost of delays in getting cover?

And what is the accountability of our political representatives, who now seem to just represent moneyed interests...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Obamacare website / polio analogy is interesting, but you seem to be perpetuating the myth that the website&#039;s problem was scalability.  Unlike Salk&#039;s efforts, the website was sloppy work from the start, riddled with broken links, misspellings, and a confusing user interface. In this case, incompetence pervaded the whole project, from the bureaucracy all the way down to individual programmers.]]></description>
