		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I am beginning to think the SE and DE are not mutually exclusive to active diabetics.&quot;

I agree. I found this in Wikipedia:

&quot;Clinical studies indicate that a high fasting glucose in the morning is more likely because the insulin given on the previous evening fails to last long enough.&quot;

I had/have a high fasting glucose in the morning but don&#039;t take insulin (and am not diabetic). 
So the explanation of the high glucose in the morning, at least in my case, cannot be my insulin didn&#039;t last long enough.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[continuing...

as my blood sugars were normally around 90 upon rising.  I have been reading about the Somogyi Effect and Dawn Phenomenon for diabetics as a possible clue to why my bs have shifted.  I am beginning to think the SE and DE are not mutually exculusive to active diabetics.  From this post, and the one about honey before bed, I am wondering if being in a state of nutritional ketosis might just only be beneficial during the day.  This thought comes about because last night I just went crazy with eating sugar before bed, and I awoke in very good spirits after having a wonderful dream.  For the last several months this has not been the case.  I usually had very uncomfortable dreams.  I think for me my hours of rest have increased to 8 hours due to the time change.  During the winter I usually will awake at 3am and stay awake for a couple of hours.

Today I am going to experiment with eating a ketosis diet through out the day and tonight I am going to have honey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, I&#039;m quoting this because I like it:

&quot;4. There is a lot of discussions of what Paleo ancestors ate. First, I’ve been following the Paleo diet for over 10 yrs and it changes every few years. It was high protein and veggies, then they added more saturated fats, then they added more tubers like sweet potatoes. For a diet that hasn’t changed in a million years, it changes about every 2 yrs with a new recommendation of how we misunderstood something.&quot;

As for the rest, honey is easy to store, but I don&#039;t have a feeling for when people invented a way (ceramics?) to store it. Could they have used animal bladders? If so, I don&#039;t think there&#039;d be a fossil record.

It&#039;s true that people don&#039;t want straight sugar for dessert. Hard candy is for snacks, not dessert. Still, dessert varies a lot in it&#039; fat/starch/protein/sugar ratio. Your basic cake is sugar/refined flour/a little egg and dairy. Cheese cake is mostly cheese and sugar. Let to themselves (no theory about nutrition), people don&#039;t use whole grains in dessert so far as I know.

I believe we need more investigation of dessert.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seth: The research showed people liked sweets much less when they were hungry. I was trying to convey it was a big effect. I see I misled you.&quot;

Fair enough, Seth. I still think you&#039;re ignoring lots of readily available evidence. You&#039;ve ignored the point about breakfast, which as the name implies is breaking a long fast, being the most commonly eaten sweet meal. That alone poses a serious challenge to your theory. That the ONE meal eaten after a long fast every day in all cultures around the world tends to be sweet, or is often sweet, and that this isn&#039;t the case with lunch or dinner, massively does not support your theory.

There there is the well known fact that heavy dieters almost always binge on sweet foods - they don&#039;t binge on steak and bacon and eggs, but donuts and ice cream and chocolate. Again, massive un-evidence. 

Sorry, it&#039;s a nice theory but it just doesn&#039;t add up. Do the right thing and move on. Truth is more important than our pet theories.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You might want to read the research I mentioned, by Elizabeth Capaldi.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Strauss, i agree with your points, and its a reason why i think there is confusion on the issue.  Fructose is incorrectly seen as bad, but its really the refined sugars and their lack of nutrients that cause problems.  Honey and fruit have a ton of nutrients that accompany the sugars and help them metabolize.  Second, the glucose and fructose are free and not bound together like in sucrose.
Third, i agree that the primariy benefit of sugar is supporting the brain.  With only ~2% of body mass and yet consuming 20% of the calories, keeping the brain healthy with a steady supply of fuel seems paramount.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth Roberts, I believe your theory how about sugar improves is correct, but I do not quite agree with the explanation for diabetes. To me, a simpler explanation would be that our livers need a certain amount of micronutrients to digest properly high amounts of sugar, including magnesium, complex B, conpenzyme q10 and choline (choline is needed in liver to properly export triglyclerydes produced by excessive ingestion of alcohol and sugar, see this post made by Chris Masterjohnson: http://blog.cholesterol-and-health.com/2010/12/meeting-choline-requirement-eggs-organs.html).

So the brain prefers to ingest sugar after a meal because half of it is glucose, who can provide immediate energy for brain, and the another half, fructose, is metabolyzed exclusively in liver, providing a stable source of glucose for a brain whose body cannot store high amounts of glucose. My proposal to fix your theory is that sugar (and honey) helps improve not only sleep, but our health and brain function as well. But if we ingest insufficient ammount of those mentioned micronutrients and high amounts of sugar, we&#039;ll develop metabolyc syndrome and inexorably DM II. Of course, like traveling to Rome, there are many ways to develop DM II, not just this one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a few thoughts:
1.  i think we crave sweets after meals because we didn&#039;t get sugar during the meal, not because we naturally prefer it after a meal.  In other words, if you have steak and potatoes, you may crave dessert.  If you have a Morrocan meal with meat, rice, figs and honey, you may not crave sweets after a meal.  (This would be easy to test). 
2.  No one craves just sugar.  They want dessert, which is fat, starch and sugar together, so i see sugar as part of a balanced diet.
3.  Almost all starches and meats are more palatable when eaten with sugar.  Breakfast cereals are loaded with added suga;, meats like barbaque are covered in sugary sauces.    I mean is there anyone when hungry who likes plain oatmeal???  No, we love it with brown sugar and fruit or honey.  
4.  There is a lot of discussions of what Paleo ancestors ate.  First, I&#039;ve been following the Paleo diet for over 10 yrs and it changes every few years.  It was high protein and veggies, then they added more saturated fats, then they added more tubers like sweet potatoes.  For a diet that hasn&#039;t changed in a million years, it changes about every 2 yrs with a new recommendation of how we misunderstood something.  
5.  Which brings me to #5, Paleo people say we would not have had access to sugar but traditional peoples have collected honey throughout history.  Honey can be stored indefinitely, so i kind of roll my eyes when a Paleo advocate says that we should only eat honey if you&#039;ve gone through the trouble to climb a rope ladder, beat off beats, recover the honey and sprint away from the bees.  Those same people never say you can only eat meat if you have run for miles, tracked an animal, killed it, skinned it, and carried it back to your tribe.  My point is just that i think we have to be careful creating narratives for why we should or should not do something.
6.  Finally, we don&#039;t live a Paleo life.  We struggle under a 10 hour cognitively demanding job with more chronic stress which has been shown to damage the brain, given sugars role in providing energy for the brain (mostly through the liver), its makes sense that we might crave (and therefore need) more sugar than we had during Paleo times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think an interesting question to ask would be: Do people who eat deserts after dinner eat big breakfasts, smaller breakfasts, or no breakfast? And do people who eat big breakfasts tend to eat desert after dinner?

When I am hungry but not stressed I crave meat and/or fat. When I&#039;m hungry and stressed I tend to still crave meat and/or fat but less of it and only two things as &quot;desert&quot; satisfy my &quot;sweet&quot; craving: yogurt or dairy (e.g. milk) or something sweet.

Another question I&#039;d be interested in knowing the answer to is do people who eat more full fat yogurt crave less sugar?]]></description>

<p>When I am hungry but not stressed I crave meat and/or fat. When I&#8217;m hungry and stressed I tend to still crave meat and/or fat but less of it and only two things as &#8220;desert&#8221; satisfy my &#8220;sweet&#8221; craving: yogurt or dairy (e.g. milk) or something sweet.</p>
<p>Another question I&#8217;d be interested in knowing the answer to is do people who eat more full fat yogurt crave less sugar?</p>

&quot;Why do people fuss so much about paleo life? The population has grown so much since that it’s easy to believe that we’ve evolved a long way from then.&quot;

I&#039;m not sure that I understand your question. But the people who &quot;fuss so much&quot; about paleo are usually the people who think eating a 100% plant-based diet is the ONLY way to eat. Which is preposterous, of course. Man evolved while eating animals, animal fat, fish, insects, snakes, etc., and certainly veggies and fruits (when in season) for millions of years. That&#039;s why we are omnivores, not carnivores or herbivores. And we&#039;ve thrived.

On the other hand, it&#039;s only been about 10,000 years (since the beginning of agriculture) that we&#039;ve eaten things like grains, especially wheat, year-round fruit, etc. Which is basically a blink of the eye, in terms of evolution. Many of us think our health has suffered for it. Others don&#039;t agree. Thus the &quot;fuss.&quot;

Also, it seems to be a sort of religious experience for one side, saying and implying that those of us who choose to eat animals and animal fat, like we have for millions of years, are now &quot;unethical.&quot;  You can probably imagine how some us would respond to that. Hint: Not very well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I agree that honey just before bedtime improves my sleep. I’d like to know why.&quot;

I think the idea that &quot;honey before bedtime improves sleep&quot; is far from proven (although the idea that &quot;sweets in the evening improve my own sleep&quot; is proven beyond doubt). It is also unclear to me how much weight (a lot? none? moderate amount?) to put on what people tell me about their sleep. For example, you tell me that honey before bedtime has improved your sleep. How much weight should I put on that?

By looking into associated phenomena, such as the notion that when we are hungry, we don&#039;t want sweets, I learn more about both issues (1. is it generally true that bedtime honey improves sleep? 2. Should I trust what people tell me about their sleep?) If the answer to both #1 and #2 is yes, then the idea that we don&#039;t like sweets when we&#039;re hungry makes sense. If the answer to both #1 and #2 is no, the idea that we don&#039;t like sweets when we&#039;re hungry is not explained.

I agree with you, this post is no help in understanding why bedtime honey improves sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that honey just before bedtime improves my sleep.  I&#039;d like to know why.

But jumping from that personal observation to the theory that people eat sweets after supper so as to improve their sleep ignores other lines of thought.  

1) Many people eat their last meal hours before they go to sleep.  The honey effect, for me, depends upon honey ingestion within 1 hour of bedtime, not a dessert immediately after supper.

2) People eat sugar throughout the day, when they need to stay awake.  One line of proof includes inspecting the menus of breakfast chains such as Dennys, IHOP, and Perkins.  Another line of proof: stand in a fast food chain during lunch, the kind where people buy a cup and fill their drink at will from the dispenser.  What percentage of customers select a sugared soft drink?  From my limited personal experience, I remember it as being a large percentage.  

3) Using soft drinks as a measurable product of how Americans consume lots of sugar, using a search engine to look for its consumption before bedtime yields few results.  Searches such as: &quot;bedtime coke&quot;, &quot;bedtime cola&quot;, &quot;bedtime soda&quot;.  

4) Then again, Americans do love their ice cream.  The search phrase, &quot;ice cream before bedtime&quot; yields a wild mixture of positive and negative search hits.  Apparently, if you eat ice cream before bedtime, either you lose weight and sleep better, or you gain weight and have nightmares.

If I remember correctly, the speculation that desserts improve sleep originated due to a dinner party where dessert was served, thus, it was concluded, it was the dessert that improved sleep.  However, there are at least two alternate theories.  

The first, which is the one I prefer, is that a dinner party is a minor stress event which typically ends well.  It is stressful because people might not like your jokes and stories, or you may be stuck talking with a bore.  Also, you have to be &#039;on stage&#039; for a long period of time.  It&#039;s similar to going on a vacation and exploring a bunch of new places.  

The second explanation is that a dinner party simulates paleo life; a day of hunting/gathering, followed by sitting around the fire talking with companions and hearing and telling stories.  What is similar in modern life?  Many people, after a day of work, watch TV, where they see friendly faces and hear stories.  A dinner party is a more intense expression because one not only consumes but tells stories.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a personal observation - I will eat sugar when I am hungry but I realize I don&#039;t find it satisfying. If I&#039;m not careful I will look for more sweet foods (the idea of pay attention and don&#039;t eat mindlessly) and end up feeling slightly sick but if I eat something not sweet the hunger is more satisfied.

		<description><![CDATA[Research has shown that we like sugar ONLY when we are not hungry?

Wow, I shudder for the state of scientific research. ONLY when we are hungry, not even just it&#039;s more common when we are not hungry? 

Okay, I&#039;m outta here. This place is a joke. Pure nonsense, and an unwillingngess to back off from nonsensical claims.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The research showed people liked sweets much less when they were hungry. I was trying to convey it was a big effect. I see I misled you.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Surely hunger was very common long ago. If hunger gets rid of or at least reduces our sweet tooth, that is a stunning fact. Having a sweet tooth makes sense -- because sugar supplies energy -- so not having one...how strange!]]></description>
