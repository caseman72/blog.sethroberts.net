		<description><![CDATA[Joe, I have a friend who gets sick (he describes it as his digestion shutting down) if he doesn&#039;t eat a lot of wheat, and it&#039;s the same for at least one of his relatives.

While I think there are tendencies in what foods are good and bad for people, I think the only advice I&#039;d give to everyone is &quot;give some attention to how your food affects you&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[Dearieme, I may not know your country as well as you do, but I do know that London is in Britain. And I have no idea why you&#039;d use the word &quot;scarcely&quot; there. Perhaps you&#039;re just trying to pull my leg?  :)

You won&#039;t tell me what U.S. city you visited, but I need to tell you that you have a very narrow perspective of my country. It&#039;s a VERY big place. You&#039;re painting us with a very narrow brush. Yes, we have places where the people rarely walk. But we also have places where we seldom do anything else. I always drove to work or took the train. Mostly because I didn&#039;t exactly want to walk or ride a bicycle the 30-40 miles to the office and back. Like I said, we&#039;re a VERY big country. But that didn&#039;t stop me from jogging 5-6 miles when I got home, etc.

You&#039;ve probably heard of the blind men and the elephant story?

Well, the next time you come over here, you really do need to grab more parts of the &quot;elephant.&quot; :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, those are valid questions. I don&#039;t eat grains not because of paleo, but because grains are bad for me. Grains, especially wheat (rice isn&#039;t so bad, which is why I eat a little sushi from time to time), provide almost no nutrition (which is why it always needs to be &quot;fortified.&quot; I concentrate on eating NUTRIENT-DENSE foods. I want as much nutrition as I can get out of a food. Eating grains is much like eating sugar (as far as I&#039;m concerned) - it&#039;s just empty calories. And they&#039;ll just help to make you fat. There is no way that eating grains can improve your health profiles (BS marketing by the grain companies aside), simply because it brings nothing good to the nutritional party. It does, however, bring some bad things, and if you&#039;re interested in learning about them, you can&#039;t beat Dr. Wm. Davis&#039;s book, &quot;Wheat Belly.&quot; In short, today&#039;s wheat is nothing like the wheat your grandmother ate.

I would never recommend that anyone eat grains, especially wheat. On the other hand, if that was all I had to eat (which has happened at times to various populations in our history), of course I&#039;d eat it. I&#039;d eat just about anything if my very survival was at stake. But we have choices today, perhaps too many choices, and I think we should be thankful for them, and exploit them to the fullest.

You say that you still use the paleo framework a lot. I think by eating lots of potatoes, beans, corn and other grains, and things like fruit juice, and bingeing on chocolate, etc., you&#039;ve left the paleo &quot;framework&quot; in your rear view mirror. It&#039;s much like a vegan regularly eating meat and still claiming to be a vegan. Tweaking a &quot;framework&quot; on the edges is one thing, but that&#039;s not what you&#039;re doing (IMO).

Look, just by eating real foods, avoiding processed and refined foods, and sugar, you may somewhat improve your health markers. You sound like that may be good enough for you. It&#039;s just not good enough for me. But whatever you do, don&#039;t stress over it. Grab the bit and run!  And good luck!

PS: If you do find anything outside the paleo framework that&#039;s more healthy, please let me know! I&#039;ve been looking for many years and I can&#039;t find anything even close.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[London, Joe, is scarcely in Britain at all.

No, back in &#039;66 it was striking to this foreigner how little exercise Americans seemed to take.  I know that much of your climate is unsuitable for the sort of country walks, and the more testing hill-walking, that are so popular here year round.  I understand that gardening for nine months of the year would be pretty brutal in much of the US.  But heavens, your population even plays golf largely sitting on its bums.  And, in that one three month spell (and many short visits since) everyone has emphasised to me that nobody walked anywhere.  They even drive to the gym!!  I don&#039;t know about you but for most of my career I cycled to work.  You can in our climate (though it&#039;s kinder in the dry east of the country).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to try and get back to the original question, about why we obsess over Paleo life.  The short answer, is that many people believe we are best adapted to Paleo life and the further we move away from it, the further we move away from optimal health.  Second, because its impossible to test every single aspect of health, it helps to have a framework.  Did Paleo man have access to high fructose corn syrup in handy little aluminum cans?  No, then maybe we shouldn&#039;t either.  No need to wait until a bunch of studies come out, we can use the Paleo framework right now to make the decision.  

My specific issue is that we need to be careful and not over-rely on a single framework because its based on our best guess of what happened a million years ago.  That doesn&#039;t mean its worthless, it just means that its one of several potential possibilities.  

So Joe, let me ask this question:  If someone followed a Paleo diet (which i&#039;m going to assume still prohibits grains) and then that person as an experiment ate grains for a 6 months and felt better and had better biomarkers, would you:
1.  Recommend that they keep eating grains because it appears to be good for them even though Paleo man didn&#039;t have them.
2.  Recommend they don&#039;t eat grains because Paleo man did not have access to them and therefore there may be other harmful things going on that are not represented in the way they feel or their test results (i.e. silent evidence).  

I would say #1 and i&#039;m guessing you would say #2.  And don&#039;t get me wrong, i fully understand position #2 and believe silent evidence is very important to consider.  Joe, you and i began to disagree over a few points, but i want you to know that i still use the Paleo framework quite a lot.  It&#039;s not something i completely dismiss, but i&#039;m willing to consider that things outside the Paleo framework, even opposite to it, may be more healthy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Because i was trying to be like Grok.&quot;

I&#039;ll take that to mean: just for the hell of it.

But if you can&#039;t live without eating lots of potatoes, beans, corn and other grains, fruit juice, etc., then paleo isn&#039;t for you. And if you are doing &quot;chronic cardio,&quot; yes, you ARE damaging your heart, but jogging vs walking has nothing to do with it. It&#039;s the amount of time and miles you put in. The actual science behind this is all over the internet, so you don&#039;t need to listen to paleo gurus. So I&#039;m not really sure that you know what chronic cardio is, either.

I have a bit of chocolate, myself.  But only really dark chocolate (88%). It&#039;s actually good for the heart. The way I usually satisfy my own sweet tooth, the part that remains, is to eat various paleo treats made with sweeteners like stevia and xylitol. But infrequently. Mostly just on holidays.

So, now that we&#039;ve seen that paleo isn&#039;t for you, and because I really have no idea how you are currently eating, all I can do is wish you good luck! So...good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Then why did you try paleo???&quot;   Because i was trying to be like Grok.  

Joe, these days Paleo has a lot of variability, you could argue an all meat Inuit diet is Paleo as is a super high carb Kitavan diet, but i started Paleo back when it was more low carb,  when everyone talked about the carb flu and getting passed it, about being fat adapted, when you had to watch fruit intake because too much would be too much sugar, etc. It was mostly veggies for carbs and i don&#039;t consider veggies carbs.  No way broccoli gets me through the day the way potatoes do.  I followed the likes of Cordain, Sisson, Art Devany,  and others and it was lower carb.  I felt it was more strict back when i was following it and i admit that i kept trying to go low carb to get fat adapted and break through the carb flu.  

I&#039;m aware of the chronic cardio vs moving slowly distinction in Paleo, but i&#039;ve been doing a little more &quot;chronic cardio&quot; and i feel better.  I&#039;m sure someone will say i&#039;m damaging my heart and should be walking and not jogging, but i feel better and i&#039;m not over doing it.  I&#039;m not training to be a marathon racer.  (I do agree with the Paleo idea on that being harmful).  

As for blood iron levels, i don&#039;t have a genetic disease but i do give blood frequently now.  I ate so much red meat on Paleo (I bought it from a local farmer where his cows were 100% grassfed) that i began to detest it.  

Today i had leftover potatoes, lima beans, and pot roast for lunch, when i was doing Paleo the potoates and beans would have not been allowed.  I find i feel much better with higher starch and sugar content like potatoes, beans, corn and grains.  I also had horrible sugar cravings during Paleo that never went away and i would binge on chocolate sometimes.  Now i just eat honey or drink fruit juice if i can.  Are they Paleo?  Well they weren&#039;t a few years ago, maybe now they are.  

My point is it goes back to Seth&#039;s post where he said: &quot;Eating breakfast made my sleep worse. No paleo guru had said that — I had been right to ignore them.&quot;   I got some good ideas out of Paleo, but at some point, like Seth mentioned, i needed to ignore the paleo gurus and try some things that were not part of the Paleo doctrine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;m not surprised you saw no cricket, Dearieme. :) But no baseball, no softball, no field hockey, no hockey, no soccer, no football, no flag football, no rugby, no bicycling, no jogging, no lacrosse? Wow. Even in the 60s, those were pretty popular activities. Not like they are today, but still very popular.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I&#8217;m not surprised you saw no cricket, Dearieme. <img src='http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  But no baseball, no softball, no field hockey, no hockey, no soccer, no football, no flag football, no rugby, no bicycling, no jogging, no lacrosse? Wow. Even in the 60s, those were pretty popular activities. Not like they are today, but still very popular. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[Dearieme:

It was just a guess anyway. But the fitness craze wasn&#039;t isolated to the U.S. Do you really think that the UK took &quot;far more exercise&quot; than we Yanks? Really?

But isn&#039;t it interesting to know that you can effectively give yourself a coronary bypass operation (increasing the flow of blood to your heart) with the right kind of exercise? 

I do!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David: &quot; I was very healthy before Paleo&quot;

Then why did you try paleo???

&quot;Most damaging in my opinion was the low carb recommendations and the lack of cardio vascular workouts.&quot;

David, I can see by those comments that you don&#039;t know much if anything about paleo. First, paleo doesn&#039;t have to be &quot;low-carb.&quot; You can essentially eat all the veggies you want! You can eat fruits, too! Especially if you don&#039;t have a weight problem. I average between 100-150 grams of carbs per day. That&#039;s an awful lot of carbs, David. And sometimes even more. 

And in no way is cardio exercise discouraged! Just the opposite, in fact.  What IS discouraged, is something called &quot;chronic cardio.&quot; That&#039;s basically the marathon and half-marathon type runners. Repeat after me: Chronic cardio is bad.  Cardio is good.  I run 5k about 5 times per week. Sometimes I just briskly walk it. I never go further than 5k. And I always do it outside. And I don&#039;t stress out if I happen to miss a couple days. Note: Just about anyone can do 5K.

&quot;I really like many of the Paleo principals, but I don’t consider eating real food, lowering your stress, exercising and getting more sleep to be anything more than common sense.&quot;

Semantics, David.  Call it what you want, but paleo is all about common sense. Eating REAL food.  Not eating processed or refined food. Lowering your stress. Exercising. And sleeping. Note: saying you work 10 hours a day and can&#039;t find the time to run or walk for 30-35 minutes each day is known as bull ca ca.

&quot;The point of Seth’s post was “why worry about Paleo”.&quot;

The only ones here who appear to &quot;worry about Paleo&quot; are the folks who aren&#039;t doing paleo, or don&#039;t appear to understand what paleo actually is.  And isn&#039;t

&quot;eating so much meat gave my clinically high serum ferritin levels.&quot;

Have you been checked for hereditary chromatosis or liver disease?  Do you have RA? Some solutions : eat less red meat and donate blood from time to time (which is a good idea anyway). Stop being so rigid, David!

&quot;After almost ten years of playing that game, i finally gave up.&quot;

That&#039;s too bad. I wonder if you were ever really on paleo? 

But it&#039;s definitely your prerogative!

Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, i appreciate your view of Paleo, but i followed the Paleo diet for several years and for most Paleo advocates, it&#039;s a belief system, a lens that you need to review everything through.  Did Grok do it?  If not, then you probably should not either.  I later abandoned Paleo after several years because 1) was slowly gaining weight 2) stopped making progress in the gym 3) sleep got worse and 4) had low energy and it was affecting my work, 5) eating so much meat gave my clinically high serum ferritin levels.  I was very healthy before Paleo and got less and less healthy during Paleo, so i dropped it after about 7 yrs although i bought into it for far too long and believe it really affected my health.  Most damaging in my opinion was the low carb recommendations and the lack of cardio vascular workouts. 

I really like many of the Paleo principals, but I don&#039;t consider eating real food, lowering your stress, exercising and getting more sleep to be anything more than common sense.  The issue of grains and dairy are still debatable in my mind (my wife is 100% gluten free by choice).   

I agree that Paleo has helped many people, but many of those seem to have had health problems before finding Paleo.

The point of Seth&#039;s post was &quot;why worry about Paleo&quot;.  I agree with him and you that its a valuable framework, but i&#039;m much more willing to ignore the Paleo advice if my personal experience differs.  In the past, it was: &quot;No, high carbs are bad.  You just need to get through the carb flu and get fat adapted.&quot;  After almost ten years of playing that game, i finally gave up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David: &quot;The problem i have with Paleo is that’s its a narrative, a belief system about what to eat. If Grok only got honey infrequently because he would have to scavage it from bees, then you should not eat honey at night – even if we discover it helps.&quot;

That&#039;s simply not true, David.  If it helps you to take a little honey at night (say, to sleep better), go ahead and have a bit of honey. I get a good amount of sleep, but I tried it anyway, and it didn&#039;t help me at all. On the other hand, there are many reasons that some people sleep poorly, right?  Maybe there are other ways to &quot;skin the cat&quot;?  Magnesium, potassium and Vitamin D deficiencies can easily wreak havoc with your sleep. Why not check that out, too? Or carefully review your daily routines.  Anything there that might be affecting your sleep?  

But a little bit of nightly honey is not even close to being a deal breaker, as far as paleo goes. It might, however, cause you to gain weight and/or affect various health markers.

&quot;We do not fully understand Paleo.&quot;

Agreed! But that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not a great place to start, does it? That is, eat what YOU think paleo is. 

For example, eat real foods, eat no processed or refined foods, no industrial oils, no sugar and no wheat. See what that does for you. More importantly, see what it does to your health  markers. Then decide if you want to add or subtract any foods. See what THAT does for you. See what THAT does to your health markers. Etc.

For some strange reason, you&#039;ve come to think of paleo as a rigid system.  It&#039;s not! Compared to diets like vegetarianism and veganism, which eliminate entire food groups(!), paleo is about as permissive and logical as a lifestyle can get.  It&#039;s all about experimenting. Also, paleo isn&#039;t just about what you eat, it&#039;s about how to live a healthier life; it includes getting more exercise, and getting it outdoors (whenever possible). Getting good sleep. Etc.

&quot;I find using evolutionary history as a valuable framework&quot;

Indeed it is!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The issue with the 80/20 rule was initially put forth as a way of making Paleo easier to follow, now its a way to say, &quot;we might be wrong so experiment.&quot;  Paleo is an entire lifestyle change and therefore virtually impossible to know what is really causing improvements in some people&#039;s health.  

The problem i have with Paleo is that&#039;s its a narrative, a belief system about what to eat.  If Grok only got honey infrequently because he would have to scavage it from bees, then you should not eat honey at night  - even if we discover it helps.  I don&#039;t find that logic compelling, and one thing i have noticed about the Paleo diet over the last decade is that it keeps evolving.  First it was protein and veggies with low fat, then they added saturated fat, then tubers, i recently saw a paper on legumes being Paleo.  At this rate, Paleo will involve eating bread in the next year.  Pioners like Mark Sisson have said they would change certain things in their books.  Robb Wolf has been making big changes in his understanding of Paleo.  We do not fully understand Paleo.  

I find using evolutionary history as a valuable framework, but i&#039;m more into finding an optimal diet and lifestyle, and i believe some answers might be outside the current Paleo understanding.

		<description><![CDATA[Dearieme, one reason (I&#039;m sure there are more) for the plunge in heart attacks since 1970 could be this:

&quot;When there is increasing traffic volume on a highway, it may make sense to make the highway into a larger freeway to allow a higher traffic volume. In short, the same happens to the coronary arteries: When blood flow is increased, the inner layer of vessel cells (endothelial cells) sense this necessity and start the process of enlarging from capillaries into genuine collateral vessels. In response to endurance exercise training (such as running, bicycling, swimming, and hiking), blood flow is increased, which leads to a conversion from capillaries into collaterals. This is a very elegant treatment everybody can accomplish. It reduces the chances of the occurrence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarctions, and death. Beyond the interventional, surgical, and medical treatments against coronary artery disease, this collateral training is a natural and valuable therapy that many patients can apply by themselves, for themselves, if only they are aware of it. &quot;

In short, exercise can create new collateral arteries, which is akin to giving yourself your own by-pass operation! I don&#039;t know exactly when the fitness craze started (the 70s, it seems), but perhaps that has had more of an effect than we thought?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gina: &quot;You eat nothing like Grok. Grok wouldn’t even recognize the meat and vegetables that you eat.&quot;

How do you know what I eat?  Was that you peeking in the kitchen window the other night? You were wearing a pointed cap and carrying a broom, right?

I eat as close to what Grok ate as I can, only better. I eat grass-fed meats (including organ meats and bone marrow), wild game, like venison, elk, rabbit, wild-caught fish, organic veggies and fruits, even some so-called exotic foods, like snails, oysters, etc.

&quot;Eat some cattails and bugs and wash it down with some untreated water and you might be getting closer to Grok’s ballpark.&quot;

I&#039;ve eaten cattails, and a lot of other stuff you wouldn&#039;t touch with a ten-foot pole. Like snakes, maggots, grubs, bugs, lizzards, etc.  In the service, I was taught to eat just about anything, if anything was all I had to eat. Including untreated water, which is pretty easy to do if you know how. Grok knew how. And so do I.

&quot;Avoiding processed foods is a great idea, but it doesn’t mean anyone is really eating &#039;paleo.&#039;&quot;

It&#039;s means they&#039;re on their way, and that&#039;s a &quot;good thing&quot;!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dearieme: &quot;Heart disease rates have collapsed: the mysterious rise from the 1920s to the 1960s has been followed by a mysterious fall since.&quot;

You&#039;re absolutely right! It peaked in the 70s and has been plummeting ever since. And well before anyone ever heard of statin drugs. For more about this phenomenon, read this book: &quot;You Will Not Die of A Heart Attack,&quot; by Dr. David S. Grimes. Smoking appears to be the main suspect, but there is no clear answer.

&quot;Allow me to recommend it to you.&quot;

I have no problem at all with fish and chips that are made without industrial oils and wheat flour. Know of any? :)

&quot;I think it most unlikely that we haven’t evolved to eat grains in the last 10000 years.&quot;

I disagree.  Read Dr. Davis&#039;s great book, &quot;Wheat Belly,&quot; for all the details. Also, the wheat being grown today is not the wheat your grandmother ate.

&quot;Cancer is the subject of much hysteria.&quot;  Unfortunately, that&#039;s true, too. We have no idea what causes cancer (in general). And now we&#039;re blaming relatively harmless viruses for it. :(

&quot;As for obesity, who knows? Perhaps it’s caused by an infection that stops the feeling of satiety working properly?&quot;

I think the vast majority of obesity is caused by what we eat, and how we live. Ditto diabetes.

&quot;I see two rational responses. (i) Eat a mixed diet, in moderation; certainly avoid slurping large beakers of brown sugar-water; probably include far more fish than is, for example, the American norm. (ii) See whether you can learn by self-experimentation, such as that advocated by our blogger, but don’t assume that the lessons that apply to you necessarily apply to everyone else.&quot;

I have no problem with any of that, Dearieme, accept perhaps with the word &quot;moderation.&quot; That&#039;s what seems to trip a lot of folks up. And especially if it works for you, and your health markers are okay. Good luck!]]></description>
