Here&#039;s my hunch (if we&#039;re lucky). The 21st century will find us making more progress against disease, especially one like cancer (including ways to totally prevent them), even cures, by exploring clean new paths, instead of mindlessly following the same old, pothole-riddled ones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: &quot;. . . overpromising of oncogene researchers . . . You know this how?&quot;

Proof of performance.  Collins never promised to cure cancer, he promised --and delivered-- on mapping the human genome.  This latest is not much different than a contractor&#039;s promise to build a high-rise bigger than one successfully built before.  In this case, a high-rise that makes extensive use of building techniques pioneered in the previous project.

You put Collins&#039; description in with two examples of issue advocacy; issues where real performance has always lagged far behind the verbiage.  Both Gnarr&#039;s and Watson&#039;s hopes/promises have followed the traditional success (and failure) rates for political change and cancer therapy.  Neither has &#039;bumped&#039; or radically altered the trajectory of their subjects.  Gnarr and Watson promise changes of *things*: governance and cures.  Collins&#039; promise is discovery.

Can I or anyone guarantee the project&#039;s on-time on-cost performance 10 years out?  No, but nobody can absolutely predict anything --perhaps not even the sunrise-- ten years out.  But &#039;reasonable expectation&#039; is a reasonable description of the brain mapping project.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You believe Collins&#039;s promise (&quot;to figure out [in 10 years] exactly how the brain works&quot;) is not much different than &quot;a contractor&#039;s promise to build a high-rise bigger than one successfully built before&quot;? Surely not. If Collins truly thinks that mapping a network = finding out exactly how something works, he has lost his marbles and should be removed from his job. If Collins knows better but thinks his listeners will believe anything, that is unfortunate and really is a lot like a parent telling a three-year-old about Santa Claus.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gnarr squeaked into office on a 34% combined protest vote /comedy /off-the-wall campaign and has made some progress on his promises, but Reykjavik&#039;s major --and very real-- problems are still there.  Overstatements are expected in campaigns.

Watson helped discover DNA structure while pursuing anti-cancer strategies.  Your quote is from his campaign (note the word &#039;campaign&#039;) to free up more cancer research money and again change the FDA&#039;s perpetually outdated drug-testing policies.  Overstatement is expected in campaigns.

Collins shepherded the Human Genome Project, the DNA mapping project that allowed Watson to dream so large.  Now he is describing a vastly larger, longer, and more complex project; but he&#039;s describing a reasonable expectation for a decade-long project.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You are unaware of the overpromising of oncogene researchers? Collins is &quot;describing a reasonable expectation&quot;? You know this how?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’d rather have scientist run ahead of themselves out of ambition, then pessimistic scientists who don’t even try.&quot;

I agree. I know Seth Roberts isn&#039;t opposed to cutting edge medical research per se, just to inflated claims and academic group-think. However, posts like this easily read as arguments against biotech, genetics research, stem cell research, etc.

There&#039;s only so much fermented foods and honey before bedtime can do to extend healthy human lifespan.]]></description>
