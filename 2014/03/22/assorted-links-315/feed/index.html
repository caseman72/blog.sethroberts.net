		<description><![CDATA[Not sure why I&#039;m stepping into this argument, it&#039;s going nowhere. But Shelley, your comment &quot;And why you are not built to eat meat. The evidence is out there for anyone with half a brain&quot; deserves some reply, because it&#039;s a half-brained comment itself. We&#039;ve been using tools to directly hunt for at least 2.5m years, and for scavenge work before that. We&#039;ve also been outsourcing part of the digestion process through fire for a long, long time (see Richard Wrangham&#039;s work). That&#039;s why we didn&#039;t need to evolve omnivorous teeth and stomachs to become omnivores, and we did do some evolving anyway (stomachs shrunk, for example). We&#039;re a different kind of omnivore than the rest, and we got there in a completely unique way.
What does seem almost certain is if we didn&#039;t go through that meating-eating evolution, our brains wouldn&#039;t have encephalized and you wouldn&#039;t be able to have this argument with Joe. Our brains would likely be about 65% smaller. Of course, that doesn&#039;t guarantee meat eating is the right approach going forward, but if we didn&#039;t eat meat the past 2.5m years, we wouldn&#039;t be human. That&#039;s important to some of us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Joe i am not going to debate endlessly with you&quot;

And yet, here you are, debating endlessly with me.  Can&#039;t stop yourself? Maybe if you ate some animal fat, you could, eh?

&quot;Do you salivate when you see a cow or a chicken?&quot;

Do you salivate when you see a carrot?  How inane can you possibly be?

&quot;Going plant-based is a big shift for the body to undertake&quot;

I can see why that would be. It&#039;s because your body is crying out for some good ol&#039; animal fat and protein, the same stuff that humans ate for hundreds of thousands of years! The same stuff we EVOLVED on.

&quot;I was listening to a past Coast to Coast interview.&quot;

So, you believe in aliens and alien abductions, too, eh?  That doesn&#039;t really surprise me. And yet you make fun of Minger.

&quot;Even a small amount of red meat, with low amounts of saturated fat, was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality.&quot;

Not so!

http://chriskresser.com/does-red-meat-increase-your-risk-of-death

But before you read that, make sure you understand the difference between correlation and causation. Ask your granddaughter to explain it to you.

I&#039;ll finish this off by saying your slavish devotion to your guru and cult leader is unbecoming. In fact, had you lived in San Francisco, back in the 70s, I&#039;m sure you would have been a member of the People&#039;s Temple. And you would have probably inhaled the Kool-Aid all the way down to Jonestown and beyond.

I feel sorry for you, Shelley, even though you&#039;re almost as nasty as McDougall, your cult leader. But then that&#039;s to be expected.  It&#039;s all part of the brainwashing process, right?

Sigh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe i am not going to debate endlessly with you about why meat eating and dairy farming are bad for the environment. And why you are not built to eat meat. The evidence is out there for anyone with half a brain. Joe you are not an obligate carnivore. Do you salivate when you see a cow or a chicken? Like a cat does? Of course not.

The paleo diet is discussed over and over on mc dougall forums. It is nonsense. Don&#039;t be brain washed. it is not good for anything. it&#039;s an excuse so meat eaters can contine eating meat.

What we can&#039;t find is any experimental support for a &quot;paleo&quot; or &quot;ancestral diet&quot; approach, or deliberate increase in cholesterol, saturated fat, or animal food, doing anything like:

 Reducing incidence of angina
 Reducing atherosclerotic lesions
 Reducing incidence of heart attacks
 Reducing diabetes
 Reducing obesity
 Reducing cancer

If these diets are the natural and proper diet for humans, where&#039;s the science showing a correlation between increasing cholesterol, saturated fat, or animal consumption and reduced risk or incidence of any of these?

As Dr. McDougall puts it in his Starch Solution video, all civilized populations have relied on grains and starches. Agriculture allowed us to achieve the ability to do other things besides forage for food. The Paleos do not have to forage either. They go down to the store and grab a prepackaged, hormone-injected, frozen carcass. In no way is it the same.

Going plant-based is a big shift for the body to undertake, ridding itself of the toxins and hormones in animal products, and if someone isn&#039;t fully adherent, that process is going to stall or take much longer, and the benefits may not fully materialize.

It took most of us years of bad eating to develop health problems, so it&#039;s unreasonable to think that it won&#039;t take time for our bodies to adjust. 

The difference is that the Mc Dougall way of eating isn&#039;t based solely on how past populations ate or glorifying those primitive peoples. This WOE isn&#039;t opposed to progress. Even so, the starches and grains we consume are very similar to what past civilizations consumed. 

Paleos are in denial that what they&#039;re consuming in any way resembles what early man ate, either in quality or quantity. The fresh fruits and vegetables aspect is good, but the meat consumption is much heavier and processed. 

Early man probably ate more like rural Asians - mainly plant-based with some occasional animal product. If they were healthier (debatable), it was because they ate only whole foods and their animal consumption was still relatively low...especially compared with the SAD diet and how most Paleos interpret the amount of meat they should consume. 

If Paleo leaders urged their followers to eat mainly fruits, vegetables and an occassional small serving of meat, there&#039;d be no problem, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what&#039;s being advised, is it?

Diet choices should always be about long term health. The human body can live on an amazingly bad diet for short time periods and even find them enjoyable. It&#039;s what happens long term that have driven people to certain cultural preferences. For most of recorded history it&#039;s been a starch based diet with the inclusion of small amounts of meat. We have culturally reversed these choices of late and are paying the price. 

I was listening to a past Coast to Coast interview. George Noory asked why was his doctor saying just the opposite of what Dr. McDougall says in &quot;The Starch Solution&quot;. Dr. McDougall explained that his son 4 years ago graduated from Medical School and as when he went to school there weren&#039;t any classes in nutrition. George then said you aren&#039;t telling anyone not to eat meat? Dr. McDougall said of course not.. but if someone came to me who was smoking and was worried about lung disease, I wouldn&#039;t tell him to cut back to two cigarettes a day.


Eating animal-derived foods causes our most common diseases for many well-established reasons, including the indisputable facts that they contain no dietary fiber, are filthy with disease-causing microbes (including mad cow prions, and E. coli and salmonella bacteria), and contain the highest levels of poisonous environmental chemicals found in the food chain. Remember, disease-causing red meats, poultry, fish, and eggs are not needed in our diets.


In March 2012, the Harvard School of Public Health published results of a study on red meat that followed 120,000 people over more than 20 years. In one sentence, the study found that eating any amount of red meat increases the risk of premature death, and the risk of mortality rises proportionately as you increase your consumption. Substituting other healthy protein sources (nuts, fish, poultry, and legumes) was associated with a somewhat lower risk of mortality.

Even a small amount of red meat, with low amounts of saturated fat, was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality. This raises the question of &quot;why&quot;? Frankly, nobody has a definitive answer. One suspected dangerous ingredient is heme iron (the iron found in red meat), which causes oxidative damage throughout the body. Other suspects are preservatives used in processed meats, which convert to carcinogens inside the body. 

Here are a couple mechanisms whereby meat causes disease.

&quot;Joe- if you made it to age 80 and your health is fine you could be one of those rare genetically gifted individuals who can eat anything and suffer no ill effects.&quot;

I&#039;m not 80. I&#039;m in my 70s (i.e., 8th decade). And while it may be my genes, I highly doubt it, considering that I lost my father to a heart attack (when he was 63) and my mother to a heart attack (caused by a stroke) when she was 56.

&quot;But despite all this, even if animal foods were the healthiest diet for humans, eating them is simply not sustainable for much longer.&quot;

Why not? Watch this video:

http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change

You sound like you come from the Paul Erhlich school, too. And that&#039;s just one example of why we almost certainly have more land than we&#039;ll ever need, if we&#039;d only use it intelligently. Add in the fact that the rate of global population growth is dramatically (and has been) slowing down, and there is no &quot;population bomb.&quot;  That&#039;s a myth.

http://overpopulationisamyth.com/content/episode-5-7-billion-people-will-everyone-please-relax

&quot;You are not built to eat meat.&quot;

Of course we are! We&#039;re omnivores. In fact, our early ancestors had virtually no tooth decay. It wasn&#039;t until the advent of the agricultural age that our health (and teeth) began to suffer.

&quot;You have no teeth to kill, no claws, not anything to kill other animals with&#039;

What we do have is a very large brain, and that&#039;s what made us the apex predator that we still are. We make/use tools. We work as a team. That&#039;s how we evolved.

&quot;The fact that you have the technology to kill doesn’t justify the fact of murder or consumption of other living beings.&quot;

Oh, geez.  Here we go again. Insulting my beliefs. What is it about you plant-eaters that compels you (almost all of you!) to constantly proselytize and insult those who disagree with you?  I have a hunch why that is. It&#039;s because you&#039;re not eating enough animal fat! :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe- if you made it to age 80 and your health is fine you could be one of those rare genetically gifted individuals who can eat anything and suffer no ill effects. I had an uncle to smoked, drank, ate meat+ cheese + crap and never exercised. He made it to age 88 but I think his last 4 years he was just &quot;existing&quot; &amp; not really enjoying his life. Another uncle made to age 96. Ate terrible, drank a little, did not smoke and played golf and walked until about age 90. His last 5 years he was miserable. I really don&#039;t care to live past age 85. Mostly I want to feel good and be able to do for myself all the time I am on earth.

Eating meat displaces nutrients. Cutting out animal-products makes more room in your diet for fruits and vegetables—a goal that most people fail to meet.

Meat contains NO fiber, NO phytochemicals, and very little antioxidants. Phytochemicals are angiogensis inhibitors slowing or stopping the process of a cell becoming cancerous. Antioxidants clean away free radicals. And you don&#039;t have to worry about IGF-1 when you eat plants. We all need to eat more fruits and vegetables, as many as we can.

Excess protein fuels cancer. Excess protein is hard on the kidneys. Excess protein leaches calcium out of your bones (which is why US has high levels of osteoporosis). Excess protein causes inflammation. All facts - Google if you don&#039;t believe me.

But despite all this, even if animal foods were the healthiest diet for humans, eating them is simply not sustainable for much longer. On a per calorie basis, they require over ten times as much land, water and energy as a plant-based diet. If everyone ate the way we do in the USA, we’d need two planet Earths to feed us all and we only have ONE. ONE DAY eating meat will be regarded as something as disgusting as smoking is now. One day!


You are not built to eat meat. You have no teeth to kill, no claws, not anything to kill other animals with. Nature has not made you a natural killer-meat eater, Your organs aren&#039;t built to consume meat and your body hasn&#039;t been made to hunt. The fact that you have the technology to kill doesn&#039;t justify the fact of murder or consumption of other living beings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shelley, regarding the Okinawans. I was basically sharing my own experience with actual Okinawans. I was stationed there for a short time. I knew many Okinawans. And the Okinawans I came in touch with ate fish virtually every day. And frequently pork. And, yes, veggies. They&#039;re reputed to be one of the healthiest populations, so I was trying to show the contradiction between your claim that fish is supposedly bad for us, with the real-world experience of actual Okinawans.

Actually, I think the main reasons they live so long are basically their genetics, their culture, their relaxed lifestyle, and their low levels of stress. Not necessarily their diet. Mañana may be a Spanish word, but I think they borrowed it from the Okinawans.

If you have good experience following Dr. McDougall&#039;s diet (I&#039;m very familiar with what it entails, and I just don&#039;t agree with it, I also don&#039;t do well on carbs), then, by all means, hold a steady course. That&#039;s precisely what I&#039;m doing. I&#039;ve found something that works for me, so I&#039;m sticking to it, too. My health profiles are all excellent. I&#039;ve never felt so good. So why would I change course?  Why would you change course? The short answer is, we wouldn&#039;t.

&quot;Do you think it is &#039;OK&#039;to injure your endothelial cells “in moderation”? I don’t I am over age 50 and want to protect my health.&quot;

I agree with you on that point. But eating large amounts of sugar can injure them, too. Which is another reason why I avoid bread, pasta, too many other carbs, etc.

I&#039;m in my 8th decade (I still can&#039;t believe I&#039;ve made it this far) and also want to keep on keeping on. 

Regarding a better scientific study: It&#039;s being done. By NuSi.

http://nusi.org/

They aren&#039;t trying to &quot;validate&quot; a plant diet.  They&#039;re just going where the science takes them. Let&#039;s hope they finally get it right, or whether there even is a &quot;right&quot; answer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is correct that there is no study or research that definitively shows that eating a small amount of animal products or oils is significantly more damaging to long term health than eating none. No one can successfully argue on that point. I do tend to agree that eating a small amount of either over the course of a lifetime is probably a reasonably safe thing to do and still be able to live healthy &amp; to a ripe old age. We have proof of that in several cultures. By the way Joe- the Okinawans do not eat fish EVERY single day. They eat a lot of sweet potatoes and veggies and occasional fish.
The people on the Mc Dougall way of eating know oil &amp; animal  foods carry some risk. Where the line occurs as to when it becomes an unacceptable risk is going to be different for everyone. Just as the number of cigarettes smoked over a certain time period will affect each of us differently so will the amount of animal products and added oils. Do you think it is &quot;OK&quot;to injure your endothelial cells &quot;in moderation&quot;? I don&#039;t I am over age 50 and want to protect my health.

The forums on drmcdougall.com exist to explain and promote Dr. McDougalls viewpoint which is to eliminate those items from your diet as much as possible.  Good people choose to eat meat, dairy and added oils everyday. Dr. McDougall would be the first to acknowledge this. But his position, and the idea he wishes to convey, is to try to eliminate these risks as much as humanly possible. If you go to a McDougall event you will be served food that matches those ideals. He will not endorse consuming small amounts of animal products or oil. His goal, expounded on through his website, is the BEST diet, not an &quot;ok&quot; diet. It&#039;s the maximum healing diet, not a diet designed to be just adequate. Many of us appreciate that and make our dietary choices on that basis. Others feel they have little risk in consuming small amounts of these items and make that their dietary lifestyle. Both might be fine but the forum and the rest of the mc dougall website are there to reinforce the idea that these items are not necessary to good health and do carry risks. We will all ultimately make the decisions we feel are the best for ourselves. Those decisions will be different for each of us.

We all know there will NEVER be a large research study to demonstrate the validity of the plant diet to minimize risk factors to disease.  just who would fund the research at the universities? The farmers ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I worked on a livestock farm in the past and I presently work on an organic vegetable farm. Even though we are small-scale and minimal till- we harvest practically everything by hand, and never use a combine- STILL, I (unintentionally) kill more animals and critters every year growing vegetables than I ever did on the livestock operation. 

You can&#039;t grow plants without animals and you can&#039;t grow animals without plants. It is a cycle, believe it or not. 

Furthermore, most of the animals you hold so dear would not be around today without the farmers who grow them. Vegans certainly aren&#039;t doing much to preserve heritage breed pigs. 

Everything is alive. And you have to consume living things to be nourished. 

Oh, and eggs are quite good for ye. It sounds like you might just be afraid of the color yellow (butter, yolks, tallow). It is one of the louder ones, isn&#039;t it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I&#039;ve done my own calculations. Based on what I&#039;ve seen with my own eyes. And the biggest difference I can see about the way you eat and the way I eat, is that there really is no difference in the amount of carnage. Sentient animals die in the process. By the millions. That&#039;s a fact. But the animals I&#039;m responsible for at least get eaten in the end. Not so, yours, although some do get eaten by predators and scavengers.

Your view, that animals have the same rights as humans, is essentially a religion (in my opinion). A form of animism, if you will. I believe they have only the rights we grant them. Period. Which of course are open for discussion. I firmly believe, though, that they deserve to be killed (and raised) in the most humane way possible or feasible (so they can enjoy life, too!). And if I were an animal, I&#039;d rather be quickly dispatched by a bolt gun than mutilated by a combine or tractor, and left to die in a field slowly. And painfully. 

Nota bene: Allan Savory has written about a way to feed all of the world&#039;s hungry, and then some, by raising cattle and eliminating desertification at the same time (which would also affect the climate in a positive way). Roughly, it entails letting the cows basically raise themselves. The only human involvement would be to keep them moving, so that the grasslands (after being consumed) get a chance to revive and then thrive. Much like the bison once did in America. Millions of starving African kids, for example (as this was to be an African project) would then have access to all the protein they could handle, the deserts would come back to life, and there would also be a positive effect on the climate. My religion, unlike yours, Alex, puts the lives and sufferings of those African children, and others, ahead of those of animals. Yes, it&#039;s a &quot;mystical principle,&quot; but it&#039;s also based on sound reasoning.

PS: I look forward to the day when scientists are able to prove that plants are sentient beings, too.

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, Gaverick Mathany has done the calculations. You can read about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethik.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/inst_ethik_wiss_dialog/Matheny__G._2003_Defense_of_Veg__in_J._Agric_Ethics.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (Matheny, G (2003). &quot;Least Harm: A Defense of Vegetarianism from Steven Davis&#039;s Omnivorous Proposal&quot;. &lt;i&gt;Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics&lt;/i&gt; 16 (5): 505–511.)

I do agree with what you wrote further above (&quot;...enjoy your life! You only get one&quot;).  But in my view, the word &quot;your&quot; is extended to include non-human animals.

You can read about it <a href="https://ethik.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/inst_ethik_wiss_dialog/Matheny__G._2003_Defense_of_Veg__in_J._Agric_Ethics.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> (Matheny, G (2003). &#8220;Least Harm: A Defense of Vegetarianism from Steven Davis&#8217;s Omnivorous Proposal&#8221;. <i>Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics</i> 16 (5): 505–511.)</p>
<p>I do agree with what you wrote further above (&#8220;&#8230;enjoy your life! You only get one&#8221;).  But in my view, the word &#8220;your&#8221; is extended to include non-human animals.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex:

&quot;Briefly, even if it’s true that lots of animals are killed as a result of growing plants, 

Of course it&#039;s true! I&#039;ve seen the carnage with my own eyes. Have you ever even been on a farm? And it only takes a quick google search to see that your debunking has been debunked many times.

&quot;it’s still better to eat plants than animals, because raising meat is a very inefficient process (e.g., you have to feed a lot of plant matter to a cow to produce a small amount of beef).&quot;

So, I&#039;m supposed to stop eating the tastiest, most nutrient dense foods on the planet, because it&#039;s more &quot;efficient&quot; to eat plants? Wow. Wouldn&#039;t it be even more &quot;efficient&quot; to just stop eating altogether? I kind of think that&#039;s where you&#039;re heading, Alex, with all due respect. Right down Paul Erhlich Lane.

Really, Alex, it&#039;s become a religious experience for you, I can see that now. And I do respect it. Up to the point of your side condemning or insulting those of us who don&#039;t share those religious beliefs. And then I lose all respect for it. I already have a religion, my friend, it&#039;s been around for over two millenia now, and it meets all my needs. If yours meets all your needs, then good on ya. But lighten up on the proselytizing, okay?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, I&#039;m quite familiar with your argument.  It&#039;s debunked here:

http://animalplace.org/1newweb/number.html

Briefly, even if it&#039;s true that lots of animals are killed as a result of growing plants, it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; better to eat plants than animals, because raising meat is a very inefficient process (e.g., you have to feed a lot of plant matter to a cow to produce a small amount of beef).

I do see a big difference.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#039;t eat the way I eat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, you&#039;re entitled to your beliefs. And I do respect them.  I just hope that you will respect the beliefs of those who do not agree with you.

You say it&#039;s wrong to inflict unnecessary harm on sentient creatures. But have you ever walked behind a farm combine in the field? I have. You should try it once. It&#039;s pretty gory. Farm combines kill millions (perhaps billions) of animals each year in the harvesting of crops. Farming also eliminates the habitats of millions (perhaps billions) more (in the preparation of farm fields), resulting in even more animal dislocations and death.

I would never think to accuse vegetarians or vegans of &quot;inflicting unnecessary harm on all those sentient creatures&quot; in the fields. Sometimes your side sounds harshly judgmental, don&#039;t you think? Frankly, I don&#039;t see much difference. Do you?]]></description>
