		<description><![CDATA[That reminds me... Seth, did you see the club foot piece on Morning Edition this week?

It&#039;s the classic story-line of motivated parents empowered by information sharing made possible by the internet up-ending the highly-invasive (and highly lucrative) surgical status quo, er, standard of care with a 50 year-old non-invasive technique developed by a country doc in fly-over country.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/01/27/265254533/how-parents-and-the-internet-transformed-clubfoot-treatment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How Parents and the Internet Transformed Clubfoot Treatment&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. Yes, I did see it and put it in an upcoming Assorted Links.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d find the scoliosis treatment article more credible if they showed before and after x-rays.  Less pain and easier breathing are great but what is the actual long-term prognosis, especially if the curvature is severe.  My daughter had the rods put in her back about 10 years ago and has done extremely well since - very active and no pain.  She only has some limits in flexibility such as yoga or dance moves.  If there had been another option at the time I would have pursued it but we were told her curvature was one that would continue to increase as she aged (most scoliosis doesn&#039;t progress after the child hits puberty, she was one of the unlucky ones that did).]]></description>
