		<description><![CDATA[If I could, I would have a study conducted with smokers of all &quot;flavors&quot; - cloves, pot, tobacco (those seem to be the most popular / quasi-legal ones) and see what happens.  My guess is that smoke is the culprit.  I think having all varieties of &quot;common&quot; smoke in the study would would lead to a more definitive conclusion.

Thanks, Heisenbug.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[William,

It&#039;s a good question. Unfortunately, the study did not look into that, so we do not know. But as I mention in the original post, tobacco smoke has been shown to directly introduce pathogenic bacteria &amp; their endotoxins into smokers. So that would suggest it is not, in fact, the nicotine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So if smoking is the best lifestyle predictor, what could we learn if we looked at the people who smoke for years and never get heart disease - what is it about them that protects the heart?  The first example that I can think of is a family friend who recently died, in his 90s and active but also still smoking.  And he is not the only one I have known.

		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

I forgot to address the last part of your comment. 

&quot;I’d say it’s a fair bet the increased heart rate and blood pressure inflict most of the damage.&quot;

You don&#039;t mention how, or what mechanism, but I&#039;ll assume you are referring to nicotine inducing those affects.

Pipe-smoking exposes smokers to far less nicotine, yet has not been found to be any safer:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20952559

Nicotine patches do not contribute to arrhythmia or ischemia:

		<description><![CDATA[Andy,

The research you are referring to is outdated.

In fact, if you read the blog posts where I talk about this, you will see that the research indicates the opposite of what you say, and figures prominently in the case that&#039;s being made.

I&#039;d be interested to see whatever UC study you are referring to. IBD and microbiota is pretty complicated, but most of what I&#039;ve seen involves a reduction in the butyrate-producing Clostridia (ie, Firmicutes), which is a big part of the microbial pattern I&#039;ve documented.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Seth, for leading me to that initial insight. I put it in my back pocket, and forgot it was there.

I do think there must be protective factors when it comes to smoking. And not just for heart disease. But there just isn&#039;t much fiber/cancer research out there, probably because it isn&#039;t intuitive the way it is with heart disease. Colorectal cancer being the only exception, for obvious reasons. No one cares about the microbial link, so the disease has to have a clear &amp; intuitive dietary connection to merit fiber research. But there is some data to at least raise suspicion:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1851150

&quot;Of the seven case-control studies, which evaluated the relationship between the fiber-rich diet and breast cancer, six demonstrated an inverse association. For cancers of the esophagus, mouth, pharynx, stomach, rectum, endometrium, and ovary, there are only a limited number of studies, most showing a protective effect from eating a diet high in fiber-containing foods.&quot;

But we can always start from the other end -- the microbiome/cancer link. A decent amount there:

http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v13/n11/abs/nrc3610.html

And since we know fermentable fiber is a (if not THE) major modulator of the microbiome, I think there&#039;s enough for a similar inquiry.]]></description>

Quitting smoking is associated with an increase in phylum firmicutes bacteria(often associated with, obesity heart disease and T2D). Smoking is associated with an increase in bacteroides recently famous because they promote leanness. 

Trying to dig up a study where smoking was associated with increased bacterial diversity in UC patients especially in byutrate producing groups and nicotine patches reduced occurrence of flare ups.

I&#039;d say it&#039;s a fair bet the increased heart rate and blood pressure inflict most of the damage.]]></description>
