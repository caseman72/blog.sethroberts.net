		<description><![CDATA[This came out of left field! From the headline, it seems like you expect his sacking, but there&#039;s no reference to anything recent that might justify it, or even what prompted you to write it. 

I went hunting through archives, and it was 2011 when you last had a post in him, so this one, failing to include any reference to the background of your previous posts, and with no actual update material in it, just makes you look as though you have some kind of vendetta going. Consider you previously made mention of comments by his lawyer, did you really expect that an institution like Harvard would risk drawing attention by turfing him out without very good cause?

You&#039;re treading a very slippery slope here. Imagine the consequences if anyone&#039;s job could be put at risk by someone in the public domain calling for their head, and more so, over things that are long since past and which, presumably, they&#039;ve given no indication is still their mode of practice? 

I fail to see any actual point for this article, I&#039;m afraid, and it comes across as particularly emotionally driven. Not what I&#039;ve come to expect of you, Seth.

&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: For money and/or career, Biederman has used -- and is still using -- his enormously powerful position to cause many thousands of sick helpless children to be given drugs that almost certainly damage them. He deserves this post and much more.&lt;/strong&gt;

Do you guys have any good ideas in terms of leading a campaign against this guy?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We open our newspapers and see some monster who murdered a child and have a hard time understanding it. But the Biedermans out there are the real monsters. They have destroyed  many hundreds and thousands of lives by setting a chain of events in kids&#039; lives that lead to homelessness, institutionalization, suicide, or just a miserable, unhealthy life.

I always wonder how people like this live with themselves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alas, being a famous university implies no absence of crooks, conmen, spivs, and chaps who sail close to the wind.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No one word (such as &quot;crook&quot;) does justice here. Because of Biederman&#039;s great influence, the good he might have done (but doesn&#039;t do), the targeting of young children, the bad health of these children to begin with, the involvement of drug ingestion . . . the noxiousness of it is monumental.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Biederman and his cohorts brought great harm on countless children and adolescents.  Children who are diagnosed with pediatric bipolar disorder usually receive powerful psychiatric drugs that allegedly treat their &quot;illness&quot;.  In reality, the drugs cause brain damage that actually worsens the long-term outcome for those children.  Robert Whitaker lays out the evidence in his outstanding book, &lt;i&gt;Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America&lt;/i&gt; (the Amazon link is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Epidemic-Bullets-Psychiatric-Astonishing-ebook/dp/B0036S4EGE/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  Anyone who takes psychiatric drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, Ritalin, etc.) -- or has a loved one who takes such drugs -- should read the book.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I hope someone writes a book about Biederman and his enablers.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
