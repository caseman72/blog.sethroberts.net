		<description><![CDATA[Having studied at Berkeley and now working there as an instructor, the quality of teaching and uh &quot;civility&quot; of the professor seems quite variable. However, I will say that in 7 years I&#039;ve been involved with the university, I never had the impression it&#039;s as bad as some of those stories make it seem. Nor have I noticed a significant difference in this matter between Berkeley and the few elite, research-heavy, private universities I&#039;m familiar with (both east and west coast).

Perhaps it has something to do with a particular department(s)?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: My direct experience is in the psychology department. However, antipathy toward teaching undergraduates seemed to me to be universal. In 25 years as a Berkeley professor, I don&#039;t think I ever heard another professor -- including me -- say something positive about teaching undergraduates. I heard lots of negative comments. In contrast, people often liked teaching graduate courses.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;assigning grades but not telling students&quot;

Haha. Funny that&#039;s what you bring up. A friend liked to joke... sleeping with students was frowned upon and would result in a letter of reprimand; telling students their grades meant immediate termination.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;assigning grades but not telling students what they are&quot;: rather different from my experience.  Not only were my, and everyone else&#039;s, grades published on notice boards, our Finals results appeared in the better sort of newspapers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you&#039;re a Reedie? Nice. I&#039;m not one myself, but there&#039;s a few of them that end up never leaving town. Generally, I&#039;ve found them to be sharp, interesting people and a lot of fun to be around.

I&#039;m guess I&#039;m not overly surprised you&#039;d have gone there, nor overly surprised you didn&#039;t finish there -- or did you?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I finished there. When I was there, Reed had its own version of mistreating undergrads -- assigning grades but not telling students what they are. School policy.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One professor said that professors avoided undergrads to avoid the adulation of students. This was at U of Chicago, that may be  something unique to Chicago. It made a certain sense to me, though; that is a responsibility most professors don&#039;t want (and some do, of course).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I much enjoyed supervising final year undergraduates on research projects - principally experimental, sometimes computational.  They are cleverer and more interesting than you would think if all you did was lecture them.  Especially if you lectured past them rather than at them. 

On the other hand I remember with horror the twerps who taught me freshman physics.  Could I face spending another three years in their company?  I could not.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I liked my undergraduate professors, at Caltech, College of Marin, and Reed, except for the College of Marin French teacher who wouldn&#039;t let us, his students, speak French because we mispronounced it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
