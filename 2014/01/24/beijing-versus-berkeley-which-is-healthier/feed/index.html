		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I have yet to discover just where you stand on the subject of astrology, or better yet, the cycles of life (which are never out of sync with the solar system!).  But you must be aware that cycles accompany most parts of our lives.

I have no doubt that a competent &#039;astrologer&#039; would reveal that some important cycles were involved in your personal ups and downs.   If you dig deeper into your own awareness of self, you may discover that many things in your life were in a state of flux, change, reorganization, etc. about the time your dots were dancing.

Sleepless nights in my life can be triggered by many events, of course, but no one causative suspect can ever be relied on to promote such.  It takes several of them to produce the effect, and that generally occurs when there are negative aspects in the solar clock to the position of Uranus in my birth chart.

Your reaction time will be affected seriously at times when Mercury is in a challenging position to your birth positions.   In my experience, the &#039;mood&#039; of the solar system is the only causative factor that reliably is indicated in any situation.

Do the planets compel us?  Not necessarily, but we certainly respond to their transits and we cannot escape their influence, only adapt to it.  Try getting your daylight off sync to the real one.  Try getting summer in California to be winter, just for your own purposes.  It will not work.   Even being on the moon is no escape, it is only a variation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[seth, i&#039;ve played dozens of video games in my life, many of them nothing but elaborate &#039;&#039;choice reaction time tests&#039;&#039;, and skill plateaus followed by gradual improvement are common all along the skill spectrum. you cannot say with any confidence that practice effects have stopped.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Going from Beijing to Berkeley I slowed down. That cannot be due to a practice effect. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks like classic training effect to me: your reaction times are getting faster because you take the test so often. What, exactly, is the test?  Did you make some kind of adjustment back in late 2012?

I don&#039;t have self data like yours about reaction times, but my Zeo data (several years, across both countries) shows no difference at all.  Eg. if REM is a proxy for stimulation or something, I see no patterns.

FWIW, anecdotally I feel more &quot;alive&quot; when I&#039;m in Beijing: Lots of new, interesting stimulii everywhere, regular interaction with unusual people from different backgrounds.  In the US I&#039;m just another guy.  It&#039;d be interesting if that anecdotal sense was quantifiable.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The practice effect stopped long before this data was collected. The test is a choice reaction time test. It was constant over the period shown.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My first thought was perhaps the impact of being in new surroundings (e.g. Beijing) would cause an excitability that would positively impact reaction times whereas Berkeley, even after a stint away, is old-hat.  Returning to Beijing a second time would be less impactful as the &quot;newness&quot; would not be present the second time around.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;d spent a lot of time in Beijing before this data.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Tom Passin, your results (with the exception of the weirdness present in the Beijing &quot;run-in&quot; period) would seem to be consistent with a continuous improvement from Berkeley period through second Beijing period.  Also, wondering if you use the same computer in both locations?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I use the same computer in both locations. Had I used a different loess parameter, the sharp change from Berkeley to Beijing would have been clearer.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe it&#039;s stress. Whether you think about it or not, maybe Beijing is less stressful than Berkeley.

I find that sitting on the beach is very relaxing, much more so than any other &quot;natural&quot; environment (i.e. parks, mountains, desert), and usually take a little nap. The ocean has high levels of magnesium and as waves break on the shore their magnesium filled mist is carried on shore by the sea breeze where it is easily inhaled.

		<description><![CDATA[To me the data look like one smooth curve that has not got much to do with location.  The reaction times rose during the first Beijing trip, picked up in Berkeley at about the same level, then began a long steady decline that continued through your entire Berkeley residence and through the next Beijing one.  I don&#039;t see a discontinuity when you went back to Beijing.

With that much scatter in the data, you shouldn&#039;t pay much attention to details like wiggles and shelves in the smoothed data, even if you use LOWESS smoothing.  Or use a much wider smoothing window.  

To me, the simplest explanation would be that when you got back to Berkeley, you started doing something that has a small but long term beneficial effect.  The improvements are still playing out.  Judging by the data, the rate of improvement appears to be declining - perhaps the effect has nearly run its course.

Now what is causing the change, if anything?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The Berkeley Beijing discontinuity is somewhat hidden by the fitted lines which average over large periods of time. Look at the points closely and you will see it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe because Beijing is otherwise so unhealthy you take extra precautions there whereas in Berkeley, where you would perceive your day-to-day environment as relatively benign, you aren&#039;t as careful about other potentially negative environmental exposures to toxins?  Your water choice could be one of those 0.5% things that add up over a number of different items to become statistically significant.

I know when I go back to the US, I relax on the bad stuff that I would otherwise not eat in Hong Kong, where I pay more attention.  Part of it is some home cooked meals from my childhood contain ingredients I don&#039;t eat now, for example.  Part of it is that in the US, Taco Bell is right there and calls my name, but in all of Asia there is no such temptation.]]></description>
