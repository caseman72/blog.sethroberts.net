		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you ask the eternal question:  which one….. egg or chicken?  Which is the most important, the flintlock or the flint?  In truth, it is neither, but both.  Which gender is the most important, the male or the female?   The answer is the same:  it takes the pair of them to make it tick.

Individuals can come up with innovative ideas, revolutionary ideas even and great solutions to problems, and they are the active entity.  The establishments act as the stone, the flint, and the unmovable.  It is the spark that they two emit that fires the cannon.

Individuals whether professional or one of the people can come up with this new perception, but until enough of ‘we the people’ embrace it, it will not influence the establishments.  The establishments are self-preserving and unmovable, whereas individuals are self-sacrificing and irresistible.

  Establishments will not embrace any innovation that threatens their status or the equilibrium of the ‘economy’ or the interest of the masses collectively.  They are far more likely to sacrifice individuals as collateral damage just to maintain the status quo.

The evolution of the round earth concept is my favorite example of how new perceptions take forever to be incorporated into the establishments.  The unfortunate part of it all is when professionals come up with good ideas that work for individuals but would topple the society were those ideas to be implemented, they are faced with choosing between their own wellbeing and the advancement of the new idea.  A cancer cure (for example) would be a disaster right now for our economy.   

The older an establishment is, the bigger it is and the more powerful, the more is at stake should it be made redundant by newer and more workable ideas.  These new ideas can come from both professionals and common people.   Ironically, the professional has more to lose should he postulate something that is against the interest of his power base, so the wise ones often look to see which side of their bread the butter is on.

We the people have nothing to lose, so we speak our own truth regardless of how it may suit the establishments.   As an example, I may postulate that the earth is still growing, as it reduces the light from the sun to matter in the form of minerals, which would be quite in keeping with Einstein’s theory.   A professional is far less likely to postulate such a foreign idea, yet Jules Verne, (a playwright) could suggest space travel, regardless of how long it took Tsiolkovsky and his like to bring it into the realm of serious human endeavor.  Jesus taught the people in parables.  Lewis Carol hid his 12 place decimal system in a children’s book.  

Any new idea that is perceived to be a threat to the establishments will only fly when enough laymen endorse it.   It could be suggested that until establishments yield we the people cannot progress (as a class).  As individuals, however, we may progress and influence other individuals. Individuals are at liberty to change.  Sufficient numbers of ‘us’ can change establishments.  Establishments are loathe to change except in favor of themselves and their influence and control over the masses.

By what measuring unit, standard or specification will we be able to know if the world improves?  Isn’t this present moment the most perfect one?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe it&#039;s time for a list of self-experimentation friendly doctors.

There&#039;s already a list of fat-friendly health professionals: http://fatfriendlydocs.com/ -- it exists because many health professionals tell fat people to lose weight instead of paying attention to actual symptoms.

Actually, what I&#039;d like is a list of health professionals who listen and think, but that&#039;s a little harder to define and publicize.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s a good idea. If someone sends me as little as one name I will post it. I would like to find a doctor near Berkeley who will approve lab tests that I will pay for.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hsu&#039;s comments should be accepted as the same platitudes that are offered to every graduating high school or college class regardless of its quality.  &quot;You are the future!!!!&quot;  The obvious clue is he told them they would advance science out of pure motives rather than for profit or gain.  While a good launching point for this blog, it&#039;s mostly innocent as a speech of its type.

It certainly would be less inspiring to tell them they are insignificant cogs in a wheel and will probably not perform their chosen profession correctly, which is your assertion will happen.  That said, you are probably correct about most of the promotees addressed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got enormous and unexpected benefits from trying the experiment of eliminating wheat from my diet, and apart from the health benefits, it made me aware of some of my own biases, and that they are correctible, at least somewhat, if I am willing to self-test.  I emphatically did not WANT wheat to be a problem, and it was only a nasty symptom that motivated me to try the experiment of eliminating it.  I was somewhat dismayed by my discovery, though relieved, too.  

If I had been more attuned to self-testing earlier, for instance if I had learned self-testing as I learned about logical fallacy or other useful thinking methods, I might have approached many things in life with a view to self-experimentation and testing.  That might have included testing things where I felt something that made the prospect of testing unpleasant.

Your point about people being dismissive is something that I did to myself in many arenas.  I think - suspect, really - that an attitude that included testing might have led me down some interesting paths.  

The question is how to test that, I suppose?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, I don&#039;t think there is any need to test whether self-testing (doing it, learning about it) is beneficial. It obviously is. I think of literacy. It is obviously beneficial, we don&#039;t need to wonder whether it is. Literacy and self-testing both give a wider relatively-unfiltered view of the world. Literacy shows the outside world, self-testing the inside world.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It seems to me that apart from the value of self-testing to discover new health things, you are actually promoting a kind of heuristic for living that can apply to any arena, a heuristic that is as valuable as learning valid rules of inference.&quot;

I have tried to do experiments in other areas but only in the area of health have I found my experiments paid off. For example, I used to measure the mileage of my scooter. These measurements were never very helpful, although I did them for years. On the other hand my self-testing has helped me in other ways, as you say. 

1. It has made me very skeptical of experts (because what they said was contradicted by what I directly observed) and I agree that such skepticism is at least a good starting point for understanding many things. For example, journalists gain nothing by being so credulous about what scientists claim. I recently gave the example of James Fallows and Eric Lander. 

2. I believe that if professional scientists did the self-testing I advocate they would learn better how to do their jobs, and that would help the rest of us. 

3. Another general lesson from self-tracking and self-experimentation is not to be dismissive. To realize you can learn from small things and imperfect things. This isn&#039;t taught -- if anything, the opposite is taught. Lots of smart people are dismissive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I get your larger point, but I think the stuff you wrote about weight loss and AS has to be the most revolutionary.  The rest of the medical establishment has made basically zero progress on obesity, and you discovered something significant and actually cured a bunch of people.  Not surprisingly, academics refuse to take it seriously.

So here you have a major health crisis, ONE person put a dent in the problem, and none of the authorities want to acknowledge it.  

[Btw, any hints for what what to do if the AS effect from ELOO fades over time?]

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I wish I could say I &quot;put a dent in the problem&quot; but I am afraid hundreds of thousands of people doing the Shangri-La Diet is not many compared to hundreds of millions of obese people. Maybe someday. I think the obesity epidemic is partly driven by a depression epidemic -- that is the more serious problem. If you are depressed you eat certain foods to feel better and they are more fattening than other foods. I do have a new idea about what causes depression (lack of morning faces) but I have yet to write a book about it. 

If the AS effect from ELOO fades -- and even if it doesn&#039;t -- I suggest you switch to nose-clipping other sources of fat, such as flaxseed oil and butter.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with gwern that experts and non-experts should be treated in the same way and subjected to the same level of scrutiny. I have benefited quite a bit from gwern&#039;s research into melatonin and I have found melatonin helpful for improving my sleep. 

I have yet to find Seth&#039;s ideas equally useful, but I do appreciate them as stimulating and I did give them a fair try and continue experimenting with them. 

It is not particularly hard, though, to find people who make their careers or build online reputations by attacking the ideas of others without giving them due consideration. The Internet made it quite easy for such people to flourish. Some of them may have hidden agendas, which you will not find out unless you do some extra digging.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that apart from the value of self-testing to discover new health things, you are actually promoting a kind of heuristic for living that can apply to any arena, a heuristic that is as valuable as learning valid rules of inference.  Part of what self-testing does is help us question our own convictions in a way that can produce evidence of an apt answer one way or another.  Simply committing to self-testing, to mastering it, and then learning from doing it alters the way we think, not just our behavior in a particular domain.  ‘Learning from really doing it’ is as much an education and testing or our own feelings as it is some objective test of the non-subjective world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mathematics of happiness debunked by Nick Brown

The astonishing story of Nick Brown, the British man who began a part-time psychology course in his 50s – and ended up taking on America&#039;s academic establishment

Who was he to doubt the work of a leading professional which had been accepted by the psychological elite? 

&quot;The answer,&quot; says Brown when I meet him in a north London cafe, &quot;is because that&#039;s how it always happens. Look at whistleblower culture. If you want to be a whistleblower you have to be prepared to lose your job. I&#039;m able to do what I&#039;m doing here because I&#039;m nobody. I don&#039;t have to keep any academics happy. I don&#039;t have to think about the possible consequences of my actions for people I might admire personally who may have based their work on this and they end up looking silly. There are 160,000 psychologists in America and they&#039;ve got mortgages. I&#039;ve got the necessary degree of total independence.&quot;

&quot;Not many psychologists are very good at math,&quot; says Brown. &quot;Not many psychologists are even good at the math and statistics you have to do as a psychologist. Typically you&#039;ll have a couple of people in the department who understand it. Most psychologists are not capable of organizing a quantitative study. &quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:

I’d just like to point out what you had mentioned earlier on the dangers of mercury fillings. I’m studying for my USMLE Step 1 medical board exam and I noticed my memory wasn’t nearly as sharp as it used to be. At the same time my doctor diagnosed me with hypothyroidism; he said it was Hashimoto’s without even running labs. I paid for my own labs and my tests came back negative for anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, which should be present with Hashimoto&#039;s.

Around this time, I read your earlier post how your memory improved after removing your mercury fillings. Also in that same post one of your readers had cited some pubmed studies linking mercury fillings to thyroid problems.

I decided to have my fillings removed by a dentist knowledgeable in doing so since you have to remove them carefully. It’s been only 5 days since I had them removed but I already feel sharper, as if the brain fog has lifted. I’m detoxing now with chlorella, cumin, and water high in silicon (Fiji).

So, I was able to better my health thanks to one of your blog posts. My own doctor didn’t have the time or inclination to think deeply about my problems, and had the arrogance to diagnose Hashimoto’s without even running labs. I will certainly not go back to him. The problem is finding a doctor who is open to alternative remedies and is current with the latest research. As I told my parents, I can’t imagine most doctors after a long day’s work wanting to come home and sit in front of pubmed for 2-3 hours.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: A doctor would not need to sit in front of pubmed for 2-3 hours to realize it might be a good idea to order labs. And doctors are supposed to continue their education, which should definitely include looking at recent research.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; (For anyone who dismisses these reports as “anecdotes”, I have one question: What have you discovered?)

So, you can only criticize some music if you&#039;re a musician? You can only criticize research if you&#039;ve published research? You can only criticize a movie if you&#039;ve directed a movie? A classic excuse, but it doesn&#039;t wash: you don&#039;t need to be a farmer to know what bull shit smells like.]]></description>
