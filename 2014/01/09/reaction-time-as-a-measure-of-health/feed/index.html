		<description><![CDATA[Nancy Lebovitz, the distractability and hyperfocus of ADHD are two sides of the same coin: impaired ability to *direct* attention. ADHD is badly named. It&#039;s not really attention deficit; it&#039;s attention-control deficit. It would not surprise me if attention control rose and fell with general brain function.

I wish I had a dime for every friend who&#039;s told me, &quot;My kid doesn&#039;t have ADHD; s/he can focus on a video game for hours on end.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s really interesting. Remember in Eat, Fast where they did the balancing and ruler drop tests? Backs up your thesis (though Mosley did not re-test those measures after the intervention)

What I find fascinating about your RT tests is that they&#039;re sensitive cheap and quick, with lots of longitudinal data. So you use them like a tremor detector. Signal detection. That turns up things like soybeans.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I remember those two tests only vaguely. I will watch it again. I agree, my RT tests are sensitive cheap and quick. And easy. Room for improvement: Less sensitive during learning period, comparisons across people a bit unclear (timing may depend on your computer), not especially accessible, speed/accuracy tradeoff a possible problem.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did not know there was such a strong correlation between overall health and reaction time. That was very interesting. Measuring brain function is certainly easier than measuring your liver function :)

Regarding the RT test, I have a similar question with sam. Have you changed the test from a simple arithmetic test to a digit retyping test?

Previously, I coded another version of your simple arithmetic test. I started experimenting with it but I saw that trying to be fast reduced the accuracy of my results. I accepted a maximum 4 errors in 30 questions for the experiment to be valid. However, there is a significant difference in trying to make zero errors and allowing a margin of four errors. 

In a digit retyping test, I think it maybe possible to be more accurate and reduce the margin of error. In the end, if you spend enough time, it seems to me that simple arithmetic test boils down to a digit retyping test.]]></description>

Or do you have a plain reaction test now?
