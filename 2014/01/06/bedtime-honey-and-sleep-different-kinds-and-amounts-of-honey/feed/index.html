		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you&#039;re still not understanding me. And that&#039;s probably my fault. But I&#039;m game-bred, so I&#039;ll keep trying.

Yes, &quot;I don&#039;t care how the Japanese control their weight.&quot;  But that doesn&#039;t mean that I&#039;ve ignored them. Just like I haven&#039;t ignored all the other populations. The Kitivans, Massai, Inuit, etc.  Heck, I&#039;ve been studying them at length for many years, trying to figure it out. The one thing I have actually learned from all this is: there are many ways to skin a cat! And nobody can really explain why any of them work to keep the pounds off, live healthy lives, etc! And that includes you, Seth!

What I keep saying here is that I have found a way to lose weight, keep it off, and enjoy a healthy and fit life. It&#039;s the only way that worked for me. I tried most of the others and they didn&#039;t work for ME. They obviously have worked for others. But I don&#039;t really care what works for others, I only care about what has, and is, working for me. Yes, it&#039;s a good idea to look at what works for others, if only to figure out why/how something worked. But again, that doesn&#039;t appear to be what we are doing here.

It seems like you&#039;re saying that because the Japanese can eat lots of carbs and stay healthy, I can too.  Well, for the gazillionth time, I CAN&#039;T. I&#039;ve tried doing that. I know what happens to ME.  No, I don&#039;t know why that happens to me, and neither do you know why it doesn&#039;t happen to the Japanese.  So you&#039;re asking me to explain something that you can&#039;t even explain yourself. Is that really fair?

Look, my way (low-carb/paleo) has also worked for countless others who have really given it a try. The internet is littered with similar success stories. Sure, there are failures, too. I have no idea why some fail and some don&#039;t. I do know why certain people I know have failed, and then got back on track. 

I&#039;ve seen many fat Japanese too (and so have you), and can&#039;t explain why they didn&#039;t get the secret memo that apparently tells the Japanese how to stay fit and healthy. Neither can you.

So Seth, I&#039;m not ignoring anything. &quot;My self-experimentation would have gotten nowhere [too] if I didn&#039;t pay great attention to what worked for other people.&quot; I.e., I found a way that worked for me while watching what worked for others. Just like you, Seth!

It just wasn&#039;t the same way. And now that I have, why should I look for yet another way? This way has already made me into a fit and healthy human being. I&#039;m willing to work at the edges, say, by trying a teaspoon of honey at bedtime. I&#039;ve tried that once already, and it didn&#039;t work. I&#039;ll try it again (while avoiding bananas, as we discussed) , and make it a longer trial. Whether it works or not, that little bit of honey at bedtime won&#039;t cause me to substantially jeopardize my usual way of eating. But I&#039;m not going to just cannonball into the deep end of the carb pool. That just ain&#039;t gonna happen. Nosirree Bob.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: &quot;You’re ignoring that there are plenty of examples of people being quite healthy and slim on a high-carb diet. Although the Japanese are not incredibly slim today, they were exceedingly slim as recently as 20 years ago. On a high-carb diet. I have no idea what “contradictions” you are referring to, the slenderness of Japanese was obvious to anyone who visited Japan. As was the fact that they ate lots of rice. Moreover, they stayed thin without weighing themselves daily and adjusting their diet according to what the scale said. Perhaps they were controlling their weight in a better way than you are. I agree, Japan today is different.&quot;

Seth, I really wish you&#039;d stop telling me what I&#039;m ignoring. I have admitted, several times now, that there are people who do fine on a high carb diet.  BUT I&quot;M NOT ONE OF THEM.  That is, I don&#039;t care how the Japanese control their weight. I care about MY WEIGHT, not the Japanese&#039;s.

I was stationed in Japan in the 60s. I saw many fat Japanese.  They ate mostly fish, veggies and fruit (not so different from what I eat. Plus a little rice and tofu. What I noticed most was the very small size of their portions, which appeared to be a cultural thing.

 Kitivans stay thin and healthy eating a lot of carbs.  The Masai stay thin and healthy eating essentially no carbs, just meat and milk. Contradictions, no?

You also seem to think that weighing myself daily is some kind of hassle. It&#039;s not. I also take my BP almost daily. When I exercise, which I do almost daily, I also time myself, count reps, measure distances, etc. Again, they are not hassles to me. They are just a part of my daily routine. No spreadsheet or statistical program necessary!

Why can&#039;t my personal success, doing it my way, be just as relevant as any other person&#039;s way? It&#039;s almost as if you&#039;ve lost faith in your own axiom, i.e., the importance and significance of PERSONAL EXPERIMENTATION, at least when it comes to me.

I just don&#039;t get it.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think it&#039;s a good idea to look at what works for other people, in addition to self-experimentation. My self-experimentation would have gotten nowhere if I didn&#039;t pay great attention to what worked for other people. Nowhere did I say your personal success is irrelevant. Nor do I think that. I&#039;m not ignoring your success, I&#039;m wondering about how ideal it is. And what caused it. Surely those are topics for discussion? Especially because you are doing something very popular (low-carb). I keep bringing up what you&#039;re ignoring because you keep ignoring it (&quot;I don&#039;t care how the Japanese control their weight&quot;) at the same time you say you aren&#039;t ignoring it (&quot;I&#039;m really not ignoring anything&quot;)...forgive me.  For all I know you have a good reason for ignoring how the Japanese control their weight but doing so goes against everything I&#039;ve learned.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FWIW, I went low carb in 2010 &amp; quickly lost about 45 lbs. I stalled at that point, never did lose any more weight although I am well over my target (yes, it&#039;s quite reasonable). I stayed on the diet diligently (using my carb counter) for several more months but no luck. I understand this is fairly common in the low carb community. I continue to control carbs &amp; most of the weight has stayed off, which is nice. But shortly after I stalled (spring 2011) I started experiencing some worrying effects that cannot be explained by anything other than diet as that was the only thing that I had changed. I developed what appeared to be keratosis pilaris on my back, arms &amp; legs that is mostly resolved now that I&#039;ve added back some carbs. My hair also started falling out and it still is. In my experience, a low or controlled carb diet might be one way for some people to lose weight. But it isn&#039;t effective for everyone and can have drawbacks. I agree that there is likely some other mechanism at work. 

Returning to the topic of honey, I&#039;ve been taking a tsp or so nightly of an unpasteurized locally-produced product. Sometimes it improves my sleep and sometimes not so I&#039;m going to experiment with the dose, maybe added yogurt, maybe try fermented, etc. I do find that the almost daily headaches I usually have upon waking are not entirely gone but are much less painful since I started the honey. I&#039;m not particularly patient &amp; often try several things at once, so that might not be what did it, but I&#039;m thankful. 

I also enjoyed the 2013 year in review post. I started chewing xylitol gum the other day &amp; find almost no plaque on my teeth any more. Nice!  I&#039;m giving it more time to see if it helps my mouth &amp; tongue. The dermatologists all have differing diagnoses, of course. I may try spraying some on my head just in case one of them is right &amp; it really is lichen!

I&#039;ve become a big fan of personal experimentation since I started reading this blog. Thanks Seth!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: &quot;I agree, obesity and diabetes are going up in those countries. That doesn’t change the fact that they are a lot slimmer than Americans while eating a high-carb diet. Which they have been doing for a very long time, like a hundred years or more. The high-carb diet is unquestionably not the reason for the increases in diabetes and obesity. It is something about Western foods that is. Or perhaps something else about Westernization (less activity?). All of those countries are eating far more Western foods in recent years. You seem to be ignoring this — it isn’t carbs that are bad, it is something else.&quot;

I&#039;m not really ignoring anything, Seth. There are many contradictions in the literature. Frankly, I haven&#039;t seen that many slim Japanese, for example. And when one controls for things like smoking, there probably isn&#039;t that much difference overall. For every Kitivan there is a Masai. And no one really knows why there are obesity epidemics in those places (my guess is increased SUGAR consumption), as well as in our own backyard. People are busy looking for solutions, but I seem to have found mine. And it doesn&#039;t include sugar.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: &quot;I agree there is a lot to like about that story. As for what’s not to like, I suspect your sleep could be better. Maybe your gut biota could be better — check out the correlation of fiber intake and heart disease if you think this is unimportant. I also wonder when you started eating low-carb. Alex Chernavsky lost lots of weight when he started low carb but around two years later he started gaining it back.&quot;

My gut biota is in very good shape.  I drink some kefir almost every day, and I eat a lot of high-fiber veggies and fruits. I also eat a tablespoon of soluble fiber each day  (in the form of Konsul). You could set your watch by my &quot;movements.&quot;

Fiber is important, but not at the expense of everything else.

I&#039;ve eaten this way for roughly 10 years, Seth. I used to weigh 300 pounds. I weigh about 190 today, and it hasn&#039;t varied by more than 10 pounds either way, since I first got to 190. 190 puts me at a 24.4 BMI.

I&#039;ve had friends with Alex&#039;s experience. Without exception, once they started writing down what they were actually eating, they quickly realized it was no longer low-carb. I usually ask them to consider starting all over again, like in Atkins&#039; Phase 1, and cut carbs way back to 20 grams or less for a few weeks. It has always worked. I&#039;m not saying it always works. For everyone.  I&#039;m saying it has always worked for me, and for the people I know.

Also, though a lot of experts will tell you not to look at the scale everyday, I do. At the same time every day (first thing in the morning).  And what that scale says will dictate how many carbs I eat that day. I nip things in the bud. Again, it works for me.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s good to know, especially about the fiber sources. I am more interested in measuring my gut biota than you seem to be; I want to find out whether there is room for improvement. When you say &quot;it works for me&quot; you seem to be ignoring my point about your sleep. I am not so sure it works for you, in the sense that there is no room for improvement.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

I usually ask them to consider starting all over again, like in Atkins&#8217; Phase 1, and cut carbs way back to 20 grams or less for a few weeks. It has always worked. I&#8217;m not saying it always works. For everyone.  I&#8217;m saying it has always worked for me, and for the people I know.</p>
<p>Also, though a lot of experts will tell you not to look at the scale everyday, I do. At the same time every day (first thing in the morning).  And what that scale says will dictate how many carbs I eat that day. I nip things in the bud. Again, it works for me.</p>
<p><strong>Seth: That&#8217;s good to know, especially about the fiber sources. I am more interested in measuring my gut biota than you seem to be; I want to find out whether there is room for improvement. When you say &#8220;it works for me&#8221; you seem to be ignoring my point about your sleep. I am not so sure it works for you, in the sense that there is no room for improvement.</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: &quot;I increased my carb consumption, which caused me to lose weight.

Life is full of contradictions, my friend. Some people who eat lots of carbs do well, some don&#039;t.  Some people who eat lots of meat do well, some don&#039;t. I can&#039;t explain it. I can&#039;t explain why you lost weight by consuming sugar water, and you probably can&#039;t explain it either.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks to Gina, Joe and Seth for sharing their thoughts and experiences, and for this very interesting discussion. For what it is worth, I believe Gina and Joe are both right.

Gina points to countries, and Seventh-Day Adventists, who eat starchy diets and are healthy.

One possible reason: they do eat a starchy diet, but don&#039;t generally exceed 600 calories a day from starches.

Here is Paul Jaminet and Shou-Ching Jaminet in &quot;Perfect Health Diet&quot;:

&quot;Although the precise magnitude of the various quantities is uncertain, it appears that the body&#039;s natural daily glucose consumption is about 480 calories for brain and nerves, 200 calories for glycoproteins such as hyaluronan and mucin, 100 calories for muscle glycogen and immune, intestinal, and kidney cell use, offset by about 200 calories of glucose produced in the course of fat burning.

For sedentary healthy people, then, the natural carb intake is about 600 carb calories per day.&quot;

These facts inform their diet recommendations. The Jaminets suggest eating:

&quot;About 600 carbohydrate calories per day from about 1 pound of &quot;safe starches&quot; such as sweet potatoes, yams, taro, white rice, sago, tapioca, and potatoes and 1 pound of fruits, berries, and sugary vegetables such as beets and carrots.&quot;

Generally, 600 carb calories works out to 150 g of carbs per day. This is what Joe mentioned above, and what Mark Sisson emphasized in &quot;Primal Blueprint&quot;.

It appears it is ok to eat certain carbs- and indeed might be beneficial to do so. The key is knowing how much: too many and one is likely to gain weight. Many low carb and diet paleo books are really just about helping people find the right amount of carbs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: &quot;I wonder if your low-carb diet hurts your sleep, meaning that a higher-carb diet would give you better sleep.&quot;

Before I started eating low-carb/paleo, I ate like your typical Italian (which I am), and unfortunately resembled Luciano Pavarotti, not Frank Sinatra. And I slept poorly. By poorly, I mean maybe 2-3 hours on a good night. On bad nights, no sleep whatsoever.

&quot;With a good understanding of why low-carb diets produce weight loss, it might be possible to increase how much carbs you eat (to get better sleep) without causing weight gain.&quot;

I sleep pretty well, all things considered, for my age. 7-8 hours on a good night.  5-6 hours on others. Plus a daily nap of ~45 minutes. Most mornings I wake up refreshed, others mornings, not so much. I don&#039;t even know where perfection lives, so I&#039;m not going to spend a lot of time looking for it. I&#039;m not going to sacrifice my current way of eating, my health profiles, etc., just to sleep another hour per night. I understand the health benefits that come from getting a good amount of sleep, but I also understand what happens to my health when I eat too many carbs, get fat, etc.

&quot;A good theory about weight control should be able to greatly reduce the trial and error. When you say “too much starch causes me to gain weight” you may be drawing the wrong conclusion from your experience. Maybe one form of “too much starch” causes weight gain but another form would not.&quot;

Seth, here&#039;s my theory: Find something that works for me, and then stick to it. I like n=1 experiments as much as the next guy, but I also understand the wisdom of not trying to fix things that aren&#039;t broken. I got here by experimenting, by the way. And in my experiments, I discovered that eating copious amounts of pasta, Italian bread, pizza, etc. was going to kill me. So I tried all the popular ways of losing weight and getting fit. None worked very long (especially vegetarianism), or very long. Until I tried eating low-carb. Then the weight came tumbling off. Then I learned about the paleo diet, and changed my low-carb base accordingly. Then came even greater weight loss, plus amazing improvements in all my health profiles. 

What&#039;s not to like?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree there is a lot to like about that story. As for what&#039;s not to like, I suspect your sleep could be better. Maybe your gut biota could be better -- check out the correlation of fiber intake and heart disease if you think this is unimportant. I also wonder when you started eating low-carb. Alex Chernavsky lost lots of weight when he started low carb but around two years later he started gaining it back.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gina, I think if you&#039;ll google a bit, you&#039;ll find that all of those countries are currently experiencing the same problem we are - an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. 

But let me add this. I wouldn&#039;t care if they weren&#039;t. I know what works for me, and what doesn&#039;t work for me. And selfishly, that&#039;s the only diet I really care about. My own. And starches give me a problem. I don&#039;t totally avoid them, but I tread lightly. 

Nota bene: For someone who warns others of heeding dogmatic advice, you seem pretty dogmatic yourself.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, obesity and diabetes are going up in those countries. That doesn&#039;t change the fact that they are a lot slimmer than Americans while eating a high-carb diet. Which they have been doing for a very long time, like a hundred years or more. The high-carb diet is unquestionably not the reason for the increases in diabetes and obesity. It is something about Western foods that is. Or perhaps something else about Westernization (less activity?). All of those countries are eating far more Western foods in recent years. You seem to be ignoring this -- it isn&#039;t carbs that are bad, it is something else.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@daz, I too had written agave nectar off and had even suggested to my sister to stop using it, thanks in part to negative views on fructose from folks like Dr. Lustig. I have tried taking the agave syrup before bedtime a couple times and didn&#039;t notice anything particularly different, though I was already sleeping through the night. 

I did notice that the first time I tried it in a long time that I was surprised by a nice wave of muscle relaxation after taking it that I sometimes get after consuming RF honey. It&#039;s baffling to me, because fructose is supposed to raise lactic acid, not lower it. Does anyone know of a possible cause for this? Perhaps it was coincidence, though I do seem to get a bit of it most times I try it. 

I doubt I&#039;ll add agave nectar to my regular diet, but the early testing has been interesting.

In contrast, brown rice glucose syrup, which I also tested a small amount of after glucose syrup was recommended by a fairly well respected Paleo blogger as the safest carb for carb sensitive people like me (even supposedly safer than &quot;safe starches&quot;), had rapid and rather bad negative effects. It also tasted pretty bad to me.

		<description><![CDATA[Gina, I&#039;d say this:  If a high starch diet allows you to remain thin and fit and healthy, by all means, go for it. I&#039;m not really a proselytizer. 

But too much starch causes me to gain weight. Not a little starch now and then, but a steady diet of it. The vast majority of people I know who eat starchy diets are fat and out of shape, especially as they age. The vast majority of people I know who restrict their carbs are fit and healthy. I&#039;m not a scientist, so I can&#039;t explain exactly why that is so. Perhaps the scientists can&#039;t either. I just know what my eyes and ears tell me. 

And eating a low-carb/paleo diet is very EZ for me to do. And I really like the results. I usually don&#039;t spend a lot of time &quot;fixin&#039; what ain&#039;t broke.&quot;

I can&#039;t explain it any better than that.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I wonder if your low-carb diet hurts your sleep, meaning that a higher-carb diet would give you better sleep. With a good understanding of why low-carb diets produce weight loss, it might be possible to increase how much carbs you eat (to get better sleep) without causing weight gain. Without a theory, it is pure trial and error. A good theory about weight control should be able to greatly reduce the trial and error. When you say &quot;too much starch causes me to gain weight&quot; you may be drawing the wrong conclusion from your experience. Maybe one form of &quot;too much starch&quot; causes weight gain but another form would not.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe bananas work for some people because they are rich in potassium, which can be absent in the modern diet.   

Also, what about protein and fat at bedtime.  I have a favorite snack of riccotta cheese with honey.   The honey may help, but the protein from ricotta cheese may stabilize blood sugar and provide nutrients for muscle repair.   

Does fat like flaxseed oil help in the evening?  

I am wondering about people&#039;s experiences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But Seth, how many grams of CARBS per day were you eating? Yes, including the sugar in the water.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I increased my carb consumption, which caused me to lose weight. This contradicts the idea that carb reduction causes weight loss (which implies that carb increase should cause weight gain) no matter how many grams of carbs I was eating. When I was losing weight I wasn&#039;t eating very many carbs besides the sugar water because I had very little appetite.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
