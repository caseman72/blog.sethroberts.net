		<description><![CDATA[I teach English as a Second Language (ESL) to adults.  

One idea that crossed my mind is having students vote on enjoyment/engagement following an activity using their smartphones--there are sites that allow you to tally/analyze data from such votes.  

I do interest inventories with my students, as you suggested, and they are great.  Good suggestion.  We don&#039;t run experiments per se, as it&#039;s not a science class, but I&#039;m rather free to direct content toward student interest so this idea is still useful.  

Thanks for your thoughts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Anon Teacher: 

What do you teach? One of the thing were quantified self works well if it&#039;s about something you are interested in.

You might just ask your students. One the one hand we could do boring stuff in class. We could also do cool experiments. If any of you has a good proposal for an experiment we will do it.

Then have a genuine discussion with your students about their ideas and see whether you can lead them to something that makes a good experiment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 

Not relevant to the post, sorry:  

I&#039;m a teacher, and I&#039;m looking for any websites/books/resources regarding experiments that teachers have done independently in their classrooms to improve test scores, student satisfaction, etc.  I&#039;m looking for a sort of &quot;quantified classroom&quot; approach I guess.  I like to consider myself science-minded, but when I thought about implementing experiments in my classroom, I wasn&#039;t sure where to start.  If you have any thoughts or could make any suggestions through a post, comment, or e-mail, I&#039;d appreciate it.]]></description>
