		<description><![CDATA[A study can only be trusted if the participants are independent from each other. If you test Alice with SNP-detection chip X 100 times those 100 times aren&#039;t independent measurements. SNP-detection chip X might have a systematic bias. 

As far of the subject of what makes a good scale, I think these days a good scale should measure body fat.

If you do spend money on an expensive scale like the Withings scale you also get pulse measurements in addition to weight and body fat data. Having the air CO2 and temperature data can also be useful. 

____

Claiming that Wendy Chung changed the subject shows misunderstanding of how to read a newsarticle. Chung probably spend &gt;10 minutes at the telephone or in person with the journalist of the article and during that time she said that sentence or something that the journalist considers to be equivalent to that sentence. Given that the sentence is true, it doesn&#039;t suggest that Wendy Chung said anything wrong. 

I also don&#039;t see any indication that the journalist who wrote the article is naive. She did what a good journalist is supposed to do. She investigated whether the 3 companies are going to report similar results. She might have already expected the result of the measurements but I commend a journalist who actually goes out and tests and then tells the readers about the experiment. She doesn&#039;t just tell readers about what the FDA has to say but she actually goes out and experiments and reports the results to the readers.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: She is naive because she failed to address the question of measurement error. The subject of the article. It isn&#039;t clear she even understands what it is. I agree that it is a good article, just for the reason you said. Sometimes naive people do good work.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; They believe any study with less than 100 subjects cannot be trusted.

I&#039;d agree with them. See: publication bias, underpowering, winner&#039;s curse, base-rates, self-selection, internal vs external validity, assumption of normality and the central limit theorem. To name just a few reasons why small n studies, even if they have nice &lt;0.05 p-values, are predictably untrustworthy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ms. Peikoff (who I believe is the daughter of Leonard Peikoff, who was Ayn Rand’s choice for heir to her estate --– interesting if not relevant) ran into the same problem I did with the Quicksilver Scientific Co. &quot;mercury speciation&quot; test –-- New York does not allow these test kits to be mailed from New York to labs that are not certified according to some specific NYS standard.

		<description><![CDATA[Comments sections are just so perfect for tossing out frisbees of vocabulary. If one uses a highfalutin word, one surely must know what one is talking about. The Emperor has no clothes in all too many professions, not just medicine. But especially medicine. (But don&#039;t get me started about investment banking.)

Who tests the testers is a vital question. Re the tragedy of what happened in the state of Massachusetts with deliberately fudged lab tests that sent untold numbers of people to jail. Anyone who doesn&#039;t know about that, google and ye shall find.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, I linked to a story about the Massachusetts forensics tester who made up lab results. I wonder if better technical competence by the people who read her reports would have caught her fabrications much earlier.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
