[ Assuming this is all true, it seems that the liver would be fully depleted upon waking. Would McInnes suggest honey in the morning, as well? If not I would think the brain would be “in trouble”. ]

I thought the same thing and have been taking a shot of honey every 8 hours or so since I started doing this.  I missed an 8 hour window just the other day and I didn&#039;t notice any difference though.  I&#039;m still doing it every 8 hours as a snack, if anything else.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: There may be subtle improvement due to eating honey during the day. The improvement in sleep is not subtle.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would you believe there are more like 7 billion questions to answer?  Why? Because to get it 100% right it must be on an individual basis.  We all need to do our own experimenting and believe in the results we find for ourselves.

Leaving it to experts will always trend towards mass medication, mass profiteering and computerized averaging which will be good if the masses do it, but will produce poor results for many individuals.

		<description><![CDATA[Stuart King said,  (January 2nd, 9:42 pm)  it isn’t as much to do with the diet as it is to do with the good sleep!  Well summarized Stuart!  Diets are varied and contradictory, but sleep is universal!

And, Seth, balancing the diet is done simply by using the honey at night instead of in the morning which is our traditional (American?) way.     Even those souls who conscientiously use real honey from their own back yards, tend to see it as a breakfast food, especially in wintertime.   By switching it to a nighttime food, the balancing act is dramatically induced.

We use honey to start us, to stimulate us, to extend our activity levels, but decline to use it to balance us up with the rest and recuperation stage.

And to Eric,  If you want to improve on your Vitamin D production, put a thin (watery) lotion of honey on your skin ‘before’ you go out in the sun.  It feeds the cells that make the D, and even prevents burning to a great extent.

Depending on one’s age, learning to use this new-found energy from these insights, is critical.  Honey and all nostrums than give increased energy tend to prompt us to get out there and make up for lost time.  BIG MISTAKE!  

Do use some of that energy investing time in restful activity, or down time.  Restoring the body is a long time project.   Think of the honey as fuel in you motorcar.  Just doing double the miles is great, but what about the long term servicing, repairing and repainting?

Real honey enjoys about 1% of the sweeteners market.  It won’t take much of this kind of talk to double the demand, and still the potential is enormous (98% untapped).  Honey production is a dying industry.  Don’t get caught shot of real honey.

Many thanks to Mike McInnes for his brave venture into these truths.  To you also, Seth, for hosting intelligent discussion.    As a long term commercial honey producer I figure my industry may just survive.  Mankind himself may even survive!  Hooray!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I hope honey producers will realize that they themselves can gather data -- studying themselves -- on the value of honey for sleep. And they can publish it themselves on a website. There are a hundred questions to answer. For example, what is the best dose? What is the best time?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;We go to bed with a depleted liver. There is not enough fuel in the liver to supply the brain overnight. The way to resolve that is to forward-provision the brain, via the liver&quot;

&quot;Your liver has about 65-75 g of glucose in capacity. It releases 10 g every hour into the circulation – around 6-6 and a half grams to the brain. Do the math, you see the brain is in trouble at any tome is the 24 hour cycle if the liver reserve is low – especially in advance of the night fast.&quot;

Assuming this is all true, it seems that the liver would be fully depleted upon waking. Would McInnes suggest honey in the morning, as well? If not I would think the brain would be &quot;in trouble&quot;.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: One possibility is that brain function during the day is less important than brain function at night so that brain function during the day can get by with less blood sugar. Or maybe we should eat honey in the morning. A friend of mine who is a lawyer said that when he did the Atkins Diet he lost cases he would have won. It really did reduce how well his brain worked.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Honey at nighttime advice worked for me the first night.  I have continued it for the last 5 nights.  Even when I didn&#039;t get optimal amount of sleep - it still worked. 

When I say it worked, I mean I wake up refreshed, no grogginess, no headaches later after coffee - raring to go.  I can&#039;t remember the last time I&#039;ve felt this good waking up and throughout the day.  I still feel like napping around 3-4 PM everyday, but I can muscle through no problem now.  

In short, three words:  I feel great!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I lost weight when I drank sugar water. Can you explain that?

I saw that. The fructose would replenish the liver. &quot;

@Seth, it would have been interesting if you would have followed up with: I (and others) also lost weight by drinking extra light olive oil. How does your theory account for that?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t like to ask questions I know the answer to. I know the answer to that one: It doesn&#039;t.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been paleo/primal(sic) since September 2010. My main reason for trying paleo/primal was constant joint pain mostly in my knees and morning brain fog. These issues cleared up within weeks of starting the new diet. However from April 2011 I started a semi-constant 3am wakeup, with sweating and heart palpitations. This has got steadily worse and recently it&#039;s got so much worse that I have been waking up with a severe headache and very bad morning brain fog. 

Typically I eat my last meal no later than 7pm and then eat again only the following day at around noon. I&#039;ve never been big on eating in the morning or before 10am. Some days I have only one meal but most days two, rarely three. I&#039;ve never been overweight, weight now at 49 what I did at 20, and have no other current issues barring the sleep issue. 

As I am completely averse to ever stepping foot into a doctors office I started to trawl through the internet for answers. It&#039;s taken me weeks to get to this blog and the honey solution after wading through site after site talking about diabetes. Given I have no issues during the day and never really feel as though I have to eat even if only doing one feed a day, I ignored much of the discussion on diabetes. In any case I have an almost zero sugar diet with very low carbs - typically no more than 50g a day.

Having read through this interview I decided to give the honey solution a try as the nighttime liver glycogen issue resonated with me. So for the last two nights I have taken a tablespoon of honey just before bedtime and have woken up at 6am with no sleep interruption, no headache and very little brain fog. I&#039;ll be convinced this has legs if I can go for a month with no more 3am wakeups and morning fogginess.

Great blog Seth!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, that&#039;s very meaningful praise -- that this blog provides better (not just different) advice than other blogs. I think the failure of paleo gurus to advise a diet that produces great sleep is their single biggest failing. Obviously such a diet is paleo, that is, eaten by our ancestors, because I&#039;m sure our ancestors slept well. Please write again after a month, whatever the results. I hope you will buy McInnes&#039;s book, at least to thank him for the improvement.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This comment section has taken a detour from honey to calories, macronutrients, and bodyweight regulation.

Well since that happened I&#039;ll chime in and try to unite the two.  

Honey is fantastic for our gut microbes. Evidence is mounting that the microbiota orchestrates many facets of human health.  For example, see this 2012 review of honey and the microbiome: http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/17/1/248

Key quote: &quot;oligosaccharides present in honey might contribute to the antidiabetic and other health-related beneficial effects of honey.&quot;

<p>Well since that happened I&#8217;ll chime in and try to unite the two.  </p>
<p>Honey is fantastic for our gut microbes. Evidence is mounting that the microbiota orchestrates many facets of human health.  For example, see this 2012 review of honey and the microbiome: <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/17/1/248" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/17/1/248</a></p>
<p>Key quote: &#8220;oligosaccharides present in honey might contribute to the antidiabetic and other health-related beneficial effects of honey.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so silly that people debate macronutrients, totally sidestepping the gut microbiome like we&#8217;re sterile creatures.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, George!  The more people concentrate on being &quot;scientific&quot; about their eating habits, the more complicated they make their lives and the less they listen to their own bodies - which, let&#039;s face it, are far smarter in knowing what is best for each individual than the medical/scientific research establishment.  I would not be surprised if - when all is said and done - we learn that the best diet is the traditional diet from the area of the world from which our ancestors came.  In other words, the traditional Chinese diet is best for people of Chinese extraction, the traditional Italian diet is best for people whose families came from that part of the world, etc.  Such an approach toward diet takes into account both genetics and the natural environmental experiment in which people have evolved over thousands of years.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think experts are biassed to tell us stuff that is wrong because if they tell us to do what we are already doing, they seem less valuable. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this. Very useful. I plan to start taking it immediately. Can you please say how much honey? How many table spoons? And is there a difference between cooked and raw honey - which is better? Thanks once again.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: try 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of honey. I use cooked honey, haven&#039;t tried raw. Some people find differences, sometimes cooked is better, sometimes raw is better. Search the comments for details.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Daz - one of the things that allowed me to finally lose weight and keep it off for years is disregarding all the experts advice about how many calories I &quot;should&quot; be eating. I realized every time I hewed to the &quot;correct&quot; number of calorie I ended up being ravenous and crashed shortly after - sound familiar? It&#039;s pretty much every American&#039;s experience with trying to lose weight. Initial success following popular calorie recommendations followed by extreme hunger leading to crashing, leading to bizarre beliefs that it can&#039;t be about willpower but &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be about type of food consumed. Eventually I traveled overseas, forgot about calories, observed what the skinny locals were doing and practiced portion control like them. And I listened to my hunger and never let myself get too hungry, like the locals. And the pounds melted off and stayed off.

It seems clear to me now that paradoxically it&#039;s the too restrictive calorie recommendations in America that are actually responsible for the inability of Americans to successfully lose weight. Losing weight isn&#039;t a science, it&#039;s an art,  and the American approach, with its attempt to put everything into a mathematical formula and be precise, which doesn&#039;t pay attention to feelings of hunger, and which for some reason gets the calories very wrong, is disastrous and what&#039;s fueling our obesity epidemic. It&#039;s not that the scientific approach is wrong, it&#039;s just that we don&#039;t know enough yet about diet and nutrition to craft a reliable scientific approach, so in at this point our best bet is not to do &#039;pretend&#039; science but to do what skinny countries do; exercise portion control, listen to your hunger but don&#039;t pig out, and follow traditional guidelines about how much it&#039;s &#039;normal&#039; to eat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[by way of a bit of an example on the &#039;calorie counting&#039; subject, 
here is an interesting study that attempted to compare the predicted calories of Almonds &#039;on the label (so to speak)&#039; (predicted by the Atwater system http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwater_system )
and the &#039;actual/real&#039; calories (averaged across 18 subjects). 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396444/ 

&quot;Design: Eighteen healthy adults consumed a controlled diet or an almond-containing diet for 18 d. Three treatments were administered to subjects in a crossover design, and diets contained 1 of 3 almond doses: 0, 42, or 84 g/d. During the final 9 d of the treatment period, volunteers collected all urine and feces, and samples of diets, feces, and urine were analyzed for macronutrient and energy contents. The metabolizable energy content of the almonds was determined.

Results: The energy content of almonds in the human diet was found to be 4.6 ± 0.8 kcal/g, which is equivalent to 129 kcal/28-g serving. This is significantly less than the energy density of 6.0–6.1 kcal/g as determined by the Atwater factors, which is equivalent to an energy content of 168–170 kcal/serving. The Atwater factors, when applied to almonds, resulted in a 32% overestimation of their measured energy content.&quot;

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: very interesting, I&#039;ve always wondered about that -- the size of the undercount.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I believe that it is about hunger&quot;... I agree.

my &quot;it is about&quot; comment was more to do with pointing out that calorie counting is as a very inaccurate science, if you could actually count the calories that are absorbed in to the blood (which would be highly individual), that would mean something (as a metric), but of course that is impossible.

on the hunger topic, yes hunger will definitely be a big factor in the qty (&amp; type?) of food you stuff in your face]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It’s not the calories. Calories are nonsensical in the context of a human diet&quot;

yes &amp; no. it is about energy. if you absorb more energy into the blood stream then you burn over a period of time, then weight will increase, that can be both fat &amp; lean body mass. 
the problem with counting calories is that it does not reflect the actual energy that is passed in to the blood stream, which is an individual thing. way too many variables to try &amp; work out how much real energy you will get from a particular &#039;calorie of any food&#039; at one time...some things that will influence this are, gut flora, thyroid &amp; anabolic hormones/metabolism, food type,...etc, etc

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I believe that it is about hunger, not energy or calories. Hunger determines how much you will eat.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

this would seem to gel with the data on omega-6 consumption (&amp; production) in the US in recent history.
