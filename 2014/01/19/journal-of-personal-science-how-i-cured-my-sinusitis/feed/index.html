		<description><![CDATA[I had terrible sinus problems in high school -- sinusitis, polyps.  Eventually, my sense of smell was gone.  Multiple visits to my ENT got me nowhere.  Finally, in my late 20s, I started rinsing with a very strong saline solution (using an enema bag).  Worked like a charm!  My sense of smell, which had been mostly non-existent for 10 years, returned and has been with me now for over 20 years.  No maintenance rinsing has been needed.  The nice things about using the enema bag were that 1) the force was very easily controlled by my grip on the tube, and 2) those bags hold much more water than any neti pot or squeeze bottle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t heard of the Baby shampoo treatment. I had really bad sinus trouble and heard from Jerry Pournelle that a SinuPulse would help. I bought one and used it with salt water for a couple of years almost every day. It helped but what worked best and finally stopped my sinus was using sea salt, a pinch of baking soda,  a couple drops of Lugal&#039;s solution and a 1/2 teaspoon of H2O2 in the sinupulse for wash. Now I still use it but infrequently as my sinus problems are not near as bad. The sinupulse is expensive but worth it if you have sinus as bad as I had. There&#039;s two different kinds. One has a round tank. My round one stopped working in about a year. The other has a square tank and I still have it. It&#039;s lasted longer. Of course the square tank cost more. I think the square one is called a SinuPulse Elite. I have no financial interest in SinuPulse . Just have used their products. I also would not use the dial valve that lowers the flow. I believe that it puts more pressure on the pump. If the flow is too much don&#039;t press so hard against the nostril and let a little of the flow escape.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was younger and even into my 30;s I had sinus trouble and ear infections frequently. In the last decade or so I take N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) 500mg morning and noon and xylitol (4 grams or so morning and evening). You can buy xylitol in bulk (e.g. 1-2kg bag) and get enough for 4-6 months. Theories, NAC thins mucous keeps flowing, xylitol breaks down bio-film and has a specific anti-bacterial effect (confused with sugar but not digestible by them). 

Two more things to consider stirring into the mix.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You should check out http://drellie.com .  She says cavities are caused by the wrong bacteria in your mouth making acid or acidic foods, and suggests using 3 different common mouthwashes, the original crest, and xylitol to reduce it, and it seems to work for me.  I even have a xylitol nasal spray, but I haven&#039;t tried it.  I had gotten a lot of cavities lately and I&#039;m in my upper 40s.  I also have this weird inflamed feeling in the base of my nostrils when I&#039;m hungry.  And I have some stomach gastritis, but my dr said &#039;everybody has that&#039;.  But I think my better mouth state helps everything else.]]></description>

This is a good point.  I use J&amp;J baby shampoo, because it was (briefly) recommended by the UCSD researcher.

...yet they changed the formula this month to eliminate quaternium.

		<description><![CDATA[I have suffered sinus congestion for 30 years, trying everything from inhalers- effective for 12 hours-then no nose breathing whatsoever- and addictive; Pseudoephedrine- ineffective- and raised BP; steroids- ineffective; nasal antihistamine spray and pills- ineffective; months long series of allergy injections- so far no result; double dose of amoxicelian for the tooth-no change.
A recent continuing sinus infection was surely caused by a right maxillary first molar infection which had an, apparently unsuccessful, root canal in 2011. I had it removed a week ago (leaving a hole the &quot;size of a nickel&quot; into my sinus cavity which had to be stitched up) but my right nostril is still partially blocked. I have been using a neti pot which helps for a while. I am considering breathing steaming water with a few drops of tea tree oil because of its antibiotic, and hopefully anti-fungal properties after seeing a &#039;Dr. Oz&#039; program touting oregano oil for the same reasons.
I would hesitate to sinus rinse with any commercial shampoo because of the many GRAS chemicals which I DO NOT RECOGNIZE AS SAFE and do not use. Remember that chemicals are easily absorbed through the skin and mucus membranes.
My weak Delta Dental plan does not cover tooth implants, very little toward the cost of the Periodontists&#039; tooth extraction fee, and of course nothing toward &#039;silver amalgam&#039; (Wikipedia: &quot;It commonly consists of mercury (50%), silver (~22-32% ), tin (~14%)&quot; tooth filling removal.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I have Delta Dental and it covered about half the cost of my &quot;silver amalgam&quot; removal. Contact Sandor Hites, my dentist in Berkeley, to find out how this is done. 

About your sinus congestion: Have you considered the possibility that it is due to an allergy?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife and I usually have major sinus issues from Nov to March each year.  This involves sinus rinses multiple times per week, Vaporub at night + a humidifier and taking the occasional decongestant.  This fall a ran into a blog (can&#039;t remember where) that recommended drinking a Tbsp of unpasteurized apple cider vinegar before bed.  We only do this every other day or so and we dilute it with half a glass of water (I can&#039;t image drinking it straight).  The results have been shockingly awesome.  I haven&#039;t done a single rinse, the humidifier is still stashed away in a closer somewhere and I haven&#039;t purchased any decons.  We&#039;ve experimented with skipping a 3-4 days and we both start to get a little clogged up.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s interesting, especially since Japanese and Koreans drink vinegar drinks -- for example, pomegranate vinegar. I like them and drink them too. There is about 1 tablespoon of vinegar in each drink.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I usually have major sinus issues from Nov to March each year.  This involves sinus rinses multiple times per week, Vaporub at night + a humidifier and taking the occasional decongestant.  This fall a ran into a blog (can&#8217;t remember where) that recommended drinking a Tbsp of unpasteurized apple cider vinegar before bed.  We only do this every other day or so and we dilute it with half a glass of water (I can&#8217;t image drinking it straight).  The results have been shockingly awesome.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s no surprise that your dentist would not confirm your correlation -- I would not be surprised if they are taught in dental school to deny, deny, deny!  The differing metals in the typical amalgam filling constitute a battery, with saliva as electrolyte.  So you might be able to get a lasting solution with the right dental work -- I recommend Dr. Hal Huggins&#039;-trained dentists (he has a website and contact number). My dental revision is making a huge difference for me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article. I think the literature does use J&amp;J Baby Shampoo. Recently, the company is replacing the old formula with one that doesn&#039;t have formaldehyde (supposed to hit the stores in the near future). Any recommendations for other baby shampoos for the sinus rinse that are equally effective without formaldehyde? Also, given that biofilms are the problem in sinusitis, and the surfactants in the detergents are the solution to breaking down the solution, what are the active ingredients that we should be looking for when selecting a proper baby shampoo for this rinse?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some years back I suffered from eczema on my eyelids that persisted and persisted.  I knew if I saw a dermatologist I would be given a steroid and did not want something that serious near my eyes - so stayed far away from the medical profession, except the medical literature.  One source - a Mayo Clinic document - suggested using baby shampoo full strength on the eyelids twice a day.  It worked amazingly well - after about 18 months of disfiguring and painful eyelids the baby shampoo cleared it up in less than a week.  Hasn&#039;t returned since (knocking on wood).]]></description>
