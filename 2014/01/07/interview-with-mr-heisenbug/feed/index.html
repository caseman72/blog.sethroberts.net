		<description><![CDATA[One of the best, if not THE best source of resistant starch (RS) is potato starch. It&#039;s almost pure RS, with no additional carb effects. Bob&#039;s Red Mill Potato Starch is the one most people are now using to get more fermentable fiber. Most natural food sections have it, or you can get it on Amazon.

Note: it&#039;s NOT simply potato flour. It&#039;s potato STARCH. Potato flour is just dried and powdered potatoes. It contains almost zero RS.

A few hundred people have been experimenting with it, to almost universal positive effect. Check out the Free the Animal blog to get some more info. There are dozens of posts and hundreds of comments.

		<description><![CDATA[Daz,

The only reason to actively avoid any specific type of fiber, as far as I know, is if you have a specific intolerance for it and it gives you gastrointestinal problems. Even insoluble fiber isn&#039;t necessarily &quot;bad.&quot; But it can come in a package, like wheat, that may give you separate issues.

The only reason you&#039;d put FOS or Inulin in the &quot;avoid&quot; bucket is because they are both fructans and belong to the &quot;FODMAP&quot; group -- types of carbohydrates that some people do not absorb properly and thus experience gastrointestinal issues. The &quot;FODMAP Diet&quot; is specifically designed for those people. In this case, I think GOS would probably have to be on that list too.

The question in my mind about this is that, since that kind of intolerance may be caused by small intestine bacterial overgrowth (ie, fermentation happening where it shouldn&#039;t), then presumably any type of fermentable fiber would be an issue, not just FODMAPs. Also, I&#039;m curious as to whether FODMAP intolerant people have a problem with FOS, since it&#039;s shorter chain and known to cause less issues than something like inulin.

For now, only your personal experimentation can answer these questions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi Mr. H,

i was just looking at an old list i quickly put together quite a while back,
in the doc i listed fibres that i did not want to go looking for ie. may be best for me to avoid.
&amp; fibres that probably worth getting ie. may be good for me.
i should clarify that at the time i probably put things on the &#039;avoid list&#039; if i read some &#039;bad press&#039; about it...eg. low fodmap diets?

anyway at the time, my list went like this,
&#039;avoid/bad&#039;: Insoluble (roughage), FOS, fructan, Inulin, 
&#039;good&#039;: RS (resistant starch), Pectin, GOS?, 

the list is likely way over-simplified, if it makes any sense at all...?

anyway just wondered if you may have some sort of list of your own, possibly ordering &#039;good&#039; to &#039;bad&#039; dietary fibre.
&amp;/or comment on my list.

i seem to recall at the time that pectin look interesting, &amp; i was already on the RS &#039;bandwagon&#039;. not sure why i thought GOS may be a good one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heisenbug, I wondered why UHT milk in Tetrapacks tastes different, sweeter, than regular milk.  Also it is a bit of a quandary: some moderately lactose intolerant people report that they can consume SOME UHT milk without catastrophe.  I suppose eventually the laxative action of the lactulose will get them if the lactose doesn&#039;t again depending on volume ingested.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adam,

Lactulose is definitely shown to be potently prebiotic/bifidogenic. In fact, it&#039;s what they use in those breath tests I mentioned in the comment above.

My only issue with it is that it&#039;s not really something found in food. It&#039;s commercially produced from lactose as a food ingredient and for medical purposes. As the article says, you can find lactulose in milk, but only because of the pasteurization process. As such, I don&#039;t see a reason to go out of one&#039;s way to obtain lactulose (it isn&#039;t very practically obtained) when there are other good options that have more of a basis in human dietary patterns.

Daz: I was just thinking that myself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post/interview. 

A few things. I know that people who have heart problems are required to take antibiotics before having dental work...I assume that there are some studies out there showing the connection between these two problems. Might make for some good reading/future posts on Heisenbug. This might also help confirm your theory about heart disease, bacteria, and smoking. 

Also to Kirk, because I have a toddler at home, I have learned more than I wanted to know about sleep cycles. The three hour mark is the end of a typical sleep cycle. I am wondering if something at 3 hours is waking you up because that is when you are most wake-able...Conversely, I am wondering if the honey somehow extends the sleep cycle to 5 hours making everyone more rested.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stuart,

The smoking study did not just pick random people off the street who had already quit smoking. It was a controlled cessation study.

Your second point is a good one. I too wonder if certain dietary or other factors are protective from smoking&#039;s microbial impact. After all, tobacco smoking is ancient and has existed for a long time. But the very high levels of the diseases it is strongly associated with are not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kirk,

Foods high in fermentable prebiotic fiber are pretty easy to find provided you know what to look for. Fructooligosaccharides/inulin/resistant starch/mucilage/pectin is a good list and should direct you to plenty of foods.

Honey contains many oligosaccharides that have all been shown to have prebotic activity. The FOS in honey (kestose, nystose, inulobiose) are among those. The oligosaccharides are formed from honey&#039;s simple sugars by the activity of enzymes provided by bees.

The amount of fermentable fiber in a teaspoon of honey would be well below 1 gram. If honey has outsized prebiotic activity, it is likely due its unique combination of oligosaccharides. Trying to isolate/duplicate this somehow in an experiment would be quite difficult outside of a lab setting. But I still think it would be worthwhile to test for a prebiotic effect, and a pure formulation of FOS would probably be the closest substrate (something like: http://www.amazon.com/NOW-Foods-Nutra-Flora-Ounce/dp/B0002JIXLM/).

I guess coincidentally, the 3 hour mark is probably a good general marker for when you&#039;d expect fermentation to begin. That&#039;s when the small intestine would be mostly emptied, and this is also confirmed by breath tests which test for malabsorption and small intestine bacterial overgrowth. The cutoff for these tests is 2.5 to 3 hours -- anything detected before then is considered premature fermentation. After 3 hours is considered to be normal colonic fermentation. Among fibers, oligosaccharides/FOS are known to ferment very rapidly and preferentially.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mr Heisenbug have you considered that the differences in bacterial groups in smokers are due to other causes rather than cigarettes? Smokers may not be as health conscious and may be less likely to eat vegetables for example. Perhaps the positive changes in microbial composition after smoking cessation may be due to other lifestyle changes (improved diet). Quite often smoking cessation is accompanied by an overall effort to improve health in other ways also. 

I would be interested in seeing the microbial composition of someone who ate more like Michael Pollan but smoked regularly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth and Heisenbug (love your name!)

The famed NEJM beta carotene was a failure in not just that trial but ALL synthetic Lurotin beta-carotene trials like HATS, Physicians health, and CARET.  It is factory made from benzene petroleum derivatives by the chemical company BASF AG. These are not bio-identical to mammalian receptors.  The fact that synthetic non-bioidentical hormones like PROVERA in the Women&#039;s Health Initiative where record numbers of women died of strokes, cancer and heart risks are inherently dangerous cannot be overstated, I think.

Great post and interview!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. That&#039;s a good point. Which I never heard Bruce Ames make.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Seth and Heisenbug (love your name!)</p>
<p>The famed NEJM beta carotene was a failure in not just that trial but ALL synthetic Lurotin beta-carotene trials like HATS, Physicians health, and CARET.  It is factory made from benzene petroleum derivatives by the chemical company BASF AG. These are not bio-identical to mammalian receptors.  The fact that synthetic non-bioidentical hormones like PROVERA in the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative where record numbers of women died of strokes, cancer and heart risks are inherently dangerous cannot be overstated, I think.</p>
<p>Natural, food-based carotenoids are not only safe but extremely efficacious.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[This is a great interview, Seth, thanks.

@MrHeisenbug, thank you.  I hope you have time to answer several questions. 

1)  You say that honey is rich in scFOS.  How does one determine which foods contain decent prebiotic capabilities?  

2) I find that a rounded teaspoon of honey, taken just before bedtime, significantly improves my sleep.  Does that contain enough scFOS to alter the microbiome?

3) What is the transit time, from ingestion to when scFOS starts to be fermented?  I know that my sleep is improved by the 3-hour mark, because that&#039;s when I historically have woken up from my initial sleep.  On the honey protocol I sleep deeply until the 5-hour mark.  So whatever it is in honey which makes me sleep better, it is being used by the body/mind within 3 hours.

4) Others suggest it is the sugars in the honey which cause the improved sleep.  Or perhaps some of the other 200+ factors in honey.  Can you suggest designs for experiments which would tease out the true causes of improved sleep?  For example, ingesting a certain type of sugar, or ingesting an isolated fermentable fiber.

5) How long do prebiotics stay in the gut?  Are they consumed within a 24-hour cycle or do they stay around longer?  So could somebody eat a food with scFOS one day and it would not only improve sleep that night but the next night as well?

In conclusion, many thanks for bringing your knowledge and enthusiasm to this fascinating subject.]]></description>
