		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I think it’s easier for governments to focus on ‘the drug’ rather than ‘the addictive society’.&quot;

I agree. Easier for governments and professors who need to publish regularly. Just as it is easier to focus on &quot;which is the best treatment for Disease X?&quot; rather than &quot;What causes Disease X?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[RE: Morning faces…one of my favorite jobs over the years was being a breakfast cook. I got to see a lot of morning faces. And looking back, it seems to me that the regulars, who would come in every morning (a common breakfast joint phenomena) were basically pretty happy. Hardly any regular “grumps.” And I still love going out for breakfast, it’s my favorite meal to go out for. And I don’t think it’s just the coffee that makes people feel good, based on Seth’s hypothesis.

As to addiction, there is a major neurochemical component to it, and it can be turned on and off with various amino acids (for a lot of people, not everyone). That can be related to the happiness buffer, too, of course. If your neurochemistry is screwed up, by environment or genetics, and you’re always fighting that, it doesn’t take much to push you over the edge. Fix that, and it’s a lot easier to deal with other habitual behavior. And yes, I worked with a chemical dependency program to do just that, and it helped a lot of folks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt Stone talks about similar ideas in a few differnt articles. One, about Rat Park, and another about 1811 Eastlake, in Seattle. 1811 is a very successful so -called &quot;wet house&quot; for the homeless that allows its residents to have alcohol. The success is measured in taxpayer money saved and also by how much drinking has declined. It seems to point to the idea that seeing a human, or even a rat, as who they are, and allowing them to be seen and take care of their most basic needs which includes socialization and acceptance, can make all the difference in addiction healing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[According to the gospel of John (me!) addiction has two components, one physical the other spiritual, mental or psychological (you choose one from those three or add the correct one).

No one can administer any help, pill, advice, or whatever, that will work for any individual until that individual is ready to accept the challenge and make  changes.   Depending on the addiction, it will take more than just a little effort.

AA did well as long as it was alcohol and cigarettes it targeted.  When Overeaters Anonymous came along (same problem, addiction to food) the ‘cold turkey’ the ‘never another mouthful of food’ type of logic, simply wasn’t enough.  The overeaters had to learn a better way, as quitting eating proved to be fatal.

They found that following the 12 steps was all it took, just that they had to dig deeper into the psyche to work out why they were so unhappy, fix that, then curing the addiction was easy going.  In the 12 steps programs, reference to god is somewhat ambiguous as it speaks to “god as you understand him or perceive him (something to that effect).”   Which is erroneous, of course, as it assumes god is a male, humanoid, personalized etc., but worst of all ‘perceivable.’  It denies the fact that we are god unto ourselves.

Replace god with yielding to the other side of your head as in ‘right brain’ would work for me. The opposite is true also, yielding to the ‘left brain.’  Addiction cannot be cured without the assistance of both hemispheres.   Males in particular are loathe to go into right brain stuff, females equally, do not care to live by logic (as a generalization).  But it is all in our head, both the problem and the solution.

If you read the Book, Feed Your Brain First, by Dr. Fessenden (Co-Author with McInnes in The Honey Revolution) you will discover the energy used by the brain is not always full speed ahead.  As the health deteriorates or the day wears on, energy level get low, the voltage to the brain falls and the survival lobes get the first pick with the cerebrum (higher brain) taking what is left over. Chronic Depression always includes the condition of chronic partial brain starvation.

So to cure any addiction especially those leading to depression, get the body energized (using natural foods and herbal medicines) so the brain is fully powered.   Then one can think straight about using the decision making process intelligently.   However, until that individual is ready to make the big change, nothing will work on a permanent basis.   Making the big change will always work, even if the body lags behind.  Fixing the body only will only partially work…………. With the problem reoccurring further down the track.

Another good book (which I haven&#039;t read) is called &quot;The Pleasure Trap.&quot;  I think there are several of a similar title, so can&#039;t speak for them all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A story about addiction:

I quit smoking 41 years ago. I was a 4-pack (Lucky Strikes) a day smoker. Before I turned off the alarm clock in the morning, I would light a cigarette. I HAD to have a cigarette. Yeah, it was that bad. I only needed a few matches to get through an entire day - and 4 packs of Lucky Strikes.

I tried to quit dozens of times. I would try cutting back, try filters, even menthols (yuck!). I might make it two weeks, then back to puffing like a locomotive. Nothing worked. I LIKED smoking. I NEEDED to smoke.

Then a lucky thing happened to me while confined to a hospital bed with double pneumonia. My second bout of pneumonia in just 6 months. I almost died. Some do-gooder doctor wheeled in a movie projector and showed me a film about what smoking can do to you (okay, I already knew it could kill me, but that apparently wasn&#039;t enough). The film was of an autopsy of a person who died from lung cancer. And the mere sight of the cancerous lung, and the horrible damage the smoking had done (imagine the sight of someone peeling hot asphalt off a roadway), and I was done with smoking. Forever. Haven&#039;t had a cigarette since. Not one. Do I still get urges to smoke? Yes. Especially when having a drink. But I will never smoke another cigarette. Period.

Haven&#039;t had pneumonia since, and rarely even get a cold.

The dumbest thing I&#039;ve done in my life was to start smoking.  The smartest thing I&#039;ve ever done was to stop.

Thank God for do-gooder doctors!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Re AA. My research suggests that AA meetings (a) should be held only in the morning (b) quite early, like 7 am. Maybe the seating arrangements should be changed, too, so that people are closer together. Or the meeting should be preceded by 30 minutes of simple socializing.&quot;

My grandfather spontaneously quit drinking after years of having to be frequently hospitalized to &quot;dry out&quot; and severe liver cirrhosis.  He had a job where the older guys would show up an hour or so early to work and sit at benches outside, drink coffee, chew tobacco and socialize.  Now I&#039;m wondering if his habit of going to work early came first.  It&#039;s interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, have you heard of the &#039;rat park&#039; experiments?  I think you must have.  

Addicted rats were put into a happy rat environment (about 200x the size of a regular rat cage with both space and privacy tunnels), and allowed to do things rats like to do (have sex, socialise, eat, sleep, play with toys).  Most detoxed themselves, even when their substance of abuse was freely available.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, I haven&#039;t heard of them. Thanks.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex: For every orange paper there is a green one. :)

http://www.green-papers.org/

This is just a guess, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if AA&#039;s success rate was as good as psychotherapy&#039;s alone. Done together, they appear to be the best thing we currently have to offer.

Gina: &quot;Saying that 12 step treatment is the best we can do is a pretty grim view.&quot;

I didn&#039;t say that, of course. I&#039;ll refer back to my posts on various diets and say again that there are many ways to skin a cat. And lots of cats have lost their skins to AA.  We should be thankful for that, while we look for even better ways to help people in distress and pain.

Seth: That sounds like an idea worth testing! The trick, as I see it, would be to get them up that early.  :)]]></description>
