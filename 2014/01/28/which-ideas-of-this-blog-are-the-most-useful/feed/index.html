		<description><![CDATA[Sleep and allergies have been your most useful subjects for me.

A subject you haven&#039;t covered, but which might be popular, is female hair loss.  It seems possibly more treatable than male pattern baldness -- there are hints of nutritional or hormonal causes (lysine, iron, thyroid, estrogen, etc.) -- but it does not seem to have the full attention of the normal medical community.

I wonder if you have any self-experimenting readers out there who have succeeded with this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For me, I&#039;d say the &quot;most useful&quot; was just seeing another academic say some of the things I&#039;ve been thinking about (but seemed crazy). For example, &quot;appreciative&quot; vs &quot;critical&quot; thinking. Stuff like that.

On self-experimentation front, eating food with no taste (noseclip) is so effective it&#039;s like cheating.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am so  very gratefull for this blog. I have learned D vitamin in the morning, for me it is a life saver. I live in the nordic countries and have problem in the winter. I also find it helps me sleep better. Sunglasses in the evening when looking on TV or computer, makes it much easier to go to sleep. Earlier I had to stop at 8pm to be able to sleep in normal time.
Omega tree helps my gums and I do not need to go to the dentist so often. I used to have severe gum problems with a lot of inflammation and bleeding, as i lost my own teeth in a car-crache back in the 70. As I think gluten is not that good for me anymore, so I make crackers out of flaxseed to have for breakfast instead. 
I also use a lot of butter today and I feel it is good.  I am raised in the fat fobic generation, I did not eat any butter or fat for more than 30 years.
When I work a lot from  home I do faces in the morning, but when I work I meet a lot of people early in the morning
I of course tried the bedtime honey sine a couple of week, I cannot for sure say if it is very good or only good. Some nights I wake up at 02.00 am on honey, I mix with a green banana before bedtime. On the banana I do not wake up at 2 am.  But I am more alert the day after on honey before bedtime.

Perhaps those that get insomnia on honey react different. Like some people like my self cannot drink coffee  later than 3 pm and other can drink coffee just before bedtime.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have tried taking honey before bedtime(I tried 1,2,3 and 6 teaspoons on different occassions) and in every case I could not get to sleep for hours! It kept me awake for hours and acted like a strong stimulant! I felt terrible and mean in the morning every time; not well rested. So like most things, Honey before bedtime may help some people sleep better but may not work for everyone.

In Chinese Medicine, honey (and/or sugar, liquorice or anything that tastes sweet) is used to cure ailments of the stomach and small intestine. It is a YIN energy tonic, taken for enrgy. It is also good for the lungs and large intestine but bad for the kidneys, bones, teeth,sex organs and hair on the head. Sweets are also used to water down the effects of stronger herbs and medications. Two tablespoons of sugar in 12 ounces of water will usually cure nausea or stomach aches quickly. Also Seth, I&#039;ve been wanting to tell you how foolish it is that modern medicine uses sugar pills as placebos for medical studies, because sugar itself is a medicine and cures many ailments it cannot be considered a placebo. And as you have proven, it can also be used as an appetite suppression. And Seth,it&#039;s amazing but oil and butter fall into the same Chinese medicinal category as honey and sugar... so strenthening the stomach and small intestine may be yet another benefit of the Shangri-La diet!

And as to Honey, the great mathematician Pythagoras is known to have eaten only bread and honey all of his life, and he lived to be well over 100 years old.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like the idea of do it ourselves science, especially if you can pull a bunch of like minded people together, Seth.   Not that there is a great dearth of good science, but mostly the good stuff is too controversial so it gets swept under the carpet if favor of something more &#039;politically correct.&#039;

Even on a full tummy, sugars can find space, hence we can always roll up for pudding regardless of having gagged previously on turkey.  Just as water will find room in a jar full of marbles, sugars can squeeze into a glass full of water without changing the volume.

Seth, what do the Chinese think of honey?   Is real honey vs analog honey an issue there?  I hear they are keen importers of Australian honey yet are regarded statistically as the world&#039;s greatest exporter of &#039;honey.&#039;

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The Chinese think honey is a health food. Many vendors sell only honey. However, I don&#039;t hear about it being associated only with bedtime. I can buy Australian honey at stores that sell foreign products but not most stores. Most Chinese food stores sell only honey from China.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Item [b] (bedtime honey) helped me with item [a] (morning faces).

Since I have been on hemo-dialysis, it&#039;s been very difficult to get out of bed around 5:30 am PST in order to get a strong effect from the faces.  With the honey, I have plenty oomph even on only 5-6 hours sleep. (After the treatment, I can take a nap to catch up.)

Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two results I have had from two ideas on this blog :

1) Flaxseed oil, which has mostly fixed my problems with bleeding and painful gums. 

2) Probiotics. Unexpectedly, a long standing, nagging pain in my right hip has almost gone since I started taking a daily probiotic supplement to improve my gut microflora. 

Taking the probiotic, and adding more prebiotics like leeks to my diet, are the only major changes I can think of that happened at the same time. It may just be coincidence - however a Google search for people with conditions like Crohns and IBS and with hip pain brings up quite a few results, so who knows there may be a connection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Al, you know that tens of millions of Americans eat cookies or ice cream before bed each night, right?


Visit your local market around 10 pm any night and see what&#039;s being scanned at the registers.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, I did not know that. That&#039;s a very interesting idea, that there is a shift in what is bought toward sweet stuff in the evening. Where I live in Beijing there is a massive shift in what is sold in the evening: fruit is much more available after 6 pm than before because a bunch of fruit vendors open for business. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
