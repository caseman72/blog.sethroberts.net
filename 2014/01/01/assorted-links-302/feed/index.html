		<description><![CDATA[That patients are not told the risks is true.  I do not disagree that the simple tonsillectomy is overdone, but one heck of a lot of people survive it, as did my dad who died not of complications from the operation as a kid, but simply from being old at 93.

Huffington post is not necessarily wrong, but also does not possess papal level infallability.

http://overlawyered.com/2013/12/jahi-mcmaths-routine-tonsillectomy/

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the source. Yeah, almost everyone survives it, I suppose no one notices that their immune system is not working so well because the tonsillectomy is given to people whose immune function is already bad (e.g., due to poor sleep). I was really surprised when I started sleeping better and stopped getting sick in the usual ways, nobody had ever said that was possible. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My niece just had her tonsils removed. I sent a link from what you (Seth) posted some time ago. But my sister went ahead with the surgery partly because her daughter kept getting infections and started having trouble breathing. Now my sister is thinking of having all her children&#039;s tonsils removed after the &quot;successful&quot; removal of her daughter&#039;s tonsils.

My sister&#039;s family have a very poor diet (although it has gotten a little better) in my opinion. Lot&#039;s of processed foods and sugary foods. They have stopped eating quite so much processed foods and have stopped eating cereal but the poor health continues. I guess they still haven&#039;t removed enough bad foods.

My stepfather recently died after he had another heart attack (4th or 5th?) at the age of 65. He was diagnosed with diabetes sometime ago (15 or 20 years ago). But couldn&#039;t muster up the will power to sustain a healthy diet. Apparently a nurse told him 2 weeks before he died that if he didn&#039;t change his diet he would be dead within 5 years guaranteed. After having multiple heart/artiary surgeries he started have trouble breathing from the last one. He couldn&#039;t even get to the mailbox without breathing heavy. He wanted to live longer but couldn&#039;t muster the willpower I guess. It is pretty sad. He basically poisoned himself over his whole life and probably cut 20 years off his life if not more.

I think these examples from my family definitely make me want to stick to a healthy and clean lifestyle. I find it interesting when people say, &quot;I want to live a good life, I want my sugar!&quot; It seems like a very selfish thing to say as if other people around them don&#039;t care about their life. It is not just their life that they are ruining, it is also affecting those around them. After my stepfather got diabetes he was much more moody and harder to get along with, that&#039;s 20 years of being around someone with mood swings that could have been avoided.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was not a routine tonsilectomy, but a Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.  Is there an ambulance being chased.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: This article says it was a tonsillectomy:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/21/jahi-mcmath-life-support_n_4485119.html

Massive bleeding is a common side effect of tonsillectomy. Are you saying that this particular version of a tonsillectomy is much risker than other versions? If so where does that information come from? 

My general point about tonsillectomies is that patients are not told the true risk. You disagree?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
