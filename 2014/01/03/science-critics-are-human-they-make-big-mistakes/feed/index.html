		<description><![CDATA[Seth, here is my take on &#039;science.&#039;

It is a new word brought about by the need to quit using the word &#039;truth.&#039;
The priests of our religions just about murdered the word truth, to the point where it was no longer viable.    So the &#039;scientific method&#039; was designed to differentiate between &#039;truths&#039; as the establishments (religions?) issued them, and workable facts that were in keeping with current understanding.

But what we really did at that point was establish a new religion.  We created a body of thought more up to date, yes, and far more practical, workable and predictable.  It followed that it also made more and better results, which are expressed as money.

Yet we only changed what we believed to be true.   Never did the scientific method guarantee that the conclusions drawn from the data would be correct or long lasting.  New science contradicts old science every day.  The science of today will be obsolete tomorrow, so to speak, at least in many instances.

Once we as individuals &#039;believe&#039; something to be true, it becomes truth to us.  Unfortunately we are usually loathe to back away from that position, and when the masses believe untruths, the &#039;church&#039; becomes the haunt of dogma.

Individualized science is the only good solution.  If I believe it, it is true for me.  I can learn better tomorrow, maybe, but for today it is true.  Others may find my truth nothing more than lies.  Bully for them........... as I see their truth as lies all too often.   But it is only truth if the individual believes it really and truly…………. like deep down, man.  And if I am not prepared to act on that belief, probably I don&#039;t really believe it.  

Unfortunately the &#039;science&#039; of today has morphed into a religion, duly presided over by High Priests who maintain yesterday&#039;s truth for the protection of the power and influence of established methods and organizations.

The www is doing to &#039;science&#039; and the power bases it has spawned what Christianity did to the Roman Empire and the printing press did to the Catholic Church (which the Roman Empire morphed into).

Individualism has taken a back seat to collectivism in the last hundred years, but the www has ushered in a whole new epoch.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree. The habits of mind, the built-in tendencies, that led to religion didn&#039;t change just because science was invented. I think of personal science as similar to literacy, and mass literacy rested on the printing press.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nancy Lebovitz,

I drink a lot, and have used this combination for years.  It works!  It is a bit of a pain, because you need to pop an NAC, C and B1 with almost every drink, but it&#039;s worth it.  I bring my pill bottles to the bar and hand them out to friends.

Another thing that I think all drinkers should have on hand is Evening Primrose Oil.  It prevents liver damage and tolerance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Off-topic: I just ran across this, and it seems like the kind of thing you and/or your readers might want to look into. I drink very little, so I&#039;m won&#039;t be helping with the research.

&quot;A large social group that I am involved in, which has been known to drink heavily, has started taking N-acetyl-cysteine (500-1000mg) and Source Naturals Hangover Formula (which is primarily a C &amp; B complex), and the effect it has on hangovers is not in any way subtle.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right, so he commits a very basic and fundamental purely logical error that anyone with a good training in philosophy or science or who has taken the trouble to consciously develop good intellectual habits would easily avoid. 

What strikes me is 

1) How relatively basic the error is yet serves as the basis for his entire position.

2) How utterly characteristic this kind of thing is across the nutrition field even with researchers and writers on nutrition. 

The entire field needs to be massively cleaned up and high intellectual standards imposed. Will this happen? The problem here seems to be that nutrition and diet have some kind of connection with our need for myth and the search for human meaning in a way that a more abstract science like physics simply doesn&#039;t have. The result is that nutrition and diet frequently stimulate the emotions and the myth-making faculty in ways that physics does not. This emotion doesn&#039;t just distort thinking but seems]]></description>
