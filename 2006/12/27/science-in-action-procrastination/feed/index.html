		<description><![CDATA[I just saw this on http://www.gradschoolstory.com/archives/95/how-to-get-started-on-anything and had to add it -- it will appeal to self-experimenters:

From the blog post:
I usually work on multiple projects at the same time, and whenever a new project comes along, I find it really difficult to actually get started. Once Iâ€™ve begun making progress, Iâ€™m able to move smoothly without any problems. Itâ€™s the getting started thatâ€™s really difficult, especially if itâ€™s something Iâ€™m not really interested in. At an intellectual level I know I have to get started, but Iâ€™m not able to summon up the motivation to begin.

For the last few months, the most reliable technique Iâ€™ve found to help me get started is to take the work to a coffee shop and begin while sipping coffee. Iâ€™ve found that this allows me to get excited about whatever is in front of me at that time. My brain appears to misattribute the physiological response to coffee as excitement about whatever Iâ€™m working on at that time.

Of course, once Iâ€™ve started on the project, I get into a state where Iâ€™m chugging along well after the coffee has worn off. The interesting thing is that the excitement remains.]]></description>
