		<description><![CDATA[[...] Spices are good for you, I blogged, because they are high in anti-oxidants. A new study, done in Singapore with elderly subjects, supports this conclusion. It found that curry-eaters do better than others on a mental test. The abstract: Curcumin, from the curry spice turmeric, has been shown to possess potent antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and to reduce ÃŸ-amyloid and plaque burden in experimental studies, but epidemiologic evidence is lacking. The authors investigated the association between usual curry consumption level and cognitive function in elderly Asians. In a population-based cohort (n = 1,010) of nondemented elderly Asian subjects aged 60-93 years in 2003, the authors compared Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores for three categories of regular curry consumption, taking into account known sociodemographic, health, and behavioral correlates of MMSE performance. Those who consumed curry &#8220;occasionally&#8221; and &#8220;often or very often&#8221; had significantly better MMSE scores than did subjects who &#8220;never or rarely&#8221; consumed curry. The authors reported tentative evidence of better cognitive performance from curry consumption in nondemented elderly Asians, which should be confirmed in future studies. [...]]]></description>
