		<description><![CDATA[After 3 days of taking 2 T of ground whole seeds every morning my desire to smoke has also decreased. It&#039;s day 5 and my desire has not returned. 

This is especially impressive because my smoking is tied to when I take my prescription for Adderall. Somehow methamphetamine no longer triggers the urge to smoke. 

I commented on this to my wife yesterday, calling it &#039;weird.&#039; And I just made the connection now, after reading this post. Very interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last night I took an Omega 3 pill before I slept and have had vivid dreams of my childhood. They were all happy memories of myself and my brother; interesting to note is that the memories were in chronological order, starting from when I was around 3 years old (yes i do remember  a few things) to 5, 7 years of age... They were kind of memories with a little twist to them; since in the dream I (as a by-stander) was watching myself and my brother ride the bicycle together, swimming and playing in the pool, etc... any medical thoughts on this ? Maybe I have experienced near-death !!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For four nights in a row now I&#039;ve had unpleasant, violent dreams that I can recall when I wake up, which I&#039;ve never been able to do.  I&#039;ve been taking a Fish, Flax, Borage OIl Supplement for the past 5 days.  I suspected there might be a connection, but after reading all of the above posts, I&#039;m convinced there is.  I just wish the dreams were pleasant.  I wish a medical professional would weigh in on this thread to assure me that the benefits of this supplement will outweigh these scary nights.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too have noticed an increase in vivid dreams while taking flaxseed oil capsules. 

This is especially true if I take a capsule before bedtime.

I began taking the supplement based on the recommendation of my pharmacist, who suggested that flaxseed oil would help my asthma. 

It has helped my asthma. 

So, long story short, I feel good and I sleep well. I will surely continue to take flaxseed oil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today I Googled &#039;Omega 3 dreams&#039; as, since I began taking Omega 3 fish oil tablets four days ago I have had the most astonishingly vivid dreams. I am an artist and illustrator and have always had vivid colorful dreams but very rarely anything like these. Three in a row just before dawn. Since Omega 3 is the only change in my diet I wondered if there might be a connection. Sad to read they might end soon. Oh well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just started taking a couple of Omega-3 capsules a day for mood last week, and the first three nights afterward I woke up completely remembering vivid dreams. That never happens to me. In the past I&#039;ve known that I must have dreamed, but never remember anything. I didn&#039;t have vivid dreams again after those first three nights, even though I&#039;ve continued to take the capsules, so there must be some sort of initial spike that happens to cause that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was just googling flaxseed oil and dreams, and found your website.

I have started taking flaxseed oil, and have found an unexpected pleasant side effect in the vivid dreams that I have been experiencing.  I recently was away on travel and didn&#039;t take my flaxseed oil with me and I didn&#039;t have any of these dreams (or that I could remember) while I was away.  I didn&#039;t immeditately begin taking the flaxseed oil when I got home as my new little habit had been interrupted, but when I started taking it again yesterday, I had a dreamfilled night last night!  Of course this is not scientific but I do believe I have discovered a correlation between the flaxseed oil and either increased dreams or the ability to recall them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Because many SLD dieters reported better sleep, I wondered if omega-3 improved sleep. I increased my omega-3 intake by switching from olive oil, which has little omega-3, to walnut oil and flaxseed oil, which have much more &#8212; especially flaxseed oil. The amount of oil stayed roughly the same. The night after the change, my sleep got better. To my surprise, so did my balance. The next morning, I found I could more easily put on my shoes while standing up. I had been putting on my shoes standing up for 2-3 years and it had never been this easy.

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Speaking of standing on one foot . . . I devised a way to measure my balance. (To recap: I want to measure my balance to see if omega-3 improves it. When I increased my omega-3 consumption via walnut oil and flaxseed oil, it suddenly became much easier to put on my shoes while standing, which I&#8217;d been doing for years. The omega-3 also improved my sleep. Maybe omega-3 makes much of the human brain work better, especially the most-recently-evolved portions. Maybe this effect happens within hours.)

		<description><![CDATA[In regards to flavor of walnut oil, how about pinching your nose closed while swallowing the oil?  I remembered from high school that smell affects taste significantly.  I&#039;ve found that when swallowing olive or other oil while pinching my nose closed and chasing that with a mouthful of water that I don&#039;t taste anything.

Shouldn&#039;t this work?  Heck, shouldn&#039;t I be able to eat other &quot;tasty&quot; foods this way and lose weight?]]></description>
