				<h2><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/12/eggs-and-insomnia/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Eggs and Insomnia">Eggs and Insomnia</a></h2>
				<small>January 12, 2014 <!-- by Seth Roberts --></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>It isn&#8217;t well known that eggs (large amounts) can cause insomnia nor that caffeine &#8212; in special cases &#8212; can reduce insomnia. But a reader named Baeo Maltinsky recently made <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/11/sleep-summary-of-what-ive-learned/#comment-1163569" target="_blank">those discoveries</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back around July 2012, I was trying to improve my diet but I didn&#8217;t want to give up my vegetarianism, so I started to eat a LOT of eggs, usually in the range of 10 to 14 per day. Not long after, I started having awful insomnia. I could lie awake all night just unable to fall asleep. There were suddenly just too many thoughts buzzing through my head keeping me up. I assumed that it was a result of ketosis disturbing sleep. I tried reintroducing carbs, but when that didn&#8217;t work I gave up on dietary modifications. I started cycling through OTC sleep aids, but I developed tolerance to anticholinergics very quickly.</p>
<p>By October 2013, I was going crazy. I couldn&#8217;t sleep well. It was making me depressed and seriously impairing my academic performance. I was exhausted constantly, but then I noticed something. I slept better when I consumed a lot of caffeine in the morning. I noticed there was a clear dose dependent relationship between how much caffeine I consumed and how well I slept. I had a hunch that the caffeine was depleting my acetylcholine levels, serving a similar function as OTC anticholinergics like diphenhydramine and kava.</p>
<p>I wondered what would happen if I sharply reduced my intake of acetylcholine precursors. A lot of people advertise eggs as &#8220;choline packed&#8221;, so I cut back to less than 3 per day. Suddenly, I was sleeping much better. Now, it could be something else in the eggs (I&#8217;m not really attached to my choline hypothesis), but either way I feel confident blaming them for my sleep troubles. My insomnia returns whenever I start eating them again.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him why he hadn&#8217;t realized earlier that eating so many eggs was the problem. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just didn&#8217;t think there was anything special about the eggs. I googled around for it and the only things I could find were about ketosis induced insomnia, so it didn&#8217;t occur to me that eggs specifically were likely to be problematic. I tried consuming enough carbs to knock myself out of ketosis, but when that didn&#8217;t improve the situation, I just assumed that something else was going on aside from diet. Eggs seemed like the perfect food. Cheap, nutrient rich, paleo, easy to prepare, and compatible with my (then) vegetarianism. It would have been hard for me to find a suitable replacement, so while the idea of testing it probably occurred to me, performing the test itself wouldn&#8217;t be trivial and the results wouldn&#8217;t be actionable.</p>
<p>As it got worse, I tried treating it more aggressively with OTC sleep aids, and that worked well enough that I stopped worrying about it. I wasn&#8217;t sleeping great, but it was enough to get by. Eventually they stopped working, but not long after that I made the caffeine connection and decided to try removing eggs. It was easier to do at that point because I had given up on paleo and vegetarianism and could just substitute chicken and sprouted lentils, and I had a (probably<br />
incorrect) neurochemical explanation to support it. Moreover, it had become VERY difficult to eat the eggs. My body just didn&#8217;t want to consume them and I had to slowly force them down. Something seemed to know it was bad for me, but I wasn&#8217;t listening to the signs. My behavior was not at all rational, and believe me after I discovered eggs were the problem I was kicking myself for not trying it sooner.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him what he learned from this, apart from how to sleep better. He replied:</p>
<ol>
<li>Costly experiments sometimes need to be performed.</li>
<li>Sometimes your values are bad for your health.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t give up just because there&#8217;s no evidence to support a hypothesis.</li>
<li>Simple things can easily go unnoticed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are good lessons.</p>

				<small>January 11, 2014 <!-- by Seth Roberts --></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Joseph Biederman is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. It makes a certain sense. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Biedermanb" target="_blank"><em>Wikipedia</em></a>, in 2007 he was</p>
<blockquote><p>the second highest producer of high-impact papers in psychiatry overall throughout the world with 235 papers cited a total of 7048 times over the past 10 years as determined by the Institute for Scientific Information.</p></blockquote>
<p>And he has won several awards:</p>
<blockquote><p>Biederman was the recipient of the 1998 NAMI Exemplary Psychiatrist award. He was also selected by the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society Awards committee as the recipient of the 2007 Outstanding Psychiatrist Award for Research. In 2007, Biederman received the Excellence in Research Award from the New England Council of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. He was also awarded the Mentorship Award from the Department of Psychiatry at the Massachusetts General Hospital.</p></blockquote>
<p>But there&#8217;s also <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/07/harvard_scientists_disciplined.html" target="_blank">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Biederman had pioneered the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents, a disorder previously thought to affect only adults. One of the world’s most influential child psychiatrists, Biederman’s work led to a 40-fold increase in pediatric bipolar disorder diagnoses and an accompanying expansion in the use of antipsychotic drugs – developed to treat schizophrenia and not originally approved for use in children – to treat the condition. However, Biederman and his colleagues Spencer and Wilens failed to accurately disclose the large consultancy fees they were receiving from pharmaceutical companies that make antipsychotics whilst conducting this research.</p></blockquote>
<p>For which Biederman received a slap on the wrist from Harvard.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/health/25psych.html?ref=josephbiederman&amp;gwh=C3A62AB351690D33D898CAE714EA391E&amp;gwt=pay" target="_blank">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Biederman pushed [Johnson &amp; Johnson] to finance a research center at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, with a goal to “move forward the commercial goals of J.&amp; J&#8221; [said Biederman in an email]</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, he felt no shame in admitting that he considered the commercial goals of Johnson &#038; Johnson more important than the health of children with severe problems. One of the few people who can really help these children &#8212; by doing good research &#8212; he preferred to help Johnson &#038; Johnson.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/10/man-beats-prostate-cancer/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Man Beats Prostate Cancer Without Surgery">Man Beats Prostate Cancer Without Surgery</a></h2>
				<small>January 10, 2014 <!-- by Seth Roberts --></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/12/cancer-free-i-beat-prostate-cancer-mish.html" target="_blank">This story</a> by investment blogger Mish Shedlock about a prostate cancer diagnosis illustrates the bias of doctors toward dangerous expensive treatments:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biopsy showed I had cancer. My &#8220;Gleason Score&#8221; was 6. The surgeon who performed the biopsy <i>strongly recommended</i> surgery. He gave me a cost of $20,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bad recommendation. Shedlock got rid of his cancer, as measured by PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) tests, without surgery or any other expensive or dangerous treatment.</p>
<p>The surgeon said something else also highly misleading. He told Shedlock he was &#8220;10% cancerous&#8221;. When Shedlock repeated this to his oncologist,</p>
<blockquote><p>The oncologist replied &#8220;That&#8217;s not correct. Of the 12 samples, only one had cancer and one was questionable. The cancerous sample was 10% cancerous.&#8221; Now that is a hell of a lot different than being 10% overall cancerous.</p></blockquote>
<p>His oncologist seemed unfamiliar with data:</p>
<blockquote><p>I informed the oncologist that I was going to have a PSA test every month. He commented something along the lines of &#8220;Why do you want to do that? Every six months is sufficient. The tests are not that reliable.&#8221;  . . . [I thought:] The more unreliable a test is, the more tests one should take to weed out erroneous outlier results.</p></blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of the dermatologist I had in graduate school. After I tested the two medicines he had prescribed for my acne, and found that one of them didn&#8217;t work, and told him this, he said, &#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221; Haha.</p>
<p>The oncologist predicted that the cocktail that cured Shedlock &#8220;would not do [him] any good&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am sorry Shedlock does not name the doctors involved, as <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/16/dr-eileen-consorti-and-patient-power/" target="_blank">I did in a similar situation</a>. I too avoided recommended surgery and my surgeon made highly misleading statements.

				<h2><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/09/reaction-time-as-a-measure-of-health/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Reaction Time as a Measure of Health">Reaction Time as a Measure of Health</a></h2>
				<small>January 9, 2014 <!-- by Seth Roberts --></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Six years ago I started using a reaction-time (RT) test (a test where you press a key in response to something as fast as possible) to track my brain function. I took the test daily. It must use only a small part of the brain but I assumed that something that made me faster would probably improve overall brain function. Behind this belief, which I call <strong>better RT, better brain</strong>, were countless studies of brain anatomy and physiology, which had shown that neurons and glial cells all over the brain share many features. Cells in different parts of the brain are much more alike than different. More support for this assumption was that <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">certain doses of flaxseed oil improved both RT and other measures of brain function</a>, such as balance.</p>
<p>I also assumed that changes that improved RT would probably improve overall health &#8212; what I call the<strong> better RT, better body</strong> assumption. It was less plausible than the <strong>better RT, better brain </strong>assumption because the cells in different organs of the body differ so much. They have many similarities but also many differences. I believed it for two reasons. (a) Flaxseed oil not only improved several measures of brain function, it improved my gums, no doubt because it reduced inflammation. It had been far from obvious that improving gums was so easy or that flaxseed oil (in the right dosage) would do so. The assumption <strong>better RT, better body</strong> had made a surprising prediction, you could say, that turned out to be true. (b) The brain gets much the same blood as the rest of the body. (Not exactly the same, because of the blood-brain barrier.) In the same way, all plug-in electrical appliances use the same house current. Just as all appliances have been designed to work well with that current, all our organs should have been shaped by evolution to work well with same mix of nutrients. You can&#8217;t feed your brain differently than your heart.</p>
<p>When I discovered that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">butter improved RT</a>, the <strong>better RT, better body</strong> assumption made a second even more surprising prediction: Eating more butter improved my health. This contradicted the claims of all mainstream health experts, who say saturated fats cause heart disease. I stuck with my assumption &#8212; I still eat a lot of butter. The data I&#8217;ve seen since then has supported my conclusion. For example, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/28/new-heart-scan-results-good-news/" target="_blank">my Agatston score got better</a>, not worse, after a year of eating lots of butter. The Agatston score is currently <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health-pictures/the-single-best-predictor-of-a-heart-attack.aspx#/slide-1" target="_blank">the best predictor of heart disease</a>.</p>
<p>I recently found more support for the <strong>better RT, better body </strong>assumption. Several studies have found that RT is a good predictor of health (better RT, better health). Even more impressive, it is a better predictor than many of the predictors we already know of. The RT test used in these studies is close to the test I now use, which I developed independently. The RT test in these studies involves showing a digit (0-4), after which the subject presses one of five keys (labelled 0-4) as fast as possible. My current RT test is very similar but uses 7 digits instead of 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15660853" target="_blank">A 2005 study</a> looked at the oft-reported correlation between higher IQ and lower mortality. The IQs and RTs of about 900 persons were measured in 1988. Deaths until 2002 were noted. RT was associated with lower mortality, even after taking out associations with smoking, education and social class. RT and IQ are correlated (better RT, higher IQ). When the RT-death association was removed, IQ no longer predicted death. So RT does a good job of capturing whatever it is about IQ that predicts mortality.</p>
<p><a href="http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/7.-Reaction-time-and-established-risk-factors-for-total-and-cardiovascular-disease-mortality.pdf" target="_blank">A 2009 study</a> compared RT to more conventional health predictors (&#8220;risk factors&#8221;). About 7,000 subjects were followed from 1984 to 2005. RT in 1984 was a good predictor of all-cause mortality compared to classic risk factors. Smoking was by far the best predictor, followed by RT. RT was a better predictor than physical activity, blood pressure, a questionnaire measuring &#8220;psychological distress&#8221;, resting heart rate, waist/hip ratio, alcohol intake, and body mass index.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17846257" target="_blank">A third study</a>, based on the same subjects as the 2009 study, found that amount of <em>decline</em> (slowing) in RT (from one test to a second test seven years later) predicted death. People with more decline were more likely to die.</p>
<p>All this supports studying how your RT is controlled by your environment, especially what you eat. You have to choose wisely what to study. The point is not to be as fast as possible regardless of everything else. Lots of drugs (stimulants, such as caffeine) decrease RT for short periods of time. I doubt they improve health. (If they harm sleep, they probably worsen health.) What makes sense is to look for two things: 1. <strong>Poisons</strong>. Things that slow you down. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">I discovered that tofu did so</a>. I gave several reasons for thinking that tofu affects many people this way, not just me. Billions of people eat tofu, unaware of this possibility. 2. <strong>Deficiencies</strong>. Study things that are missing from your life now but were likely to be present when we evolved. It is quite plausible that our ancient ancestors ate more omega-3 (in fish, but also in flaxseed) and more animal fat (from big animals, but also in butter) than we do now. My data suggest omega-3 and animal fat are nutrients necessary for health whose importance mainstream nutrition researchers have not fully appreciated.</p>
<p>My RT data have shown me there&#8217;s a lot I didn&#8217;t/don&#8217;t know about how my food affects me. Maybe everyone can say that. Unlike almost anyone else, however, I can reduce my ignorance myself. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/">I don&#8217;t need to rely on experts</a>.</p>

				<small>January 8, 2014 <!-- by Seth Roberts --></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Via a website, I asked about the flavonoid content of Dove dark chocolate. In China, a package of Dove dark chocolate has a picture of a heart &#8212; meaning the food is &#8220;heart-healthy&#8221;. <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4488" target="_blank">The heart benefits</a> are believed to come from flavonoids. Mars has been exploring this idea in various ways, such as <a href="http://www.cocoapro.com/about_cocoapro.html" target="_blank">this special process</a> and <a href="http://www.cocoavia.com/" target="_blank">these special chocolates</a>.</p>
<p>An email from Mars said I should call a hotline. The woman who answered did not know what flavonoids are. &#8220;Do you want to know the cocoa content?&#8221; she asked more than once. <em>No, the flavonoid content</em>, I said. She looked. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have that information,&#8221; she said. Haha!</p>
<p>I said the flavonoids in chocolate are believed to be responsible for the health benefits of chocolate. (That&#8217;s true, but I might have said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavanols" target="_blank"><em>flavanols</em></a> &#8212; a type of flavonoid &#8212; instead of the much broader term <em>flavonoid</em>.) &#8220;We don&#8217;t make health claims for our chocolates,&#8221; the Mars representative said. (As if a picture of a heart on a package is not a health claim. No doubt there is an important difference between US and Chinese law.) <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/dannon-settles-lawsuit/story?id=9950269" target="_blank">I can see why she would say that</a>. Our brilliant government, protecting us from crazy ideas such as chocolate and yogurt are healthy, but not from the <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/12/cancer-free-i-beat-prostate-cancer-mish.html" target="_blank">exaggerations of doctors</a> and drug companies. Which is more dangerous, (a) eating chocolate or yogurt or (b) being cut open?</p>

					<p><img alt="butter and heart disease over the years" src="http://www.dietdoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Butter-heartdisease650x460.jpg" /></p>
<p>This graph from <a href="http://www.dietdoctor.com/about">Andreas Eenfeldt</a> (via <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/weekend-link-love-274/" target="_blank">Mark&#8217;s Daily Apple)</a> shows heart attacks (left axis) and butter consumption (right axis) in Sweden over the last quarter-century.  Heart attacks have been going down, at least in men. What interests me is that when butter consumption suddenly increased, starting in 2006, <strong>heart attacks went down more quickly</strong>. If you fit a straight line to the heart attack rates for 1988-2005, you will see that the remaining rates (2006-2012) are below the extrapolation of the line, both for men and women. The Swedes made other dietary changes when they started eating more butter (the butter replaced other foods, for example). Nevertheless, these data make it more plausible that if butter has any effect on heart attacks, it <strong>reduces</strong> them, the opposite of what we&#8217;ve been told.</p>
<p>I eat a half stick (60 g) of butter daily. <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">It improves my brain speed</a>. After I gave <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">a talk about this</a>, a cardiologist in the audience said I was killing myself. I said I thought my experimental data was more persuasive than epidemiology, with its many questionable assumptions. The new data suggests I was right &#8212; butter does not increase heart attacks. It also supports my belief that by learning what makes my brain work best, I will improve my health in other ways (such as reduce heart attack risk).</p>
<p>No doubt a low-carb high-fat diet is better than what many people eat, but I believe the never-eat-sugar part of such a diet is a mistake. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">There are plenty of reasons to think sugars eaten at the right time of day improve sleep.</a> Whatever you think about nutrition, don&#8217;t get too comfortable.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><em><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/gatekeeper-syndrome/" target="_blank">Gatekeeper syndrome</a></em> afflicts many many healthcare professionals. People with gatekeeper syndrome dismiss or ignore any solution that does not involve them (or someone like them) being a gatekeeper and charging &#8220;toll&#8221;, i.e., making money. When I was a teenager, I had acne. None of the dermatologists I saw showed any interest in what caused it or even seemed to understand it was possible to learn the cause. All of them prescribed drugs (antibiotics) so powerful I had to see them again and again to get the prescription refilled. That&#8217;s garden-variety gatekeeper syndrome.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/health/adhd-experts-re-evaluate-studys-zeal-for-drugs.html" target="_blank">A recent <em>New York Times</em> article</a> about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) illustrates gatekeeper syndrome among professionals from whom you might expect better. The article describes ADHD experts at various universities wringing their hands: <em>Did we overemphasize drugs at the expense of &#8220;skills training&#8221;?</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Some authors of the [1999] study — widely considered the most influential study ever on A.D.H.D. — worry that the results oversold the benefits of drugs, discouraging important home- and school-focused therapy and ultimately distorting the debate over the most effective (and cost-effective) treatments.</p></blockquote>
<p>What about finding the cause(s) of ADHD? And getting rid of it/them? Maybe that would be a good idea? None of the experts quoted in the article even seems aware this is possible.</p>
<p>When an ordinary psychotherapist or doctor has gatekeeper syndrome, I think<em> they&#8217;re just a foot soldier</em>. The experts in the <em>Times</em> article are not foot soldiers. They&#8217;re generals. They are professors at world-famous universities, such as UC Berkeley and McGill, with enormous influence.  (One is a former colleague of mine, Stephen Hinshaw.) They don&#8217;t need to see patients and dispense treatments to make a living. They have assured income (tenure) and prestige. They enjoy freedom of thought.</p>
<p>Too bad they don&#8217;t use their freedom and prestige to better help the children they study and the tens of millions of children who will be diagnosed with ADHD until someone (not them, apparently) figures out what causes it. Instead, they study who should get the revenue stream that each new diagnosis provides.</p>

				<small>January 3, 2014 <!-- by Seth Roberts --></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>One reason personal science is a good idea is it is simple and immediate (in the sense of near). You study one person, you do experiments (easier to interpret than surveys), you can easily repeat the experiment (so you are not confused by secular trends &#8212; big changes over time &#8212; and implausible statistical assumptions), you are aware of unusual events during the experiment (so you are less confused by anomalous results and outliers), you are close to the data collection (so you understand the limits and error rates of the measurements). These elements make good interpretation of your data much easier. Professional science generally lacks some of these elements. For example, the person who writes the paper may not have collected the data. This makes it harder to understand what the data mean.</p>
<p>I hear criticism of (professional) science more now than ten years ago. Lack of replicability, for example. What I rarely hear &#8212; actually, never &#8212; is how often science critics make big blunders. As far as I can tell, as often as those they criticize. This is not to say they are wrong &#8212; who knows. Just overstated.<br />
An example is <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/2/311.full#ref-7" target="_blank">a critique of salt and blood pressure studies</a> I read recently. Many people say salt raises blood pressure. The critique, by Michael Alderman, a professor of epidemiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said, <em>not so fast</em>. The title is: &#8220;Salt, blood pressure and health: a cautionary tale.&#8221; It&#8217;s a good review, with lots of interesting data, but the reviewer, at the same time he is criticizing others, makes a major blunder.</p>
<p>He describes a study in which people were placed on a low-salt diet. Their blood pressure was measured twice, before the diet (Time 1) and after they had been on the diet for quite a while (Time 2). Comparison of the two readings showed a wide range of changes. Some people&#8217;s blood pressure went up, some people&#8217;s blood pressure stayed the same, and some people&#8217;s blood pressure went down. Alderman called this result &#8220;enormous variation between individuals on the effect of salt on pressure&#8221;. Oh no! He assumes that if your blood pressure is different at Time 2 than Time 1, it was because of the change in dietary salt. There are dozens of possible reasons a person&#8217;s blood pressure might differ at the two times (leaving aside measurement error, another possibility). Dozens of things that affect blood pressure were not kept constant.</p>
<p>Had there been a second group that did not change their diet and was also measured at Time 1 and Time 2 &#8212; and had the subjects given the low-salt diet showed a larger spread of Time 2/Time 1 difference scores than the no-change group, then you could reasonably conclude that there was variation in the response to the low-salt diet. To conclude &#8220;enormous variation&#8221; you&#8217;d want to see an enormous increase in difference-score variability. But there was no second group.</p>
<p>This is not some small detail. Alderman actually believes there is great variation in response to salt reduction. It is the main point of his article. <i>Spy</i> magazine had a great column called Review of Reviewers. Such as book and movie reviewers. Unfortunately there is no such thing in science.</p>

<p><em>Could you summarize the book?</em></p>
<p>It’s based on two ideas &#8212; that modern obesity is driven by two main factors. First, overconsumption of carbohydrates and sugars. Second, poor quality sleep. The medical profession has been saying that the cause of obesity is fat. We’ve known since the 19th century that it is carbohydrates, not fat. Poor quality sleep drives up stress hormones and appetite hormones. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/02/interview-with-mike-mcinnes-author-of-the-honey-diet/#more-12565" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>Here are some especially notable results (most notable first).</p>
<h3>Other People&#8217;s</h3>
<p>1. <strong><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/05/honey-at-bedtime-improves-sleep/" target="_blank">Bedtime honey greatly improved sleep</a></strong>. Stuart King found this after many other things had failed to help him. He got the idea from <a href="http://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-top-6-ways-to-improve-your-sleep-using-food/" target="_blank">Dave Asprey</a>, who got it from <em><a href="http://www.livinghoney.biz/the-honey-revolution.html" target="_blank">The Honey Revolution</a></em> (2009) by Ron Kessenden and Mike McInnes, but Stuart made by far the best case that the effect was important and determined some boundary conditions (e.g., don&#8217;t eat a lot of sugar during the day). The improvement is so big and easy (honey tastes good) that it&#8217;s quite possible this is why evolution shaped us to enjoy sweets after dinner &#8212; to improve sleep. In the future, I believe, it will be understood that sugars (at the right times in the right amounts) are a necessary nutrient &#8212; exactly the opposite of what all nutrition experts, <a href="http://www.dietdoctor.com/lustig-the-number-one-talk-of-ahs11-now-online" target="_blank">including paleo ones</a> and Weston Price, say. When this stunning reversal will happen I don&#8217;t know &#8212; but no one will have foretold it more than Stuart. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/31/the-year-in-personal-science/#more-12464" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

				<small>December 30, 2013 <!-- by Seth Roberts --></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/05/honey-at-bedtime-improves-sleep/">my first post</a> about the use of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">bedtime honey to improve sleep</a>, I included a graph that showed my legs suddenly got much stronger when I started the honey. I measured how long I could stand on one leg (bent). I had been doing this four times per day (left leg twice, right leg twice) for a long time <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf">to sleep better</a>.</p>
<p>A reader of this blog named Nile McAdams found <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/03/bedtime-honey-increases-strength/" target="_blank">bedtime honey caused him to get stronger</a>, too. He measured arm strength.</p>
<p>Soon after my legs got much stronger I reduced my one-leg standing from four/day to two/day to save time. The improvement stopped, but the gains persisted:</p>
<p><a href="http://s919.photobucket.com/user/twoutopias/media/2i013-12-30onelegstandingimprovedbybedtimehoney_zps94da9fcb.jpeg.html" target="_blank"><img alt=" photo 2i013-12-30onelegstandingimprovedbybedtimehoney_zps94da9fcb.jpeg" src="http://i919.photobucket.com/albums/ad40/twoutopias/2i013-12-30onelegstandingimprovedbybedtimehoney_zps94da9fcb.jpeg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Note the logarithmic <em>y</em> axis. Each point is a different day, an average of the first left leg stand and the first right leg stand of that day.</p>
<p>The graph shows I am much stronger with half as much effort. As I said, the strength improvement has also been easy to notice in everyday activities, including walking, stair climbing (I live on the top floor of a six-floor walkup) and bike riding.</p>
<p>I have been unable to find research that shows a similar effect. Judging by <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XOyjZX0Wxw4C&amp;pg=PA871&amp;lpg=PA871&amp;dq=%22exercise+physiology%22+sleep&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MtAoR5fs-e&amp;sig=OqVaNjvw6scXzY2CoqI8BqSG4zQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MWzAUt-PC4j0oATP5YJ4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sleep&amp;f=false" target="_blank">a 2010 textbook</a>, exercise physiologists don&#8217;t know about it.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>People who believe in &#8220;evidence-based medicine&#8221; say that double-blind clinical trials are the best form of evidence. Generally this is said by people who know very little about double-blind clinical trials. One reason they are not always the best form of evidence is that data may be missing. <span style="font-size: 13px;">Nowadays </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2013/12/lone-wolf-fda-investigator-says-clinical-trial-system-broken" target="_blank">more data is missing than in the past:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>By [missing data] he [Thomas Marciniak] means participants who withdrew their consent to continue participating in the trial or went “missing” from the dataset and were not followed up to see what happened to them. Marciniak says that this has been getting worse in his 13 years as an FDA drug reviewer and is something that he has repeatedly clashed with his bosses about.</p>
<p>“They [his bosses] appear to believe that they can ignore missing and bad data, not mention them in the labels, and interpret the results just as if there was no missing or bad data,” he says, adding: “I have repeatedly asked them how much missing or bad data would lead them to distrust the results and they have consistently refused to answer that question.”</p>
<p>In one FDA presentation, he charted an increase in missing data in trials set up to measure cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>“I actually plotted out what the missing data rates were in the various trials from 2001 on,” he adds. “It’s virtually an exponential curve.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Another sort of missing data involves what is measured. In one study of whether a certain drug (losartan) increased cancer, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324682204578515172395384146" target="_blank">lung cancer wasn&#8217;t counted as cancer</a>. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/10/health/10diabetes.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">another case</a>, involving Avandia, a diabetes drug, &#8220;serious heart problems . . . were not counted in the study’s tally of adverse events.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/EndocrinologicandMetabolicDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM218484.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a presentation</a> by Marciniak. At one point, he asks the audience, <em>Why should you believe me rather than the drug company (GSK)?</em> His answer: &#8220;Neither my job nor (for me) $100,000,000’s are riding on the results.&#8221; It&#8217;s horrible, but true: Our health care system is almost entirely run by people who make more money (or make the same amount of money for less work) if they exaggerate its value &#8212; if they ignore missing data and bad side effects, for example. Why the rest of us put up with this in the face of overwhelming evidence of exaggeration (for example, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html" target="_blank">tonsillectomies</a>) is an interesting question.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Yesterday I posted <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/26/lessons-of-this-blog" target="_blank">Kristen Marcum&#8217;s list of general rules</a> she&#8217;d learned from this blog. (For example, &#8220;be skeptical of experts.&#8221;) Behind her list, I think there is one idea, slightly hidden from view:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>non-experts can discover important things about health</strong></p>
<p>By <em>non-experts</em> I mean people who are not health professionals. People who do not make a living from health research. By <em>discover </em>I mean <em>learn from data for the first time</em>, actually discover &#8212; in contrast to learn from an expert. By <em>important</em> I mean stuff that matters to many people. (It&#8217;s obvious that studying yourself you can help yourself.) I haven&#8217;t heard anyone else say this, although it isn&#8217;t far from the Quantified Self movement. </p>
<p>The first example of this rule was the work of Richard Bernstein, an engineer with diabetes. In the 1960s, he pioneered home blood glucose testing, now enormously important. Another example, I hope, is my work. I used self-tracking and self-experimentation to find <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">important new cause-effect relationships in several areas</a> &#8212; new ways to sleep better or lose weight, for example. I believe my conclusions will turn out be true for many people, not just me, because they fit well with research done with other people and animals. I&#8217;m a professional scientist, which obviously helped, but not a health researcher. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/#more-12603" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

				<small>December 25, 2013 <!-- by Seth Roberts --></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>During the last week I have looked into the possibility that my sleep can be further improved &#8212; in addition to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">the bedtime honey improvement</a> &#8211; by eating a similar amount of sugar (fructose and glucose) a few hours before bedtime. After <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/20/dispatches-from-the-front-lines-of-personal-science-why-did-i-sleep-so-well/" target="_blank">I accidentally slept better than usual</a> (or even better than usual), I tried to determine why. Several things had been unusual the day before. Two tests (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/22/dispatches-from-the-front-lines-of-personal-science-progress-on-why-i-slept-so-well/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/23/front-lines-of-personal-science-more-progress-on-sleep/" target="_blank">here</a>) pointed to the sugar (honey or banana) a few hours before bedtime.</p>
<p>Last night (Christmas Eve) I tried again. I ate a banana (132 g, peeled) about 3 hours (7 pm) before I fell asleep (10 pm). I fell asleep within a minute and woke up, after an apparently dreamless night, feeling perfectly rested. On my 0-100 percentage scale (100% = completely rested, no detectable tiredness), which I have been using for about 8 years, it was the first ever 100%.  I had slept about 6 hours, a good amount of time.</p>
<p>To celebrate, I had a cup of black tea. I didn&#8217;t need it to wake up but I like the taste. I reflected that countless people had drunk tea or coffee to wake up. I had found a better way.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Discovery that an hours-before-bedtime sweet improves sleep (<em>in</em> <em>addition to</em> bedtime honey &#8212; that&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting) is significant not just for the obvious practical reason (better sleep) but also because it is the confirmation of a prediction. After I slept unusually well, I thought of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/20/dispatches-from-the-front-lines-of-personal-science-why-did-i-sleep-so-well/" target="_blank">six possible reasons</a>. The notion that sugar improves sleep pointed to one of them. The results of every test I&#8217;ve done (three nights) have agreed with that prediction. I believe <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5vt0z72k" target="_blank">the only real test of a theory (such as an explanation) is whether it makes correct predictions</a> &#8212; especially, whether it leads to the discovery of new cause-effect relationships. Many things people say haven&#8217;t passed that test. An example is weight control. That low-carb diets cause weight loss has been known since the 1800s. Many explanations have been proposed; not one has made correct predictions, as far as I know. In contrast, <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf" target="_blank">my theory of weight control</a> led me to <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">three new ways to lose weight</a> (sushi, low-glycemic foods, and fructose water).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">I doubt it&#8217;s a placebo effect because the sleep improvement has happened whether I expect it or not. A commenter named Paolo Paiva, after reading my posts about this, realized </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/23/front-lines-of-personal-science-more-progress-on-sleep/" target="_blank">something similar had happened to him</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Today I told my wife how deep I had slept and connected it to the 1 tbspoon of honey and 1 tbspoon of apple cider vinegar mixed with half a cup of water before bed (it tastes really good). Then I saw <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/23/front-lines-of-personal-science-more-progress-on-sleep/" target="_blank">this post</a> and remembered that yesterday I had had banana flour pancakes topped with honey 3 hours before bedtime!</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Paolo. May you continue to sleep well. May the rest of you sleep equally well.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
