		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you&#039;ve talked a lot about the health benefits of fermentation, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;ve discussed the role that vitamin K-2 may play.  (The only mention of K-2 on your blog appears to be here: http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/08/12/weston-price-and-the-olympics/)

(The mk-7 form of K-2 is created by fermentation, particularly in stinky cheeses and in Japanese natto.  And other forms of K-2, particularly mk-4, may be as important.)  

K-2 is crucial in the human body, because it activates a compound which the body uses to move calcium where the body needs it (the skeleton and teeth) and away from where it is a health hazard (the organs and the lining of the arteries.)

The additional K-2 Europeans get by eating more (esp. stinky) cheese may account for part or all of the &quot;European paradox.&quot;

some links:

In mice, high-dose K-2 _regresses_ arterial calcium deposits by 50% in six weeks (!) :

Damaged teeth can heal themselves with K-2 (with D3) [in the absence of the standard Western diet]:

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;m glad that you linked to Gretchen Rubin&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happiness-project.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;The Happiness Project&quot;).  Although she doesn&#039;t explicitly use the term &quot;self experimentation&quot;, that&#039;s exactly the approach that she used to determine ways to boost her own happiness.  See also her book, which I enjoyed very much.  She describes her book this way: &quot;My book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VJ9HRK/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;THE HAPPINESS PROJECT&lt;/a&gt;, is a memoir of the year I spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, the current scientific studies, and the lessons from popular culture about how to be happy--from Aristotle to Martin Seligman to Thoreau to Oprah.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeff R, you write: &quot;possible mental effects of fermentation . . . due to a dietary effect&quot;? I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about.

You can take Mark Frauenfelder&#039;s comments about fermentation to just be &quot;thinking home projects are fun.&quot; Maybe that&#039;s all he meant. But I think the health benefits of fermented foods put making them in an entirely different class from building a bird feeder. Making fermented foods is also much easier than conventional home projects.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark refers to fermentation as making him happy in the context of making things.  This is different from your discussion about possible mental effects of fermented food due to a dietary effect.  He also says that painting makes him happy.  This isn&#039;t really evidence for anything other than Mark thinking home projects are fun, which is not surpising or uncommon.]]></description>
