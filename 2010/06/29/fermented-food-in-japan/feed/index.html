		<description><![CDATA[mongolian, I think we can safely assume that fermented foods were part of almost any primitive society&#039;s diet. Lacking refrigeration and modern chemical preservatives, most stored foods would have been subject to fermentation. And, back when food was scarce, almost any surplus would have been stored for later consumption. (Back in the day, discarding the leftovers wasn&#039;t a good survival strategy.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth is definitely correct when it comes to the Japanese and French passion for food.  Most Americans take a much more pragmatic approach.  

I do think a lot of it comes form the fact that the French and Japanese generally eat less.  When you eat less,  your more selective about what you eat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pam Meier, by a &quot;strike&quot; you mean a stroke?

mongolian, traditional diets include plenty of fermented foods, in many different cultures. Fermented foods aren&#039;t only in Japan, they are just eaten there more than elsewhere. I can think of several possible reasons: 1. Modern foods, such as mcdonald&#039;s hamburgers and Coke, are less compatible with the Japanese diet than other diets. So they have been slower to displace the traditional diet. 2. Japanese food, being relatively mild, left a big desire for complex flavors that fermented foods fill. Other cuisines, with more complex flavors in their main foods, don&#039;t have that problem. 3. The Japanese are more food-conscious than other cultures, so they value complex flavors more. Certainly the French are relatively food conscious and also have a lot of fermented food.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If fermented foods are critically important for health, wouldn&#039;t more societies have evolved to include it in their traditional diets?  If the umami hypothesis is correct and humans are predisposed toward complex flavors due to the bacteria in them, then don&#039;t we see more fermented foods in diets around the world?  Why is it concentrated only in Japan?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a big proponent of fermented foods and encourage my patients to get more of them, but it&#039;s worth keeping in mind there are likely trade offs.  When over-consumed fermented foods probably irritating the lining of the digestive tract.  

East Asians have notably higher rates of stomach and intestinal cancer.  My gut feeling is that this comes from having acidic vinegary food so frequently that the digestive tract doesn&#039;t get a chance to recover.  I&#039;ve had to go off vinegar when I found my body had an allergic inflammatory reaction to it.  

It would be very interesting to see if people only need fermented foods several times a week to get the immune stimulating benefits, while not being as hard on the lining of the digestive tract (though now that I&#039;ve focused my thoughts, I suspect this may specifically be a vinegar thing; that stuff is strong, stronger than anything our tribal ancestors would have evolved to handle daily)]]></description>
