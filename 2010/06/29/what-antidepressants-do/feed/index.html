		<description><![CDATA[@B,
Thank you for your well thought and fair comment.  I don&#039;t jump to conclusions usually, but in these cases, if you think in a logical sequence about these crimes, you would have to admit that the facts are:
1.)  A medication was administered, in Melissa&#039;s Huckaby&#039;s case, many medications, and then 
2.)  The bizarre act or crime occurred.

The crime did not occur previously in the individual&#039;s life in the absence of the medication.  This would favor a causal relationship at a higher rate than not, since what you&#039;re implying, that these things would have been done anyhow due to the individuals&#039; underlying problems that the medication could not help.  (I&#039;ll give you Underwood, his situation is much sketchier b/c supposedly he planned this prior to being on Lexapro, but it seems as though he was quite unstable and insane and Lexapro was not the appropriate treatment, probably indefinite commitment would have been better.)  It would be impossible at this time to know if they would have committed these crimes in the absence of treatment with drugs.  Only if we could go back in time and not give the drugs would we know that answer.  That makes the likelihood of that theory much less than the causal relationship between the drug and the bizarre behavior.  Expecially in the case of Melissa Huckaby.   I can&#039;t imagine why someone in her immediate area, like relatives or counselors wouldn&#039;t have seen how drugged she was with that many drugs.  I would not be able to function on those, I can&#039;t see a person who could.  I am not saying that these drugs are all bad, it&#039;s just the way they are handed out and then with no follow up.  Everyone reacts differently to them because everyone has a different mix of chemicals in their brain and is sensitive in a different way.  Most people do not turn into criminals from SSRI&#039;s.  Case in point, my own trauma with Lexapro.  Supposedly, it takes weeks to work, I however noticed it&#039;s effects within minutes and developed full blown mania after only a few weeks which over months turned into delusional thinking.  However, it&#039;s quite possible that they have a more subtle effect on some people than once thought and that other factors that can&#039;t even be removed for the purposes of a trial, like the fact that someone is receiving a new &quot;treatment&quot; for their depression may be at work as well as a subtle effect of a drug.  These drugs have other effects than just increasing serotonin.  They also have the effect of causing cell growth in the hippocampus.  A long-thought culprit of depression caused by PSTD and alcoholism is a shrunken hippcampus and this is actually supported by imaging of the brain.  As far as alcoholism, and depression hundreds of years ago, I agree, people had different expectations for life.  They weren&#039;t as spoiled as we are, easily frustrated, they knew they had to work hard and things may not always go like they planned.  It&#039;s a known fact in countries where the gap between the rich and the poor is larger, the violent crime rate is higher.  This has to do with expectations, they see the high class with a lifestyle that they can never attain, and thereby, the frustration of the impossible is born.  If everyone is in the same boat, there is no need to take from my neighbor what I already have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@OpenUri, while all of the incidents you are mentioning are compelling anecdotal evidence, again once cannot assume causation from correlation.  Clearly there were extreme underlying struggles in all of the cases that you mentioned, which perhaps the anti-depressants failed to help, for whatever reason, but your post seems to imply that the anti-depressants caused the unconscionable behavior, an implication that I find difficult to support.  

For a slight paradigm shift, there has been some mention to the possibility of &quot;recovery over time&quot; and recovery throughout history from depression, history that existed before the invention of SSRIs or any other mood stabilizing drug.  I question the assertion that &quot;people recovered spontaneously from depression long before antidepressants,&quot; because it assumes an analogous relationship between experiences in the modern world, and experiences of some unstated time in the past.  We do not live in a world (though I should say country) in which people are outdoors, active, maintaining strong familial bonds (both emotional and physical), living in non-toxic environments, interacting regularly, face to face with other human beings.  I will not claim that these things are necessary to living mentally healthy lives (though they are necessary for ME to be healthy as an individual), all I am noting is that the world we are living in today is distinct from much of human history, even from that of our parents. Thus comparing peoples experience of and recovery from depression 50, 100, 500 years ago etc is not comparing like scenarios.  What if we are living in a society and culture that while productive in many ways, does not conform with the psychological needs of human beings?  In such an instance, short of changing our overall environment, the only treatment for depression would be treating the symptoms (medication being one route), and attempting to help the patient learn to cope in these psychologically unfavorable conditions.  

The other idea I would posit is that we do not know how people recovered from depression, since there was no &quot;clinical&quot; diagnosis and treatment of depression specifically, no advocacy for the people suffering from it, and a strong possibility that a lot of long-term self medication occurred (alcohol consumption, reckless behavior etc).  Furthermore, in a more survival oriented world, are our emotions put to better use (fight or flight) and thus not as prone to become problematic?  

On a more personal note, I am diagnosed bipolar, and being put on Lamictal (anticonvulsant, not an SSRI) saved my life, and has helped when diet modulation, exercise, strict sleeping regimens and talk therapy failed--not so much failed, but couldn&#039;t achieve functional stability.  This being said, my ultimate goal is not to be on medication, a goal I am working towards cautiously but steadily.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Kevin,

The question in the relevant medical literature isn&#039;t whether Prozac does something to one&#039;s brain - of course it does something, which is why it has so many detractors.

The point here *isn&#039;t* that placebos *aren&#039;t* effective, it&#039;s that they *are* effective at treating depression. That is, anti-depressant drugs are statistically effective, but not much more than a placebo, which in turn is also effective, with humans.

This isn&#039;t to deny that anti-depressants can also change one&#039;s biochemistry without a belief mechanism, as presumably it would do with dogs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I somehow stumbled on this website and am enjoying it.   On the point of ssri&#039;s and placebo,  I&#039;m a veterinarian and prescribe prozac often for separation anxiety in dogs and cats.  In fact my own dog takes it.  Without prozac she chews through a chain link fence trying to find her master.  With it, she stays in the yard.    Like acupuncture, there&#039;s no placebo effect in animals.  If the canine patient stops limping, it&#039;s from the acupuncture treatment, not a placebo effect.

		<description><![CDATA[There was probably not much wrong with Melissa Huckaby mentally until the community mental health system got a hold of her from her shoplifting conviction. She was diagnosed with depression (probably b/c her husband abandoned her and their child and never paid support.) She should have been diagnosed with poverty. At the time of the crime she had in her possession prescriptions that were prescribed to her for paroxetine, aprazolam, benzodiazapine, Xanax, Adderall, and others, in addition, she was using her grandmotherâ€™s oxycodin. Even one of these drugs alone may cause insanity, and per her comments, it doesnâ€™t seem like she actually remembered what she did, at least she didnâ€™t know why. For examples of other manufactured lunatics, there is Kevin Underwood, who, on taking Lexapro killed a neighbor girl with the intention of eating her, Alyssa Bustamante, a 15 year old girl who killed her 9 year old neighbor after being on Prozac for 2 years, the VA Tech shooter withdrawing from antidepressants, and the Columbine shooters on court ordered antidepressants. Doctors see you for about 15 minutes before prescribing these mind altering drugs, they operate like people who have had numerous and substanital head injuries. But it is unknown whether these were all prescribed to Melissa legitimately or if she went around to numerous doctors not telling them about the other drugs. (Like Michael Jackson.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Timothy Beneke, thanks for telling your story.
Could you explain how you managed to get to sleep earlier? Was it sunlight in the morning as you mention in your guest post? Anything else?. 
I am sure quality of sleep has an effect on mood. Many times I have nightmares or vivid dreams and I do not wake up refreshed.
Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since my articles are being quoted,  I thought I&#039;d clairfy some of the issues being raised by those leaving comments.

I find SSRIs extremely helpful when used properly.  My objection is to the notion that there is something wrong with serotonin in a  particular diagnosis.  While it is true that some people may be genetically predisposed to depression and a number of other troubles because of their serotonin utiliazation, so far the genetic contribution is relatively minor.  (At least what we can show so far.)  We do know that all kinds of environmental stressors can set off depression including experiences early in life.  And as many pointed out above, we  know that depression has physical effects that can be harmful in all kinds of diseases and may lead to some of them. 

 But that aside my article is objecting to over emphasis on biology, and the idea that a particular diagnosis,  presumably &quot;biological&quot;, should be treated with a given medication because it is &quot;evidence based&quot;  (ie when you group people by diagnosis and compare treatment with a medication to treatment with placebo it can be shown to be better than the placebo)  This is not useless information but it leads to a cookbook mentality to treament that ignores the particulars of each patient.  It leads to 15 minute once a month treatments since the patient&#039;s problems reduce to symptoms of the &quot;illness&quot;  and side effects. 
 My argument is that SSRIs and other meds have a particular PSYCHOGICAL effect which accounts for their usefulness.  Increasing serotonin (whether or not the patient started with a deficit) seems to lessen the intensity of emotions.  I call them the &quot;well whatever drugs&quot;  Clearly when helplessness, or sadness, or panic, or anger, or  doubt, or guilt, or any emotion is tearing you apart it is a great help to be able to get these emotions under control.  And SSRIs can then be a god send.  But I also have found them helpful in, for instance a thin skinned teenager who is getting picked on a lot.  SSRIs can supply the needed &quot;cool&quot;.  And so it goes for shyness (&quot;social phobias&quot; ) and other phobias.  But as noted in the blog, the downside is illustrated in the patient who was distrubed by her lack of reaction to her baby being in a not great environment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since my articles are being quoted,  I thought I&#8217;d clairfy some of the issues being raised by those leaving comments.</p>
<p>I find SSRIs extremely helpful when used properly.  My objection is to the notion that there is something wrong with serotonin in a  particular diagnosis.  While it is true that some people may be genetically predisposed to depression and a number of other troubles because of their serotonin utiliazation, so far the genetic contribution is relatively minor.  (At least what we can show so far.)  We do know that all kinds of environmental stressors can set off depression including experiences early in life.  And as many pointed out above, we  know that depression has physical effects that can be harmful in all kinds of diseases and may lead to some of them. </p>
<p> But that aside my article is objecting to over emphasis on biology, and the idea that a particular diagnosis,  presumably &#8220;biological&#8221;, should be treated with a given medication because it is &#8220;evidence based&#8221;  (ie when you group people by diagnosis and compare treatment with a medication to treatment with placebo it can be shown to be better than the placebo)  This is not useless information but it leads to a cookbook mentality to treament that ignores the particulars of each patient.  It leads to 15 minute once a month treatments since the patient&#8217;s problems reduce to symptoms of the &#8220;illness&#8221;  and side effects.<br />
 My argument is that SSRIs and other meds have a particular PSYCHOGICAL effect which accounts for their usefulness.  Increasing serotonin (whether or not the patient started with a deficit) seems to lessen the intensity of emotions.  I call them the &#8220;well whatever drugs&#8221;  Clearly when helplessness, or sadness, or panic, or anger, or  doubt, or guilt, or any emotion is tearing you apart it is a great help to be able to get these emotions under control.  And SSRIs can then be a god send.  But I also have found them helpful in, for instance a thin skinned teenager who is getting picked on a lot.  SSRIs can supply the needed &#8220;cool&#8221;.  And so it goes for shyness (&#8220;social phobias&#8221; ) and other phobias.  But as noted in the blog, the downside is illustrated in the patient who was distrubed by her lack of reaction to her baby being in a not great environment. (see my articles using the links above to find many other examples)  The point is how is it helpful and how is it not helpful to decrease emoional intensity.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Timothy, I&#039;ve often thought that many (perhaps most) depressed patients could benefit enormously by adopting common-sense measures, such as the following:

* Engaging in regular exercise, preferably exercise that is reasonably intense

* Going to bed earlier / getting enough sleep

* Adopting one or more pets

* Managing their finances better

* Learning how to get along better with their relatives

* Re-engaging in activities that they found enjoyable at one time

* De-cluttering their home environment and work environment

* Managing their time better (for example, spending less time on activities such as watching old sit-com re-runs)

* Improving their nutrition

* Taking care of long-neglected &quot;to do&quot; items

* If necessary, getting couples therapy (or perhaps breaking up)

* Starting some rewarding, long-term projects, like gardening or learning a musical instrument

Most mental-health practitioners would pooh-pooh such advice, though, as it doesn&#039;t involve high-status interventions, such as altering neurotransmitter systems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was a night person starting at the age of 18 when I went to college; before that starting in the summers at around 10 or so I would stay up late and sleep in, and was rather sleep deprived during the school year... 

As an adult I suffered from a lot of dysthymia and clinical depression -- I had a lot of suicidal ideation; I did a lot of therapy -- I suffered a very stressful and traumatic childhood and therapists encouraged me &quot;to uncover the emotions I was repressing that were at the root of my depression&quot;. I was even intellectually attached to psychoanalytic thought and published some theory; it was tied to a quest to save my self. At the age of 41 I started trying anti-depressants; between then and age 51 I tried 4 of them to no avail. 

Meanwhile I was going to bed at 3:30 in the morning and getting up around noon or later. I had also become obese. Seth told me that my biggest problem was going to bed at 3:30 in the morning, when I was 47. None of the therapists I saw ever told me this was a problem. 

At the age of 53, in early December of 2003, I finally started going to bed earlier, around midnight on average. Within a week or so I noticed a difference -- the sensation of getting sleepy at night began to feel bodily pleasurable. My mood got better. I was in the habit of getting quite depressed on Christmas day. On December 25 of 2003, I was stunned by the fact that I felt fine -- it was as if I had some magic protection. Soon after that, my love of music, which had been strong in my youth, returned in full force... I&#039;d say on a scale of 100 my baseline mood went up 20 points at least. I was not on any anti-depressants.

Then in 2006, I decided to try another anti-depressant. My baseline mood stayed much better but I wanted to see if one might now work; it did (Effexor). I think altering my circadian rhythms lifted me up substantiall; from their the anti-depressant worked... 

I&#039;ve mostly stayed out of depression since, though I am vulnerable to stress. I am happier. 

But the turning point was clear: finally following Seth&#039;s advice to get up earlier. I repeat: No one of the 3 psychiatrists and 3 clinical psychologists ever suggested to me that getting up earlier would help my depression... So depressed night owls might consider changing their ways....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;depression is due to defective entrainment of a mood oscillator. Itâ€™s caused by something missing from the environment.&quot;  
can you expand on this.  specifically is the &quot;defect&quot; of entrainment genetic?  Are you suggesting that some people are susceptible to depression due to their genes?  
  It seems to me that altho morning light (which i assume it what&#039;s missing from the environment) may make it less likely to succumb to depression, that most depression arises when people simply don&#039;t get what they want/expect, i.e., it a form of extreme unhappiness. 

[also, i goggled &quot;defective entrainment of a mood oscillator&quot; and was unable to find the phrase.  is it a phrase that is commonly used in psychology? ]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The FDA does not require all of the studies undertaken on efficacy of antidepressants to be submitted for analysis when considering approving these drugs -- it only requires two successful studies be shown, even if another eight were unsuccessful. Were the results of all the studies to be submitted together, these drugs would not be approved -- they do not produce results that can be distinguished from placebo.

The psychologist Irving Kirsch conducted a meta analysis of available research on SSRIs that showed 75% of the &#039;effects&#039; the cause are from placebo, and he proposes the remainder of that effect is because the strong side-effects of ADs make their placebo effect stronger. It would be great if ADs were tested against &quot;active placebos&quot; (placebos which also produce side-effects).
