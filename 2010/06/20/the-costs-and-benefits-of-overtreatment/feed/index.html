		<description><![CDATA[It would be relatively easy to knock your blog off the first page of Google results for &quot;eileen consorti.&quot; She needs to hire a good online reputation management consultant.

She needs to set up her own Web site, maybe at consortisurgery.com, and register it in various directories like Yahoo! Directory, Business.com, PR.com, and a few others. She also needs to register eileenconsorti.com, .org, and .net, and put some sort of genuine content on them. Having a domain name that is the same as a search phrase (minus spaces, no hyphens) will make ranking that website on the first page of Google&#039;s search results easy, especially for a rare search term like &quot;eileen consorti.&quot; Maybe .com can be a secondary business site, .org can be an information site about various medical topics, and .net can be a personal site.

Then she needs to set up Twitter, Flickr, MySpace, LinkedIn, Facebook, and other pages in her name. She needs to join every professional organization out there that offers outbound links to their members&#039; websites. The BBB often does this, but it depends on the locality.

She could start a blog or write guest blog posts for others&#039; blogs. She could release press releases. She can write articles. She can give interviews to various media. 

For some of these sites she needs to register them in directories, and there should be a certain amount of cross-linking among them (but not too much). The page titles need to be &quot;Eileen Consorti&quot; or that plus a few other words.

There are other things that she could do. It takes about 3 months to see the results. Once there is enough stuff online that outranks your site, it&#039;ll fall to page two, and hopefully to page three. Few people look beyond page one of Google.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I think you are incurious about incuriosity (other readers may have to be curious enough to follow almost all of Seth&#039;s links to prior posts and other comments in this post to see what I am talking about).  The incuriosity you notice and deplore among physicians and other professionals is for you simply a betrayal of humanity - you note that all babies and young children are curious, and something happens to them - in school (as you like to cite Robin saying) or in med school.  But surely this is too simple.  First of all, there are huge differences in the kind of curiosity that babies and children are born with (I have seen a wide range of curiosity even among the five babies that my personal magnetism has caused to bring into being - if I were inventing a language I&#039;m not sure I would have used a single word to describe the curiosity of each one of these people).  Secondly, even if curiosity in the very young is a useful adaptation, isn&#039;t it also the case for our species - which has existed in such widely different environments with such widely differing sets of competitors - that curiosity would be replaced with expertise - expertise which can, for most people, become adequate only by shutting down one&#039;s other talents and interests?  (If you have never come across the New Zealand anthropologist Peter Wilson&#039;s book &quot;Man, the Promising Primate&quot; (1979, I think), you can see an interesting theory about the unspecialized nature of our species and how it has shaped us.)  If Wilson is right, our species is good at nothing in particular, but through intense practice, individuals can become good through hard work at one thing, and relative neglect of others.  Wilson&#039;s insight was that the speech-act of &quot;promising&quot; - I&#039;m going now, but will be back on the 6:45 - was the originating communication that established us as human, because it recognized that most of us must do two things badly - be a husband and be a salesman, say - rather than one thing well, enabling us to perform 2 or 3 roles at once.
There was a grain of truth in Aldous Huxley&#039;s early account of the experience of what became known as &quot;psychedelics,&quot; that these drugs worked by destroying the filter between us and the assault of stimuli - and thus produced wonder and inutility (to put it mildly) at the same time.  One needs incuriosity fully to realize one&#039;s potential, as well as curiosity.
I have noticed that at a certain point in professional careers, for most people, it&#039;s only possible to maintain excellence and expertise by shuttering oneself from external stimuli and shuttering oneself in.  (Of course, I&#039;m sure that in professional schools, this notion is promoted far too early to people who are far too young.  And there are of course a few who need not do so.)  Let me give a counter-example.  Myself.  I am far more curious about more things than most people - I too noticed this about myself when I was a university professor in my late 20s and early 30s, teaching students who became less and less widely interested.   But when one has an essentially mediocre gift - as I seem to have -curiosity can lead one to fail or thrash about in many fields, rather than succeed in one.  Fortunately for humanity, I can say that one thing at which I have never failed, because I never attempted, is surgery.  But it seems churlish to complain that one&#039;s physicians tend to be incurious when - according to the commentators on this blog - the best experiences as a patient with surgeons comes from docs who superspecialize in one sort of operation, and see one sort of patient.  
I think that there is a kind of Hegelian Aufhebung of which people like, say, you are capable of - moving from wide curiosity, to special knowledge and expertise, to a higher curiosity.  Whereas between, say, a lawyer friend who declared to me (to my shock and disapproval) at the age of 45 that his ambition as a lawyer was never to have to learn any new law - and who remains an expert in his field - and me, who has tried his hand at so much and achieved so little that is lasting (with the exception of my children) - the world ought to prefer consulting my incurious but expert friend when it finds itself in the particular kind of jam he is good at fixing, rather than me, most anytime.
In any case, I think you fix on villains rather than heroes.  Overtreatment is bad, but it&#039;s a luxurious kind of evil.  Undertreatment or neglect is far worse.  Whereas the perfect match between necessity and solution is a miracle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[what i found noteworthy about the article was that 58 of the positive recommendations &quot;were based on no studies at all, only a &#039;consensus of expert opinion.&quot; and most of those received financing from cardiac-device makers or worked at institutions receiving it.  
&quot;This pattern â€” a paucity of scientific support and a plethora of industry connections â€” holds across almost all cardiac treatments, according to the cardiologist Pierluigi Tricoci of Duke Universityâ€™s Clinical Research Institute. Last year in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Tricoci and his co-authors wrote that only 11 percent of 2,700 widely used cardiac-treatment guidelines were based on that gold standard. Most were based only on expert opinion. &quot;

		<description><![CDATA[As I tell everyone who will listen:  Medical textbooks and journal articles are surprisingly accessible.  You might need to look up some terms in a medical dictionary (or search for them on Google), but with a moderate amount of effort, an educated layman can grasp the literature.

If you have any concerns about your treatment, go to the library at your nearest medical school.  The reference librarians are usually very helpful, even if you don&#039;t have any affiliation with the university.  You can also search PubMed (also called Medline) from home:
