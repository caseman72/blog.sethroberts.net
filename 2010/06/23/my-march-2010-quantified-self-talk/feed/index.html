		<description><![CDATA[Well, I tried challenging my body with 2 tbsp of butter yesterday after being dairy-free for a month. Half an hour after eating the butter (Strauss), I got a splitting headache, though not quite a migraine, that lasted for 9 hours. And I woke up in the middle of the night with a sore throat, stuffy nose, and wheezing. Both of these symptoms (headache/migraine and allergy-like symptoms) had been regular while I was eating cheese, and disappeared when I went dairy-free, but I wanted to do the butter test to see if it was the milk protein or something else. It&#039;s something else, but what??]]></description>
