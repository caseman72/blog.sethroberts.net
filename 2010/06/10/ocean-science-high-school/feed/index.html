		<description><![CDATA[Nick Currie calls this state of mind among many (most?) Japanese &#039;superlegitimacy&#039;:

The ecstasy of my train driver seemed to confirm something very important, a secret of happiness known to Collectivist societies like Japan and lost to increasingly, mistakenly Individualist ones like ours. Namely, that happiness does not lie in evading, avoiding, denying or escaping your social role, but in embracing it completely and joyfully.

I&#039;ve never been to Japan, so I don&#039;t know how good whether he&#039;s barking up the wrong tree or not, but I found his article extremely interesting:

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have a black or white opinion.  Certainly there are positive aspects to people taking pride in their jobs, but some slaves likely took pride in their work too.  A lot of people in society are performing menial service jobs for minimal renumeration, while others work much less hard and are serviced by the former - so one might understand how the former might be discontent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I noticed the same exceptional pride in work among the custodial staff at a mall food court in Buenos Aires. They were cleaning tables after customers had left and bussing trays and the like. They circled the food court tables like vultures circling dying prey and as soon as a customer left a table vacant, one or more of them would swoop in, clean it fastidiously and rapidly, and then move on in search of the next table to clean. They were quiet, unobtrusive, and seemed to genuinely take pride in what they did. They didn&#039;t put on an air as if it were beneath them, as I so often see among custodial staff in the US (particularly among certain sub cultures in the US, though not others).]]></description>
