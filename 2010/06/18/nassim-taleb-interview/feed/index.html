1. It will never work.
2. It is trivial. 
3. That is what we have been doing all along anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The human propensity to riducule new ideas is not a new idea; i.e. Kuhn.  What is surprising is a human being in the 21st century daring to challenge out-dated thinking.  The financhial disaster of 2008 and the war in Afghanistan prove that events have overtaken our ability to be responsible.  It is now only our ability to react to events that has overtaken our ability to see what lies before us.  And that puts us all in danger.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Taleb&#039;s ideas are useful, unlike those of most skeptics.  He used them to choose investments. I was influenced by them in my ideas about how science progresses (see my medical hypotheses paper). My theory of scientific progress has consequences. However his useful ideas can&#039;t be expressed as funny one-liners.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a fierce skepticism in Taleb&#039;s thinking.  He loves to tear down systems of thought

That&#039;s fine.  There&#039;s a role for him. 

But ultimately we do need to make tough policy decisions and to do that, we have to build systems of thought.  As William James argued, it&#039;s important to believe in something instead of being frozen by skepticism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The micro-econ and the time and motion guys have such tight math and their tools work so well that it seduces macro-economists into thinking that surely they should be able to duplicate the same effect of theory to practice.

But micro, in a way, is measurement that just happens to predict.]]></description>
