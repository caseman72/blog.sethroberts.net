		<description><![CDATA[Chris, no I don&#039;t take the version with lignans. Thanks for alerting me.
vic, everyone else says omega-6 is proinflammatory. You seem to be saying the opposite. Am I misunderstanding?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t consume much omega-3 because I hate the smell and taste of fish (and fish oil), but I do consume tons of nuts and seeds (some walnuts that have ALA omega-3, but also lots of omega-6, and no flax) that are rich in omega-6 and my most recent CRP was .18 mg/L.   The reference range is less than 3 mg/L.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve found there to be a high correlation between omega3 intake and my acne. First thing I did was stop eating omega6 foods, which reduced the acne significantly. Eating lots of sardines in olive oil helped, olive oil alone was inflammatory. Using flax was OK, but I don&#039;t want to take tablespoons of flax per day. Ordinary cod liver oil didn&#039;t help at all, not that I could tell. The fermented cod liver oil, using gummi fish, was the most effective of all.]]></description>

Do you take lignan added Flaxseed oil? As I&#039;ve heard (from Dr. Weil) that without the lignan it could be problematic for men in particular and could increase likelihood of prostate cancer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have an opinion about DHA supplements. Haven&#039;t tried them. 

Your story about teeth staining is very interesting. Recently I noticed my teeth stained, which surprised me. I assumed it was due to drinking ice tea, but this doesn&#039;t make much sense since I had drunken lots of ice tea in the past without teeth staining. I had been continuing to take 3 T flaxseed oil every day -- but the flaxseed oil is old (I was in China) and possibly degraded. I had other reasons to suspect degradation and now you&#039;ve given me another one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I drink about three large cups of coffee per day.  My dental hygienist has always remarked about the large amount of staining that she finds on my teeth (hence, I get my teeth cleaned four times per year, instead of the more-usual two).  Since I started taking 3 1/2 tablespoons of flax oil every day, my teeth have become much less stained than usual.  I haven&#039;t made any other changes in my oral hygiene.  The last time I went to the dentist, the hygienist was amazed at the difference.  I wonder if the staining is related to some sort of inflammatory response?]]></description>
