		<description><![CDATA[Heh, this is my favorite comment from that &quot;Gawker&quot; article:

&quot;I was having lunch outside, and some girl asked if I could watch her bike while she went inside a store. When she came out, I asked how she knew I wouldn&#039;t steal her bike. She replied, &#039;You&#039;re drinking Kombucha, I knew it would be safe.&#039; &quot; 

I&#039;m not sure why so many people in that Gawker thread think that kombucha tastes terrible.  I&#039;d drink it even if I didn&#039;t think it had health benefits.  I suppose it&#039;s a bit like beer, green olives, or hot peppers -- you may not like it the very first time you try it, but it grows on you.]]></description>
