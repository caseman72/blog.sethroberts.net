		<description><![CDATA[I have to admit that I know very little about climate change and global warming, and my opinions are influenced by a sense of guilt-by-association.

What I mean is that the &quot;climate change deniers&quot; often seem to be similar to other conspiracy theory groups that I find very wrong-headed, like evolution deniers and holocaust deniers and tea partiers. Show me a climate change skeptic who is otherwise accepting of evolution, and I will pay attention; show me a Faux News viewer who is a tea partier and a climate change denier, and I tend to tune them out.

Okay, I admit that my logic is pretty sloppy, but that&#039;s the way I look at these conspiracy theorist clusters.

Besides, would a good family man like Al Gore lead us astray?
