		<description><![CDATA[[...] As humans we must have some innate level of genetics knowledge. We know to look for favorable traits when we search for a reproductive partner, and once we make that choice, we know that our children are supposed to look at least a little bit like us and share some of our traits. That&#8217;s why genetic research is so mystifying. It offers the opportunity to know why we are the way we are. Yet, some think that genetic research hasn&#8217;t lived up to its billing. I have to agree that it&#8217;s extremely disappointing that with all of the genetic knowledge that we&#8217;ve gained in the past 20 or so years, it hasn&#8217;t helped us cure any major diseases like Alzheimer&#8217;s, Parkinson&#8217;s, or any form of cancer. However, it still seems that plenty of good has come out of genetics research, and there is reason to hope that a lot more is on the way. Genetic Alliance would agree.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Science was surprised by the incredible complexity of the genome.&quot; Perhaps it would have been better to wait a while -- until after that complexity was grasped -- before making promises? The main alternative to studying how genes cause disease is to study how the environment causes disease. If the first route (genes) turns out to be more difficult than expected, it argues for paying more attention to the second route (environment).

		<description><![CDATA[The above articles are pretty good perspectives (especially the last two) and I&#039;m going to try and express my opinion in a less confrontational way. It&#039;s understandable that people expected a lot more from the genome project immediately. There was a misunderstanding on all sides about what was expected. But as the I am learning more about this history all the time, science was and still is, in fact, surprised by the incredible complexity of the genome. This complexity has really let us know how much we still don&#039;t know and how much promises of utopia (or dystopia) where naive. Our knowledge is still nascent. If you think about it, believing that we would understand the complexity of disease once the genome was mapped is roughly equivalent to thinking that once a child is able to understand the alphabet and maybe a few basic words, that child can go immediately to reading and comprehending James Joyce.]]></description>

Decent articles that give a basic view of the state of the science. We haven&#039;t &quot;cured&quot; disease yet because the genome is really really really complicated. All we have right now is some strings of correlation. But that isn&#039;t enough. And that&#039;s why we need to know a lot more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You also fail to listen to anything that doesn&#039;t support your view. You ignore the reality that the genome is only 10 years old. You ignore the reality that getting a patent in the US takes 15 years. You ignore the fact that no one ever said that mapping the genome would, by itself and without any follow-up research, cure disease. That&#039;s why we are saying you are ill-informed and don&#039;t understand genetics. Genes-protein-networks-environment. All of those components are required to understand disease. You only talk about one while you accuse &quot;the other side&quot; about talking about one of those. The problem is, &quot;the other side&quot; is not ignoring proteins and networks (OR environment)... you are. Not only are you ill-informed about genetics, you are ill-informed as to the scientific process.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genetic_disorders

These are all genetic disorders that we&#039;ve learned about since mapping the genome. There is also all sorts of other crazy stuff they can tell as well. Even trivial things like if you are a person who has wet or dry ear wax. No lie. It&#039;s ridiculous but true. I just don&#039;t understand how in the face of all this evidence you refuse to change your opinion.

I won&#039;t and I&#039;m sure cameron wouldn&#039;t hold it against you if you revise your opinion. But Sadie, Brice, Christian, Cameron, and I have ALL given examples as evidence that your opinion is based on faulty information and you are in fact wrong. There&#039;s really nothing else we can do to change your mind.

If you are a scientist who works on alternative treatment methods I could see how you would be bitter about not having funding. But the way you are so ill informed about the current research in genetics makes me sincerely doubt you are in any way at all involved in a related scientific field.

And I am out. Good luck in the future. I hope someday you will be happy with amazing developments that come out of genetic research.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[or what other approaches are you talking about that biology has taken attention away from? 

I am trying hard to think of any and I think therapy and the attitude that people have play a big role. But just because people with cancer who have more positive attitudes are more likely to go into remission doesn&#039;t make it a cure. In fact it needs to be coupled with actual medical treatment or else they most likely just die. Anyways I&#039;m trying to see it from your side but I guess I just need to know more specifically what you are saying.

The main problem I had with this article is just the giant sweeping generalized statement that genetics hasn&#039;t made any progress in the last 10 years. You seem like an intelligent person. You even got your news from a reputable source, But that was still just that authors opinion, not fact. And you are allowed to have your opinion as well. But I&#039;m trying to tell you that it has in fact made progress and just because you aren&#039;t hearing about it doesn&#039;t mean it isn&#039;t happening. Scientists almost by necessity aren&#039;t the type to step out in front of the world and make huge announcements. They are extremely dedicated to their work and about the only place they show it to other people is at science symposiums. The only way it makes it into popular culture is when we finally see the tail end of it being marketed to us as some new product or invention. They aren&#039;t going to say &#039;hey guess what we made a little progress&#039; and then get asked &#039;what does that mean?&#039; and then answer &#039;more research&#039; every time a new development occurs because they would have to spend all their time doing stupid interviews for newspapers, radios, television and internet bloggers instead of actually conducting research. Look up some scientific articles. They are out there I assure you. If you don&#039;t see them you&#039;re not looking in the right place.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>or what other approaches are you talking about that biology has taken attention away from? </p>
<p>I am trying hard to think of any and I think therapy and the attitude that people have play a big role. But just because people with cancer who have more positive attitudes are more likely to go into remission doesn&#8217;t make it a cure. In fact it needs to be coupled with actual medical treatment or else they most likely just die. Anyways I&#8217;m trying to see it from your side but I guess I just need to know more specifically what you are saying.</p>
<p>The main problem I had with this article is just the giant sweeping generalized statement that genetics hasn&#8217;t made any progress in the last 10 years. You seem like an intelligent person. You even got your news from a reputable source, But that was still just that authors opinion, not fact. And you are allowed to have your opinion as well. But I&#8217;m trying to tell you that it has in fact made progress and just because you aren&#8217;t hearing about it doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t happening. Scientists almost by necessity aren&#8217;t the type to step out in front of the world and make huge announcements. They are extremely dedicated to their work and about the only place they show it to other people is at science symposiums. The only way it makes it into popular culture is when we finally see the tail end of it being marketed to us as some new product or invention. They aren&#8217;t going to say &#8216;hey guess what we made a little progress&#8217; and then get asked &#8216;what does that mean?&#8217; and then answer &#8216;more research&#8217; every time a new development occurs because they would have to spend all their time doing stupid interviews for newspapers, radios, television and internet bloggers instead of actually conducting research. Look up some scientific articles. They are out there I assure you. If you don&#8217;t see them you&#8217;re not looking in the right place. There are scientific journals solely dedicated to genetic research. In the those journals are published experiments some successes, some failures, and with each of those comes progress.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard to find because using the genetic expressions to cure diseases is completely different from understanding that they are an underlying cause in pathology of the disease. Just like we understand cancer is caused by uncontrollable cell growth, it is one thing to know what is causing it and another to actually find a cure. But just for a second think about what you are expecting. That as soon as we mapped out the genes, you thought we would be able to change the expression of the genes in a living person/animal to treat someone. It turns out RNA and epigenetics are actually much more responsible for the physical expression of your genes. RNA is extremely more complicated due to the large number of types, mRNA, tRNA, rRNA , tmRNA, etc. The point is even when we understand what all these things do we still have to figure out how to actually affect single alleles on single genes which then get sent throughout the body to all the nuclei via RNA without messing up everything else. I can&#039;t really imagine anything more complicated to be honest. But that doesn&#039;t mean we are going in the wrong direction. It does seem to be extremely important. At least equally important as environment. I think environment plays a big, big role don&#039;t get me wrong. But as complicated as changing the gene expression in a human being can be, I think changing the environment is even harder. There are just too many factors. I just think you are being too impatient. 

What other methods would you suggest that focus on environment?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No offense. But I think that just sounds like whining. Biology only started getting  a disproportionate amount of money in the 70&#039;s. Before that it was the physicists. Things go in cycles. It won&#039;t be in biology forever. As the amount of data all this biology generates gets to a certain point, the processing of this information will become vital and then all of the biologists will complain that all of the computer scientists get all the money. The genome was only finished 10 years ago and the average FDA patent takes 15 years. So what does that tell you? Again, I think your expectations that once the genome was done that we would automatically start curing diseases vastly misunderstands the process of science. Isn&#039;t that ultimately what your blog is about? If you want to being attention to other methods then write a book and start a blog... wait. You still haven&#039;t answered the charge that even if you lock down environmental causality, you still have to understand the system that this environmental agent acts upon. External causality is not the end of the story. You are not a closed system!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are all sorts of diseases that have been linked to genetics The APOE-4 allele on chromosome 19 in particular has been linked to a lot of conditions such as alzhiemers as well recovery from traumatic brain injury. There are tons of other disorders and &quot;diseases&quot; which have genetic components that we can identify. The interesting, and I suppose you could say unfortunate, thing about the mapping is that it taught us about alleles which are basically like little switches that control the gene expression. These actually are largely influenced by the environment and the affects can be seen as far as 3 generations later (there were a lot of studies about how famines affected the grandchildren of the people who were food deprived on a genetic level). The point being genetics is just like the rest of science. We answered a very important question and it gave us more questions. How is that surprising? Science is always like that. Whether it&#039;s physics, biology, psychology, etc. As long as it is breaking new ground, why would you really expect that to be the end. Last I checked we aren&#039;t anywhere near knowing all there is to know in any of these fields. It is regrettable the answer wasn&#039;t so easy (and yes a lot of very smart people thought it was) but they couldn&#039;t see the whole picture because they didn&#039;t know what they do now obviously. Point is, we have learned a ton from mapping the genomes, you are over-simplifying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what you define as &quot;common diseases&quot; but that seems an arbitrary designation. Presumedly, once the mechanism of the genome and its&#039; products is better understood, yes it will lead to better medicine. We&#039;ve got the genome, but as I&#039;ve explained, there is still much to do. Once we understand exactly what a disease is, it will give us the best chance to combat it. You say you want more money to understand environmental causes for disease, but without understanding the mechanism, without understanding how any environmental agent acts on the body, all you are doing is establishing correlations. It&#039;s a start, but it&#039;s not the whole story, and correlations are certainly not going to cure anything. What you fail to understand is that annotating the genome takes a long time. Computers can annotate genes but annotation algorithms are inexact. So it takes a human to clean it all up. Science, especially genetics, is a slow, deliberative process. It&#039;s not a reality TV show, it&#039;s science, and it takes a while to get it right.]]></description>
