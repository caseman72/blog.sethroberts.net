		<description><![CDATA[Bryan, thanks for pointing that out, I&#039;ve fixed it

Dena, yeah, the whole article is good. I&#039;m glad someone is pointing out horrifying features of the justice system. However, Malcolm didn&#039;t convince me there was a miscarriage of justice. There were 91 phone calls between the mom and the murderer that weren&#039;t given another convincing explanation, other than that the mom and the murderer were working together to kill her husband.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The article itself - while quite long - is very worth reading. The particular law guardian at the focus of the story not only did not meet the child he was supposed to be representing, but also met up with the journalist (Ms. Malcolm) and spent several hours explaining to her his theory of widespread conspiracy. 

This fact, while brought to the attention of the court, did not inspire any less confidence in the law guardian. 

There is so much more context than in the piece you pulled out.]]></description>
