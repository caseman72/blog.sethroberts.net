		<description><![CDATA[q, lack of innovation by Detroit car companies was one reason outside forces -- foreign car companies -- took over much of their market. Of course, labor costs were another reason, so Detroit isn&#039;t the best example. Clayton Christensen has written a whole book about the way big successful companies stop innovating and often collapse (The Innovator&#039;s Dilemma). Heard of Digital Equipment Corporation?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, &quot;controls&quot; do not always get placebo (meaning inert substance or treatment).

For example most omega -3 studies are done with control group on omega -6 oils to guarantee &quot;positive&quot; effects of intervention. Were they given placebo (some inert gum, for example), results would be most likely quite different (as small effects seen in such interventions, and also studies of PUFA deficient diets, suggest). So correctly choosing the &quot;control group&quot; is another way to add bias to the study to prove what you want to prove, and then trumpet the results as being &quot;scientific&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike: The &quot;C&quot; in RCT means &quot;controls&quot;, implying they get placebos.  

One of the ways trials fail is when they shovel together a load of people with what seem to have the same symptoms, and assume their problems all have the same cause.  The fraction who actually respond to treatment, because the treatment helps with their actual problem, might be too small a fraction to be &quot;significant&quot;.]]></description>
