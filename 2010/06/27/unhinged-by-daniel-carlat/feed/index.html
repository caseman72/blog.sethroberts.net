		<description><![CDATA[How interesting that I only recently connected to your blog and now I find another common interest: psychiatry. I just heard him on NPR. My interest goes back to my work in psychiatry as a psychiatric nurse practitioner. Though I continued my love of health care through my writing, I quit medicine when MD&#039;s decided to be bought off and nurses were powerless to do anything. In hospitals, money speaks the loudest. If you wonder why health care is in the shape it&#039;s in, look in the garages of Docs practicing during the heyday of moneyed medicine-80&#039;s, 90&#039;s and 2000s until the collapse. They love pretty cars.... They also don&#039;t-or can&#039;t- speak out too loudly about each other because most of them were in collusion actively or passively. Money&#039;s a hard drug to refuse. Most MD&#039;s I know didn&#039;t include this MD whose blog I will now check out.

		<description><![CDATA[I with trepidation would love to send you my memoir to comment on as 
a child psychiatrist who is trying to humanize the psychiatric profession by showing how patients/therapists share the same kind of sorrow and often that the work to heal can be life saving. 
Dr. Carlat even if you think is less militant, has taken many steps to bring 
psychiatrists into being self reflective about how we practice. 
Sincerely, Nancy]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, yeah, the article you link to is a good example of the problem with Carlat. In that article he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Clearly, mental illness is a brain disease, though we are still far from working out the details. But just as clearly, these problems in neurobiology can respond to what have traditionally been considered â€œnonbiologicalâ€ treatments, like psychotherapy. The split between mind and body may be a fallacy, but the split between those who practice psychopharmacology and those specializing in therapy remains all too real.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That there might be something deeply wrong with therapy doesn&#039;t occur to him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Louis Menand has an interesting piece in the New Yorker a few weeks back on psychiatry, and is interviewed about it on Econ Talk.  A lot of it has to do with whether perfectly reasonable people are down in the dumps and whether they have a disease. In many respects, it confirms what most people probably suspect already in terms of diagnosing it.  This is sort of the first-order problem before, what this post seems to address, which is the problems of attempting to treat it given extant market incentives.  

Here&#039;s the interview link if anyone&#039;s interested:

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read the book, but I&#039;m not a big fan of Daniel Carlat.  He seems to specialize in mild, relatively uncontroversial criticism of psychiatry, as in this disappointing &lt;i&gt;NY Times article&lt;/i&gt;:

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/magazine/25Memoir-t.html

Seth writes that psychiatrists &quot;...do a poor job of fixing the problem.&quot;  I agree, but I would go further and say that psychiatrists often create long-term harm to the very patients they are ostensibly helping.  (Psychiatry has a long history of this sort of thing:  lobotomies, insulin comas, unnecessary tooth extractions, etc.)]]></description>
