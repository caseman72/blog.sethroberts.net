		<description><![CDATA[I recently participated in a documentary with Dr. Healy on the use of SSRIs in young children. It was done by Denmark National Radio 5/2011. He is spot on! I lost my 12 year old son to what I believe is fraudulent pharmaceutical marketing practice. I hope more will listen to Dr. Healy. Remember what they say about money and what some will do for it!]]></description>
