		<description><![CDATA[dustmouse, that&#039;s very interesting. What&#039;s the
&quot;on-again off-again blogosphere feud&quot; about? I agree that &quot;turning off common sense&quot; is a good way to describe what happens. Clark Hoyt, the Public Editor of the New York Times, recently claimed, seriously, that the sentence &quot;he walked into the room and started shooting&quot; does not mean that the two actions -- (a) walking into the room and (b) started shooting -- happened at the same time. See:

		<description><![CDATA[Hunh. There seems to be a parallel with lawyers, judging from an on-again off-again blogosphere feud that started a year or two ago. The bloggers and commenters who have studied law seem to have specific blocks when it comes to analyzing what people&#039;s words mean, as if law school overrides this particular application of logic and common sense and replaces it with a stylized formula -- one which appears nonsensical to non-lawyers.

Now that I think about it, I can see other professions that seem to have similar induced blind spots. Maybe it&#039;s even the rule, rather than the exception?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The last part is just wacked, ketogenic diets have been a standard treatment for epilepsy for decades, not so popular now since no drug company makes $ by pushing them, but our pediactric neurologist brought them up as a treatment option for our sons seizures once he is weaned.

		<description><![CDATA[QUOTE:
&quot;Part of the doctorâ€™s brain has been turned off by repetition of something that supports the status quo.&quot;

That&#039;s very interesting. My impression is that MDs are trained to think in a narrow, focused manner, and to reject as &quot;anecdotal&quot; any patient statements that don&#039;t match the Big Pharma orthodoxy. And conversely, I think that PhDs are more likely to be question-oriented, and to be on a lifelong quest for new information.

But, heck, what do I know about higher education? I flunked out of pre-school.
