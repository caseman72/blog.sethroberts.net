		<description><![CDATA[I think everybody can agree that small scale experimentation is good, as are large scale RCTs. And that putting emphasis on the rituals of method at the cost of genuine insight is a bad idea. And that it&#039;s all about opportunity cost as usual. So what&#039;s the problem?

I think it&#039;s that the ritual has been elevated into law, and that stops small scale experimentation from proceeding at its equilibrium, laissez-faire pace. If I&#039;m right, then what we&#039;re talking about here is not an epistemological question at all, but a political one. Those then turn on quite different considerations from what has been said so far, e.g. on the right to consent to experimental treatment, medical ethics and the like.]]></description>

 Even more fascinating was Bakan&#039;s study of the roots of Behaviorism in American Psychology. He discovered that the men who developed and shaped the Behaviorist school had all come from Protestant families in small mid-Western towns and had then moved to big cities [typically, Chicago], where the culture shock of the extremely heterogeneous population mix drove them to maintain some sort of control over their shattered moral framework by seizing on Behaviorism. Bakan did a careful analysis of the experimental reports published in the leading Behaviorist journals, and also of the papers that were turned down on the grounds that the authors had not done enough experiments to make their results statistically significant. He reanalyzed the data to show that the editors and reviewers routinely overestimated the number of experiments required for statistical significance, in effect treating experiments as a place holder for Protestant good works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeff, RCTs have their place, just as armed escorts have their place. At the moment they have too much place. They loom too large in the thinking of health professionals. It&#039;s not so much that RCTs are bad or worthless, I&#039;m not saying that at all. As you say, it&#039;s often good to do a better study. Sometimes that better study is an RCT. The huge mistake is ignoring non-RCT evidence. Claiming it isn&#039;t &quot;real&quot; or something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Jeff, &quot;We canâ€™t have doctors treating people based on anecdotes.&quot;

People conclude lots of things (correctly, in a warranted way, and tentatively) based on &quot;anecdotes&quot;. If we called them &quot;case studies&quot; would that make it better? 

Better questions - and more difficult ones - than a blanket statement about anecdotes or case studies: what kind of evidence is there in the case study? How strong is the evidence? What problems with it? What can we conclude with warrant based on this evidence? How can we fruitfully test is further? And so on.

If one can conduct an RCT, then sure, go ahead. How many doctors can just whip off one of these? Instead, they should prescribe based on the evidence base available, which should include careful evaluation of case studies and even anecdotes. To ignore them would be ... willful ignorance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
The focus on RCT&#039;s is to &quot;know&quot; things for sure.  Anecdotes, self-experimentation, cohort studies are all good for generating hypothesis.  But, you wouldn&#039;t want to say &quot;x causes y/ x prevents y&quot; without an RCT, or at least a lot more evidence than a few people doing self experimentation.  

You may be right that self experimentation isn&#039;t done enough, but there also needs to be a second layer of double checking.  We can&#039;t have doctors treating people based on anecdotes.  People think all sorts of crazy things about health. Like, their friend&#039;s cancer was cured by copper bracelets, or magnets, or gold, or a million other things.  Sometimes a correlation isn&#039;t causation, sometimes it&#039;s a placebo effect, etc..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robin, yes, that would make the point. Just to be clear, the comparison I&#039;m talking about is:

group A: randomized trials evidence only. All other evidence is ignored.

group B: all available evidence. Randomized trial evidence plus everything else.

I&#039;m saying the purists ignore valuable information (in addition to suppressing innovation).]]></description>
