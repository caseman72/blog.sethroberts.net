		<description><![CDATA[The healthy baseline redness is bound to vary from person to person.  Anemic persons may give a false impression of health.  

Is bleeding directly related to inflammation-levels?  Can I just feel more or less alright so long as there&#039;s no blood on my toothbrush?  

I am mindful to eat omega-3 and the dentist never has the least reservation about my clean bill of dental health.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There seem to be mixed reactions to flaxseed oil, as much as I&#039;ve read about it online. And one needs also consider that flax basically only has ALA and no EPA or DHA, which should be the two types most identified for their anti-inflammatory effect. Have you tried any fish based omega-3 oils to see what kind of effect they have compared to flax?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see a Meta-Rule: &quot;Don&#039;t consume anything that increases the redness of your gums.&quot; Here is a simple rule that some may deduce from that: &quot;Don&#039;t eat red popsicles.&quot; Just kidding. My brother is applying to dental school soon, and maybe he will be able to tap into this good fortune sometime in the near future. Weston Price did a nice job using snapshots of people&#039;s faces and of their smiles (teeth) to provide a &quot;window&quot; into overall systemic health. I agree that oral health is a great proxy for the state of the machine overall. Personally, increasing my animal lipid intake has improved my oral health (epithelial health, generally) and gave me a practical feedback loop to tap into for my own self-experimenting. However, I can&#039;t think of a good way to measure redness of gums, aside from high-quality photographs. I&#039;ll keep thinking, though.]]></description>
