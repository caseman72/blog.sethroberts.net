		<description><![CDATA[â€œ&#039;Wang Hui was just doing what anyone (in China) would do.&#039; The overseers of Dushu didnâ€™t agree, apparently. This seems to be why he was removed from his post as editor-in-chief of Dushu.&quot;

Yes, if you get caught you MAY suffer the consequences; however, that doesn&#039;t diminish my point.  Bribery, etc. is, relatively speaking, socially accepted in China.  If an American mother were to advise another mother to give a teacher $50 as a gift to enhance a child&#039;s grade, more likely than not, the American mother would be outraged.  If you were to do that in China, it would just be considered smart, sound advice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shamelessness in the town of Bell, California:

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_bell_salaries

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;8 Bell officials to face judge in corruption case&lt;/b&gt;

LOS ANGELES â€“ The mayor, the ex-city manager and six current and former officials of Bell were headed from jail to court Wednesday as residents of the modest, working-class suburb celebrated their arrest on charges of bilking taxpayers out of $5.5 million.

As former City Manager Robert Rizzo, Mayor Oscar Hernandez and the others were rounded up during Tuesday morning raids on their homes, residents across the city honked their car horns, burst into cheers and staged impromptu celebrations.

The eight were scheduled to be arraigned in court Wednesday on charges of misappropriating more than $5.5 million in public funds.

&quot;They used the tax dollars collected from the hardworking citizens of Bell as their own piggy bank, which they then looted at will,&quot; District Attorney Steve Cooley told a news conference in Los Angeles soon after all eight were taken from their homes in handcuffs.

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s face it.  Bribery and corruption are built into the Chinese system.  Sure, there is bribery and corruption in the West, too.  However, I dare say that even those who engage in it here, know deep down it&#039;s wrong.  I am not certain that is the case in China.  It just seems part of life that teachers, for example, are given &quot;gifts&quot; in order to boost a child&#039;s grade.  Money is given to judges in order to ensure that a prisoner either doesn&#039;t go to jail or his sentence is reduced.  Managers in charge of money for a corporation &quot;borrow&quot; some in order to start a business of their own on the side.  The list could go on and on.  Wang Hui was just doing what anybody (in China) would do.  Remember the Chinese attitude of disbelief at the downfall of Nixon.  How could Americans have got rid of their President over such a simple infraction?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder how social reality is so constructed for these people so that they  can give themselves prizes worth lots of money with a straight face. Or are they smirking? In the West there is some recognition that one is not in a position to objectively evaluate one&#039;s own work compared with others; that biases intrude.

Is it cynicism? As Gunnar suggests, do they in good conscience believe that they were deserving of the award? I&#039;m curious as to how they would rationalize it... It is said that corruption is widespread in China... Wow...]]></description>
