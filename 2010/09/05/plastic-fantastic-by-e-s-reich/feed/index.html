The thought is not only will they notice intentional misdirection, they also &gt;think tricky]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[vic: Couldn&#039;t it be both?  But scientific crooks are made, not born.  Nobody becomes a scientist intending a career based on deception; deceptiveness is much more richly rewarded in other fields. The institution defines an environment in which deception is rewarded more than it should be, and where scruples are valued less than they should be.  Each person responds to this differently.  Some thrive despite it, some thrive because of it, others languish or move on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bell Labs is famous for inventing the transistor. But according to Wikipedia, it wasn&#039;t invented there at all.  It was developed there, building on publications and a patent by an earlier worker,  all reference to his achievements being suppressed from the Bell Lab publications and patent applications.  I first read this fairly recently and confess to being Shocked about Shockley.  And the buggers bagged a Nobel for it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So Seth, the basic point is that scientific peer review is the same as in the liberal arts: garbage in, garbage out. Scientific peer review consists of reviewers performing a reasonableness check: assume the underlying data and data collection methods are correct and the paper will be good if the scientific method is applied appropriately? 

Since we know that science is largely about signaling, why wouldn&#039;t up and coming institutions invest heavily in institutionally mandated internal controls on research and data collection methods? Hire young, promising researchers, wait a few years for everything to ferment, and then climb the rankings.]]></description>
