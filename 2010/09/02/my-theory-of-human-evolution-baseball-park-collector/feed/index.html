		<description><![CDATA[Yeah Seth, but you just expressed a similar thing really but with algebra - Crom is fascinated by rocks and obsesses over small differences that interest no one else, hence they find him odd.  I didn&#039;t say it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; being excellent at something, just that it can lead to that, even if the &#039;excellence&#039; is just in perception and not in any bold outward action.  The baseball park connoisseur had some, possibly a bit inscrutable, excellence at looking at parks, but did not go on to be a park designer, for whatever reason.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By connoisseurs I mean people who get more pleasure from X than the rest of us and are more sensitive to differences between X1 and X2 (different versions of X) than the rest of us.

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan - Crom the caveman has a thing about rocks.  He stares at them, weighs them in his hands, and bangs them together.  Others think this is merely eccentric until he develops a new cutting-tool.  The impact of the new technology influences evolution.  

If I am right about Seth&#039;s idea, it&#039;s not connoisseurship just in the culturally fully-formed sense of joining a club and discussing it on the Internet - I think he means just the mental predisposition to focus on a favourite thing or a few favourite things.  Many people who grow up to be excellent at something can trace this back to early childhood - they were honing the skill or thinking about the topic just for the thing itself rather than to make a career or survive.  

It&#039;s specialisation by temperament and talent, not specialisation in the Marxist sense of &#039;division of labour&#039;.  

Do I have this right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Any theory of human evolution that depends on specialization can only apply to the last few thousand years -- perhaps as few as four thousand, perhaps as many as twenty.  Certainly some evolutionary adaptation has occurred in that time, such as Tibetans&#039; and Peruvians&#039; to high altitude, or Europeans&#039; to dairy in the diet, and perhaps widespread increased tolerance for crowding.  Nothing fundamental can have had anything to do with connosseurship or specialization, because they began far too recently.  You could make a much better case that agriculture is fundamental to who we are. 

A related argument, that extravagance is selected for in mating competition, applies throughout the animal kingdom, so there&#039;s enough time to develop endless variations, but there&#039;s nothing uniquely human about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was thinking of this theory today reading the Classical Heritage and its Beneficiaries by RR Bolgar today. He provides a complementary (and certainly similar) description of how a certain kind of connoisseurship developed:
