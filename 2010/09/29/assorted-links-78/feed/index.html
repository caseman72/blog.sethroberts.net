		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s an EASY way to consume butter?  I am still trying to figure out the recipe.
Here&#039;s an easier way:  put thick slabs of butter on a piece of bread and eat it.  If you don&#039;t eat bread, put lots of butter on your veggies.  Of course, not all butter is created equally.  I have found most commercial American butters to be insipid, if eaten alone.  However, I could eat grass-fed raw butter with a spoon, like ice-cream.  Unfortunately, it&#039;s very expensive.  Butters like KerryWood, imported from Ireland are good enough and not too expensive.  Anybody else here have a fav butter?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been in Tibet and they use fermented yak butter in their tea. It is the worst smelling substance known to man. The only thing worse is the taste.
