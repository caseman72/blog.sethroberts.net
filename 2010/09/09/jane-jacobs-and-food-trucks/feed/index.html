		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m way late to the party.


I think (Ryan) you’re taking the point and running away with it.  What we’re working with here is the idea that food trucks provide an avenue for innovation for culinary workers.   They can enter the marketplace with a new idea – a new baked potato – and test it out with the relative ease of food trucks.  Roberts is arguing that any economy that hopes to thrive shouldn’t constrain these measures, you’re saying the government should regulate food trucks heavily because they’re a burden to employers and taxpayers.

But that goes a little too far.  After all, it’s just a food truck – in most every case, it hits a pretty low ceiling.  If the demand for their menu grows high, this food truck won’t satisfy that demand with more food trucks.  Nor is he likely to satisfy that demand by parking outside the premium real estate of other restaurants, eschewing property taxes and proper health codes.  If the consumer is left to decide, most people usually prefer eating inside, on a table, in the confines of a restaurant.  That’s why restaurants are more profitable, and why they’re taxed more heavily.

All we’re dealing with here is giving good ideas a chance to reach the marketplace.  You can do that with food trucks, but if the consumer is left to decide what he wants, the food truck will only survive so long before it gets passed over for a restaurant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;We, as a people, decided the regulations we enforce on restaurant owners are important. Things like health standards, minimum wages, zoning ordinances and so on. Itâ€™s misguided to hold up food truck owners as examples of innovation or whatever, because the reality is they flout the very constraints we decided were necessary in the food industry and punish the real community builders by pocketing the better margins and stealing their business. &lt;/i&gt;

Some sloppy thinking here.  Who&#039;s &quot;we&quot;?  What&#039;s &quot;flouting the constraints &#039;we&#039; decided were necessary&quot;?  Do you know for a fact that they are violating &quot;health standards, minimum wages, zoning ordinances&quot;?  

You don&#039;t, because the trucks are not breaking the law; they&#039;re offending your sensibilities.

There are windfall profits to the first-mover, and the fact that one business takes traffic from another is just life.  Two years ago, I was one of the thousands checking Twitter and racing off at 1am to check out a nearby Koji fusion Korean truck.  But once I got there, the food was no biggie, and standing on a sidewalk in an industrial area with meat juice running down my arms wasn&#039;t exactly magical.  I never went again.  It was not quite as silly as the Tamagotchi craze -- sometimes you get hungry, but you never really &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; a Tamagotchi -- but it was still a little lame.

And now there&#039;s a stampede into the niche.  Eventually there will be more regulations as the bricks and mortar businesses complain.  

I think the alternative food truck thing is already overplayed, at least in LA (where it seems to have started.)  A clear signal is the fact that Sizzler is right now building a fleet of them.  Once people start to equate food trucks with Sizzler, they will no longer think of food trucks as interesting and kicky....they will be right back to the &quot;roach coach&quot; perception, and there will be a crapload of money lost on now-useless trucks.

And most of the new trucks are being built by companies with bricks and mortar outlets.  IE, Border Grill, an expensive downtown LA restaurant, has at least one truck.  But I wonder if people will be willing to pay the premium at the restaurant for something the truck dishes out for cheap, without even needing to schlep downtown?  (Koji&#039;s trucks can&#039;t damage their B&amp;M outlets; they don&#039;t have any physical outlets.)

I would be pretty fricking furious if I were a bricks &amp; mortar Sizzler franchisee, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Food trucks don&#039;t merely create jobs, they can create the best kind of jobs: Those that provide new goods and services. Unlike jobs created by building dams or highways.&quot;

Why do you say that dams and highways don&#039;t provide goods and services?  They may not provide buttered potatoes, but they provide electricity and transportation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think your generalizing from a relatively rare occurrence. Most food truck owners don&#039;t go from truck to brick and mortar. They go from truck to more trucks because the economics are better - they don&#039;t have any of those pesky commitments to anyone but themselves. 

We, as a people, decided the regulations we enforce on restaurant owners are important. Things like health standards, minimum wages, zoning ordinances and so on.

		<description><![CDATA[Ryan, in her later books on economics, such as The Economy of Cities, Jacobs tacitly recognized that her first book (about city planning) was actually a small part of a bigger picture. You can have all the old buildings, infill and short blocks you want but still do badly if other things are unfavorable. Food trucks are a way of helping small things (e.g., one person who wants to enter the food business) become bigger -- become someone who can afford to open a restaurant and has the necessary business skills.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d actually disagree. In many ways, food trucks are the anti-thesis of Jacobs ideas about what makes a good cities. Food trucks pay no rent, don&#039;t renovate spaces, operate mostly cash businesses, and have no vested interest in the neighborhood. In fact, in many cases they operate on incentives as big box retailers which is to identify lively, robust communities, and siphon out money from it. For instance, you&#039;re a restaurant who has worked hard to draw people/attention/other businesses to your surrounding area and navigated through the various regulations that the government forces business owners to jump over. Then a food truck - which is subject to none of those rules - parks outside your attractive location and takes away customers. (meanwhile, adding none of the benefits that you do - taxes, employees, etc) How would that be something Jacobs would support?

Food truckers aren&#039;t less powerful, they are less meaningful and valuable to communities. Rarely is this true, but I think governments are mostly correct in their reactions against them.]]></description>
