		<description><![CDATA[On the toad article, I can see that Karl&#039;s suggestion about inducing earthquakes is stupid but I don&#039;t see what&#039;s stupid or &#039;clueless&#039; about Friedemann Freund&#039;s comment - can you clue me in?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I&#039;ve noticed what John S. is talking about too, for a few days now.  I used a firefox add-on to create a fake email address for this comment because I don&#039;t trust that my real email wouldn&#039;t wind up in the hands of spammers.   
Yesterday I searched for an older post on different yogurt incubation times and your Google search results are full of the same words too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you been hacked somehow, or have I? I read your blog through Google Reader, and the title of this post (on Google Reader at least) has been replaced with the name of a certain drug used to treat erectile disfunction. The name of said drug is also scattered four times in bold throughout the text. 

In fact, looking at your feed I now see that the titles of the last ten posts or so have been replaced with the names of different erectile disfunction drugs.]]></description>
