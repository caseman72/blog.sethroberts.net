		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re right that &quot;science is self correcting when it matters.&quot; 

All your examples are from social science. I&#039;m a molecular neuroscientist who works in international development now, and I have seen both extremes. Frauds thrive in a non-peer reviewed &quot;foreign aid&quot; world, and succumb to their schemes in neuroscience much faster than do social scientists. Maybe it&#039;s because people do repeat their experiments, because it at least matters in order to publish the next result.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hal, I think that science really &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be that bad. I&#039;ll give you another example.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.madinamerica.com/madinamerica.com/Home/Home.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Robert Whitaker&lt;/a&gt; is sort-of the &quot;Gary Taubes&quot; of psychiatry.  Whitaker recently wrote a book called, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Epidemic-Bullets-Psychiatric-Astonishing/dp/0307452417&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The book details the devastating effects of psychiatric drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics, antianxiety agents, etc.).  The book is meticulously documented and is quite an impressive piece of scholarship.  The psychiatric establishment has had a love affair with psychotropic drugs since 1952, when chlorpromazine was introduced.  So we&#039;re going on 60 years here.

It&#039;s interesting to note that Whitaker used to be an insider, of sorts.  He worked as director of publications at Harvard Medical School.  He also founded a publishing company that covered pharmaceutical clinical trials.  He also worked as a science journalist for the &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;.  Because of his insider/outsider status, he was able to publish a scathing and cogent critique of psychopharmacology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gary Taubes accuses nutrition science of clinging to the false notion that fat is bad for you for over 50 years! He claims that evidence disconfirming that hypothesis has been plainly available for many decades, yet generations of scientists go along with obviously false beliefs because... well, he doesn&#039;t really say why. Apparently nutrition scientists are so dishonest and mendacious that they would rather propagate obvious falsehoods than upset the apple cart that is delivering them their grants.

Could science really be this bad?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Perhaps the takeaway is that science is self-correcting when it matters.&quot;

Yes. I think you have to take into account your &#039;modern Veblen&#039; thesis that most of what passes for science in universities has neither value nor importance. Errors in those areas will stand for a long time without correction. Errors in the valueable/useful  fields will tend to be corrected because there are reputations to made doing so. However, it still may require the old-generation gatekeepers to retire before it is career-positive to correct their errors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is scary indeed. Also, for a young scientist starting out, he/she would definitely want to become and insider rather than an outside. The incentive to ignore rather than correct the mistakes of an established insider is very great. And I guess most of the real science is done by those trying to make a name are quite young.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[True, they mean that a broad range of wrong answers are corrected, not just fraud. When a published result turns out to be wrong, it doesn&#039;t mean it was fraudulent, of course. People who say science is self-correcting have a mental image of science wherein important experiments are repeated by others in attempts to extend the initial results. In these attempts, the veracity of the initial results is confirmed (or not).  This view of science isn&#039;t terribly accurate -- in some areas of science experiments are so difficult or expensive or diffuse (it&#039;s unclear what&#039;s central and what isn&#039;t) that replication is rare. Anyone who seriously believes science is self-correcting should study the career of Ranjit Chandra.]]></description>
