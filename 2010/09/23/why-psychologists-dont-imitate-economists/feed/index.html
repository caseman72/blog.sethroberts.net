		<description><![CDATA[I think you have it a bit backwards. Psychologists won&#039;t start using large amounts of observational data because experiments are fundamentally better at answering questions. Imagine trying to do observational chemistry or observational physics! While economics has historically had to rely on imperfect observational data, I think more and more economists will start embracing experimental approaches. I think some of your own points actually are pretty good arguments for this line of thinking.

&quot;Experimental data is much easier to analyze than observational data.&quot; This is pretty much the point. For any given effect, you will have more power to detect the effect in a well controlled experiment than in observation data with uncontrolled variables. Sometimes you can correct for those uncontrolled variables, but almost always it is an approximation.

&quot;Study of the parts often influences study of the whole; the influence rarely goes the other way.&quot; With experiments, it is much easier to get at multiple levels of analysis, with observational data, there is a lower limit on how small you can go (usually related to privacy laws and the inability to record all decisions/environments). Some of the really large scale stuff will probably have to remain observational for similar technical limits, but experiments of groups of up to a few hundred people are feasible.

Also, correlation isn&#039;t causation. I agree it can sometimes be used dismissively, but it comes back to a basic point. In order to determine the direction of relationship unambiguously, you need to externally perturb one of the variables and measure the influence on the other variable. That is an experiment. There are sometimes natural experiments, but they can never be as well controlled as a deliberate experiment.

I will agree on one point however. Psychologists are chronically bad at math, and this holds the field back. Economists can add a lot to psychology if they bring mathematical rigor to the field, and learn how to design good experiments. I think the biggest road block for most economists in designing good experiments is know what tools they have at their disposal. Psychological methods have a long history and there is a lot of great paradigms to use in there.

One field that jumps out to me is the study of working memory. There are a lot of interesting findings there that economists could use to start predicting individual and maybe even group behavior. Other topic to learn about would probably be cognitive control/executive function (which desperately needs some better models and rigor), and attention, which relates to literally everything humans do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, out of curiosity, can you list a few important points that have come to be generally accepted as a result of the &quot;innovation&quot; you extol in the beginning, which psychologists have foolishly ignored. I&#039;m in neither field, but it strikes me that there are papers showing &quot;evidence from this&quot; and &quot;evidence from that&quot; supporting various hypotheses, but on how many important questions has a general consensus been reached as a result of these studies? Many? More than longitudinal studies employed by psychologists?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I wonder if there are studies that have been redone using the more sophicated data techniques of economists. My question is: Does it make a difference, not for one of two studies, but for the thrust of the basic conclusions in an area?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

M. Keith Chen and Jane L. Risen
JPSP 2010

Excerpts from the abstract:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After making a choice between two objects, people evaluate their chosen item higher and their rejected item lower (i.e., they â€œspreadâ€ the alternatives). Since Brehmâ€™s (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance [... but] the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if peopleâ€™s attitudes remain unchanged [...] We show this, first, by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold [...] The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm, and perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Psychologists rarely use observational data &lt;strong&gt;at all&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Social psychologists use observational data -- of a particular sort -- all the time.  They do it when they analyze mediation (or &quot;causal mechanisms&quot;) in the style of Baron and Kenny (1986).  Their data on mediators are almost always observational: the mediators are measured but not manipulated.  The analyses of mediation in these cases should be thought of as observational studies, with all of the difficulties that observational studies entail.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think we have nearly reached a point where the difference between psychology and economics  is the methodology, particularly since the content often overlaps.  That is, if you are using sophisticated statistics on observational data, you are doing economics; if you are running experiments, you are doing psychology.  A fair bit of training is required to do either well -- witness the number of graduate-level courses devoted to econometrics or psychological methods -- so specialization according to comparative advantage makes sense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt; Psychology studies smaller entities than economics. Study of the parts often influences study of the whole; the influence rarely goes the other way. This is why, when it comes to theory, physics will always have a much bigger effect on chemistry than vice-versa, chemistry a much bigger effect on biology than vice-versa. Method is different than theory but if you aren&#039;t reading the papers -- and physicists don&#039;t read a lot of chemistry -- you won&#039;t pick up the methods.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I share the intution... has anybody fleshed out the implications?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s going here is that by and large economists and psychologists have different objectives.
When psychology began as a science in the 19th century it defined itself as the science that studied -- experimentally -- conscious experience.  It asked questions such as &quot;How many simple ideas can be held in consciousness at the same time?&quot; (answer 3-4 clearly and distinctly).  Observational data sets aren&#039;t useful here.
Even though psychology is now the science of behavior, we&#039;re still interested in elucidating internal mechanisms that cause behavior, whether conscious, nonconscious, or physiological.  As an example, let me take Friedma&#039;n&#039;s famous billiards player.  He was happy the explain the player&#039;s behavior from the outside as if the player were a master of physics.  A psychologist would want to look inside: What thoughts does he have as he lines up a shot?  What sensory cues does he need to integrate to make an effective shot: light reflectance off the billiard balls? kinesthetic cues from the position of his body and hand as he holds the pool cue? kinesthetic feedback from the movement of his hand as he strikes the ball?  sensory integration of the visually perceived movement of the ball with the feedback from striking the ball?  Also: How does one move from being a novice billiard ball player to an expert one?  Is there explicit instruction?  Does one learn by observation?  If the latter, how does the learner figure out what aspects of an expert&#039;s movements are relevant and which are not?  What&#039;s happening at the neural level as the player contemplates and executes a shot?  Because these are questions about internal mechanisms, observational data sets are not helpful.  One needs careful experimental studies in which one might vary things such as light reflectance off the balls.
In this connection, let me note that one can find very sophisticated mathematical work in psychology, it will just be in areas that economists are unlikely to encounter, such as psychophysics (Fechner&#039;s law looks a lot like a utility curve, by the way) or in work in neural network theory or dynamical systems.
Finally, I&#039;d like to mention that the very first work I know of in behavioral economics never seems to come up in economists&#039; discussions of it, which tend to start with Simon and Kahnemann/Tversky.  It was work back in the 1970s by Skinnerian radical behaviorists on choice behavior in animals, pioneered by Richard Herrnstein (of the Bell Curve).  Skinnerians don&#039;t care about internal mechanisms, either.
If we were all social scientists from Mars studying the movements of &quot;automobiles&quot; on Earth&#039;s highways, you would collect large observational data sets about traffic flows.  Psychologists would want to capture several vehicles and look inside to see how they work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Practicing psychologists are people who work with one (or sometimes a few, as in group therapy) person at a time. This is so much taken for granted that the idea that one ought to look at large numbers of people seems foreign to them. I suppose this outlook tends to infect academics as well, especially as many of them do therapy too.

I do some work with abused children. I constantly run across therapists who are willing to offer firm opinions about someone&#039;s character or intentions based solely on discussions with that one person. Whenever I point out that several other people tell very different stories from what they&#039;ve heard, they mostly just look at me funny. It&#039;s sort of the same thing as if one were to conduct a trial by asking questions only of the defendant. This mindset doesn&#039;t encourage the sort of thinking that economists do.

This is so much taken for granted that the idea that one ought to look at large numbers of people seems foreign to them. I suppose this outlook tends to infect academics as well, especially as many of them do therapy too.</p>
<p>I do some work with abused children. I constantly run across therapists who are willing to offer firm opinions about someone&#8217;s character or intentions based solely on discussions with that one person. Whenever I point out that several other people tell very different stories from what they&#8217;ve heard, they mostly just look at me funny. It&#8217;s sort of the same thing as if one were to conduct a trial by asking questions only of the defendant. This mindset doesn&#8217;t encourage the sort of thinking that economists do. It also doesn&#8217;t tend to lead to accurate predictions: studies of how accurate therapists are at prediction things like dangerousness show them about on a par with coin flips.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a long history of working with observational data in personality psychology, as well as intelligence research. For example, researchers have been interested in understanding the relationship between working memory capacity and IQ:
http://www.interactivemetronome.com/IMPublic/Research/Temporal%20Processing/Intelligence/Research_Intelligence_Engle1999.pdf
More generally, studies of &quot;individual differences&quot; are widespread throughout psychology.

In any case, I completely agree that software and mathematical knowledge is a major limiting factor. I remember having a conversation with social psychologists where they wanted to use graphical models to analyze their data; they kept asking me, &quot;Can your model do this? Can your model do that?&quot; I told them that we can build a graphical model encoding any type of assumptions they want, which completely amazed them. Psychologists have put themselves in a very constraining analytical box, and I hope that we can revise the statistics curriculum (and force them to learn programming) in the future to enable more flexible thinking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I read the article but didn&#039;t find any impressive results in it. Maybe you noticed how no small number of results were emphasized. Instead, 20-odd conclusions were described briefly.

Matt, the big databases you refer to often measure things that depend on behavior, which psychologists study. For example, income reflects behavior. Sometimes these big databases include something very close to behavior, such as highest degree achieved. But a psychologist would think that income and highest degree achieved are poor measures of behavior because they are likely to depend on dozens of things, including many a psychologist wouldn&#039;t care about (e.g., where you live). When you can&#039;t measure all the things that might affect your dependent variable, and it&#039;s observational (non-experimental) data, you get very nervous about concluding cause and effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Working from nearly zero information, I wonder if it&#039;s not harder to get good observational data that&#039;s of interest to psychologists. I gather economists do a lot of work with big, publicly available datasets collected by agencies whose job it is to collect them. If I knew about a large dataset that included variables of psychological interest, I&#039;d be interested. 

There are exceptions -- my ex-officemate Gary Lupyan has a recent PLoS ONE paper analyzing how morphology relates to number of speakers in a big database of languages. And it&#039;s obviously possible that many of these datasets exist, and I&#039;m unaware of them because of this very methodological bias.

(Unrelated, I have a bachelor&#039;s in computer science and don&#039;t touch SPSS if I can avoid it -- but R is gross in its own way, and I&#039;m getting more and more frustrated with how much effort it takes to do simple things. I&#039;m starting to think that Python with numpy and matplotlib may be the open source data analysis and visualization solution, not that I&#039;ve tested this hypothesis.)]]></description>
