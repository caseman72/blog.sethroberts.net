		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with @thehova.  Gladwell has been called out too many times. Many sports, but particularly football, are also rites of passage.  As such, risk of injury is a necessary component and likely adds to the allure.

On the other hand, although I agree that boxing has been mismanaged, I disagree with @thehova on MMA being more violent.  MMA is more bloody.  Because of the different types of strikes allowed (e.g. elbows), cuts are more frequent.  Also cuts to the head tend to bleed a lot, as does damage to the nose.

The big difference is that an MMA fighter can close the distance and clinch (nullifying much of the force that can be generated with a strike) and the referee will not force a break to maintain striking distance.  In boxing, striking distance must be maintained and striking must continue.  Repeated strikes to the head by a professional fighter are going to do permanent damage and can lead to death (not unheard of in boxing, but so far not a factor in MMA w/ only 2 deaths resulting from sanctioned bouts...I suspect these numbers could get worse as MMA gains popularity).

@Nathan I fly in and out of Korea.  More often than not, when the Captain addresses the cabin, he has an American accent.  Less frequently, I hear an Australian accent.  Only once have I heard what appeared to be a Korean captain address the cabin.

@Seth  My problem with Gladwell&#039;s article was that it left me with the impression that he was elevating the importance of long and violent struggle and discounting the possibility that less dramatic means, that take advantage of weak bonds, could facilitate change, perhaps without so much violence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your choice of the KAL chapter is interesting.

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a really interesting article.  Gladwell cites boxing as a sport which  witnessed a dramatic decline in popularity due to serious head injuries.  He sees it as a precursor to football.

But I don&#039;t think that&#039;s right.  Boxing has been horribly managed.  MMA, which is in many ways more violent, is better managed and extremely popular despite serious concerns about safety (indeed, it&#039;s illegal for MMA events to be held in many states).

I&#039;m sure many parents refuse to allow their kids to play football due to injury concerns.  The number of parents who do that will probably increase.  But when there is such a large demand for the sport, there will be players.  Football teams might have to compensate players more for the risks they endure.  But I find it highly unlikely the sport will disappear.  

Part of me really doubts that Gladwell fully believes that claim.  It often seems like he tries to be more interesting than accurate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gladwell claimed on a popular sports show that he strongly believed that football would end in the future due to the fear of concussion related injuries.

It&#039;s a major issue.  But to say the sport will end is beyond ridiculous.

There are other better examples of how Gladwell doesn&#039;t take empirical evidence very seriously.  It hurts his credibility.  

I find it difficult to take him seriously (I think that&#039;s a growing trend.  His popularity is diminishing).]]></description>
