		<description><![CDATA[Wyman, there are examples in Surowiecki&#039;s book where you&#039;d think it would be impossible for the crowd to do well. But it does. I haven&#039;t seen anything where someone correctly  predicts where this sort of crowd-sourcing will do well and where it won&#039;t do well. It was more informative to find out what the answer was -- how well the students would do -- than be sure I knew what would happen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This does not seem to be a very telling result. Surowiecki does not claim that crowds are good at baseless, or nearly baseless guesses, does he? On what basis would these students have been expected to have any idea that the actual number would turn out to be 2.7%? That example seems less like Surowiecki&#039;s go-to cases where you estimate the number of something like gumballs in a big glass jar, and more like asking a crowd for the exact sequence of cards in a deck of playing cards. This isn&#039;t &quot;The ESP of Crowds.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It isn&#039;t clear that this is a bad estimate if you asked them in this manner - giving them 2% instead of X%. 

Given the number of 2%, the number of gay men in the other population needs to be at least 8% in order to meet the intuition that at least 1/20 people are gay (I&#039;ve heard numbers ranging from 1/20 to 1/10).  

They may have accidentally used this heuristic of trying to get the overall number correct while trying to answer your question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating.  That said, i bet their answers would have been far closer if the question had been framed differently.  Imagine asking: &quot;How much more likely, in percentage terms (i.e. 100% equals twice as likely), is it that a boy will become a gay man if he has older brothers?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did the studies control for the mother&#039;s age at time of conception?  

I suspect there is a small social specialization effect, but if they didn&#039;t control for the mother&#039;s age, they might just be picking up that by definition of having an older brother, a younger brother is conceived later.  The older an egg is the more degraded its DNA, leading to a greater chance of a tuning error in sexual targeting.]]></description>
