 for their own needs and download in a convenient PDF format . Applications include medicine (for example WHO safe surgical checklist), aviation, adventure sports, and project management. The site was inspired by the book &#039;Checklist

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth -
I just recently read the Checklist Manifesto as well. I just wanted to add that in addition to checklists and introductions, the other key thing is the distribution of power on a team (key when nurses are reading the checklists to Doctors). Also the support from the higher ups to enforce said checklists is key.

Great post. cheers.]]></description>

As far as I can tell, it is not available for free from the publisher.  Am I missing something?
