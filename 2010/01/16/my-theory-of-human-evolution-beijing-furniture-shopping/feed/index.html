		<description><![CDATA[Diversity vs. conformity ...

Several years ago, when I needed new eyeglasses, I found it almost impossible to buy the large-lens style that I had worn for decades.

It wasn&#039;t that the frames were mot available.

The problem was that the sales ladies insisted that I should conform to the style of the season, with small lenses from French and British fashion designers with famous (and expensive) brands.

After about 15 minutes of arguing with them, I finally walked out when one of the ladies asked if I wanted my sons to be ashamed of me because my glasses were unfashionable.

It sounds like diversity may be more acceptable in Beijing furniture shopping than in my local optical shops.
