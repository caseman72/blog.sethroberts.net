A more parsimonious conclusion would be that some component of the fat -- and there are hundreds of chemicals dissolved in it -- had a mild sedative effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, what do you think is the crucial difference between animal fats and plant oils/fats that accounts for the benefit of animal fats?  Is it the degree of saturation?  Or is it not the fat at all but rather some other (non-fat) substance that&#039;s present in animal fats?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had this notion as well.

The first evidence of epilepsy being treatable through a ketogenic diet is old (1920s?), and through the years the idea has only been verified.

Yet it&#039;s still regarded as some anomaly, something that &quot;probably benefits only a bizarre minority of epileptic patients.&quot;

There&#039;s also evidence for ketosis being beneficial for people with Alzheimer&#039;s.

Furthermore, no one wants to make the connection that, maybe -- just maybe -- the clear and obvious benefits of a ketogenic diet towards epilepsy and Alzheimer&#039;s has some -- just SOME -- relevance to normal brains.

The brain is a peculiar organ in terms of metabolism, in that brain cells need glucose moreso than other cells of the body (the heart famously prefers ketones to glucose). I imagine there is probably some relation between the brain&#039;s unique metabolism, and the benefits of ketogenic diets.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The most ketogenic fats are the medium chain fatty acids. These fatty acids produce ketones even in the presence of carbohydrates. You can buy MCT oil over the internet. Coconut oil contains some medium chain fatty acids and to a lesser extent butter.

This is anecdotal -- I tend to begin getting sleepy in the evening. Lately for about the last several months, I have been consuming about 100 calories of coconut milk in the evening and that night time drowsiness has gone away.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did you happen to catch the last sentence of the article?

&quot;Max&#039;s brain is thought to have recovered enough that he is being gradually transitioned to normal meals.&quot;

Time to load poor Max up with sugar, corn, and wheat again!

Maybe Max&#039;s doctor should instead rethink his definition of a &quot;normal&quot; meal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I eat a lot of avocados,which are mostly fat.

I wonder if their fat would offer the same benefits as animal fat? (And they also have fiber, unlike animal products.)
