		<description><![CDATA[[...] This reminds me of Seth Roberts&#8217; insider-outsider idea in science &#8211; the idea that insiders (people with expert knowledge in an area) who are also outsiders (have markedly different personal resources than most experts in the area*) have an advantage. If a more-than-marginal breakthrough tends to come from &#8220;an idea that is not easily conceived of by the current population of&#8221; experts in a field, then it makes sense why an insider-outsider might have an advantage.

		<description><![CDATA[Probably most folks in the dance audiences disagreed with you - they enjoyed the more professional dances more, because they wanted more to be impressed.  Face it Seth, you and I are *weird*. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Michael. Someone told me about an iphone app for collecting data but he hasn&#039;t yet given me an example of actual usage. 

At a Quantified Self meeting I heard a presentation by a woman who was developing a website to help people self-monitor. I signed up for the website -- but never heard anything. I guess she&#039;s still working on it.

And I could tell you several other stories of potential applications for self-experimentation that went nowhere. I think the crucial thing is that the developer must have a problem that they themselves want to solve. So if you have a problem you&#039;d like to solve via self-experimentation, I&#039;d be happy to help you develop an appropriate iphone app or website.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth - 
I loved your talk at E.G 10!  You were impressive! hmmm...

Is there some kind of app on the web or iphone or whatever for assisting and informing self experimentation?

Should we make one?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, that&#039;s very interesting because you are correct that I cannot stand Patterson&#039;s writing. In that sense, just as you say, he is more like the professional dancers I didn&#039;t enjoy than the high school dancers I enjoyed. This puzzles me (why does his formula work with others but not me?) but there it is.

Adam, that&#039;s a good point -- that there are probably lots of other examples besides novelists, dancers, and scientists.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some similarities to the point made in this piece by Mark Twight at Gym Jones.
http://fwd4.me/CmJ
Dressing to impress, training for a certain look, doing the right workout routine, etc. does nothing for making actual gains in performance..that is why there is a distinct difference between gyms.  There is always an underground  feel to the gyms that will train you for performance and embrace experimenting.  Otherwise, you have to do it yourself in your garage, old barn, on the playground, or wherever...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:

I read the article about Patterson and it&#039;s fascinating.  But I don&#039;t think he&#039;s a good example for your discussion.  He&#039;s much more like the professional dancers you can&#039;t stand, than like the high school dancers you love.  He has a factory and churns out 9 books a year, doesn&#039;t seem to be doing a lot of self-experimentation in your sense, rather is working entirely within conventional forms.  And he definitely isn&#039;t doing it for himself, he&#039;s trying to impress someone--the mass audience, in this case.

I don&#039;t completely disagree with your main point (although I suspect that expectations are involved too; one reason the high school students are fun to watch is that you&#039;re expecting less from them in terms of raw talent), but I don&#039;t think that a mass-media figure such as Patterson who writes by formula, really works as an example for you here.]]></description>
