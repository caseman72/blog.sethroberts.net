		<description><![CDATA[Hello Seth, thanks for blogging. I have been following your blog for quite a while through the google reader.

I think it is great to have such access to the thoughts and musings of a professor - someone who is at the forefront of expanding the body of knowledge in their field. 

Can you point to any other blogging professors? I&#039;d like to start a category in my feed reader ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Frankly, I cannot even imagine how Brad can find the time to do it, so it doesn&#039;t surprise me at all that the rest of the professors don&#039;t.  I don&#039;t know how he is able even to  read all the things he&#039;s posting excerpts of and links to, never mind also post and comment on them, and read the ten times more other stuff that he doesn&#039;t end up posting.  No normal person could do all that and professorate besides.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ditto on that note of appreciation. I started coming here also through Marginal Revolution, and since I was already interested in the sorts of things Seth writes about, I stuck around. Around that time, Seth was discussing Taubes and the lipid-heart hypothesis; I thought I knew something about that and argued for it, but Seth was responsible, at least indirectly, for completely changing my mind. So thanks, Seth.

Also, that&#039;s an interesting observation about blogging and Berkeley professors. You&#039;d think they&#039;d want to have wide influence through blogging...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really appreciate the self-experimentation articles.  I eat flaxseed oil pretty regularly now, and my daughter takes fish-oil capsules. I have lost some girth -- albeit probably more from avoiding bread than from The Diet -- and now know a ready treatment for inflamed gums.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, thanks for posting all the interesting info.  I&#039;ve lost about ten pounds on your Shangri La diet (and still losing weight).  Not entirely convinced by your stance on climate change, but the information you post is always thought-provoking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a perfect place to send a note of appreciation, Seth.  

I came here initially from Tyler Cowen&#039;s blog, and since coming here my life is better.  How?  From fermented food added to my diet (especially kombucha!) , from the additional encouragement I found here to read Taubes&#039; book last year, and from the inspiration of your example of self-experimentation.  If changing others&#039; lives for the better is an additional motivation for you to blog, I&#039;m writing to offer your effect on mine as one datapoint.  Thanks!]]></description>
