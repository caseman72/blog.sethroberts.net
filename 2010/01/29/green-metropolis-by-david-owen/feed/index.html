		<description><![CDATA[I live in Chicago and, while I had a car for the first year that I lived here, it died two years ago and I never replaced it.  Chicago covers a greater expanse of land than NYC, to be sure, and the further away from the lake, the less likely you&#039;ll have easy access to the quick transportation of trains, but there are always bus routes to get you where you need to be.  While I haven&#039;t needed to sign up for the partnership between the CTA and ZipCar because I don&#039;t mind walking a few blocks to the grocery store, the option is easily accessible for those rare times I might need a car.

Besides, knowing I can only walk out of any store with what I can carry really cuts down on the over- and unnecessary buying.  Granted, I don&#039;t have childen, nor do I plan to have children, but I have friends with children who don&#039;t have cars, either.  NYC may have more train lines and a larger number of people who strive to be green, but Chicago isn&#039;t exactly lagging in this department.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;When we both lived in Berkeley it was easy to not have a car.&quot;  Then why do most Berkeley non-student households have cars? If you have children in Berkeley, you must have a car.

Re &quot;environmentalists&quot;. Sure, statements that this or that correlation is perfect are wrong. No actual correlations are 1.0. Not all environmentalists fit my description.  But Owen gave many examples of misguided envirornmentalism, so many that it painted the picture I describe: A large fraction of environmentalists work on projects that miss the point. Of course not all. Of course it is good to encourage bike riding and better public transit, for example.  The video-game quote sums up the book in the sense that a lot of environmentalists have a pro-nature anti-city bias that gets in the way of them doing things that help. Bill McKibben would be a more effective environmentalist if he lived in a big city. Then he would be exposed to the problems that need to be solved.  And he could write about how to solve them. McKibben is like an American academic who knows almost nothing about Africa but is quite sure he knows what should happen there for Africa to improve.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  You write, &quot;In large chunks of New York, unlike anywhere else in America, itâ€™s easy to not have a car.&quot;

When we both lived in Berkeley, California, it was easy to not have a car.  I didn&#039;t have one, and I don&#039;t think you did either!

I get your general point, but I think you&#039;re a bit too quick to make judgments on what is easy.  There are tradeoffs:  a car gives you some conveniences, and it creates other costs and inconveniences.

Regarding your last point, I think you&#039;re generalizing about &quot;environmentalists,&quot; just as you&#039;d similarly be making mistakes if you generalized about &quot;conservatives&quot; or &quot;liberals&quot; or &quot;religious people&quot; or whatever.  I also don&#039;t understand how that Owen quote is &quot;summing up the problem.&quot;  I agree that it&#039;s an interesting thought, but what&#039;s the point:  we all should be sitting inside playing video games (or blogging)?  Or is the point that it&#039;s ok to do outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, hunting, fishing, but only if you don&#039;t call yourself an &quot;environmentalist&quot;? Would Bill McKibbin be a better person if he&#039;d written a book in favor of consumerism?  I haven&#039;t actually read anything by Bill McKibbin, so maybe I&#039;m missing something here, but I don&#039;t see your point here.]]></description>
