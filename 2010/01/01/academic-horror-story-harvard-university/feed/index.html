		<description><![CDATA[&quot;[N]ew employee whining to him&quot;??

bc, this employee had good reason to suspect her peers of insider trading.  Hello?  Lawbreaking?  Corruption?  Playing havok with an esteemed institution&#039;s endowment and reputation?  Her motives were plainly good and not at all self-serving.  Yet you try to spin it like she went whining to the boss for a better stapler.  Why?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are two areas of concern here - investment and management. On the investment front I can&#039;t comment - I don&#039;t know that area - and my previous comment could be misread otherwise. My bad. 

My comments were only on Summers&#039; management actions. Sending employee complaints about how the business runs back down the chain is good management. 

The boston.com article but it is behind a paywall and there are so many details missing that it is impossible to say anything more. Depending on those details the actions of Summers and his management staff could be anything from exemplary to illegal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Was Mack naive? Yes. Of course new employees are naive. It is inevitable. Naivete should not produce such results.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m late to the discussion, sent here by today&#039;s Seth links. 

Andrew Gelman has it correct, although I might go further. It&#039;s the boss&#039; job to make their organizations run smoothly without constantly digging in and micromanaging. They will always get requests that skip levels and they will nearly always send them back down to the sender&#039;s manager to go and deal with it without bugging them. To do anything else undermines the intermediary managers and swamps the CEO.

Senior managers get a lot of &#039;my manager is screwing things up&#039; email, usually from people who aren&#039;t very good at their job. You can&#039;t tell how good Mack was, but she was a newbie in the org. 

Did Iris Mack know Summers? Did she know that he&#039;d want to listen to her comments? If not she&#039;s taking a huge risk and it didn&#039;t pay off. That was a painful way to learn a lesson. 

Ms Mack starts a new job and straight away goes behind her manager&#039;s back to mail really bad news to the CEO. No wonder she&#039;s no longer on the team. 

Now we don&#039;t and can&#039;t know the circumstances. Did she raise the problems with her team members and her manager? Did she go up the chain with her manager&#039;s assistance? How well did she communicate with her coworkers? Did her manager already know the problem? How big was the org chain? But based on what little is in that quote she sounds like someone I wouldn&#039;t want on my team. Maybe that&#039;s what Summers thought, too. 

Seth, it looks like there was no promise of confidentiality from Summers. The article mentions a request from Mack, but no promise from Summers. He&#039;s got a new employee whining to him so he sends it to the line manager. Yeah it&#039;s kinda rough since she asked for privacy but he&#039;s got a big organization to run, and yeah it bit him in the arse a few years later but there&#039;s nothing out of the ordinary with his actions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Peter, yes, I knew about the average fate of whistleblowers. Harvard isn&#039;t your average company. It claims to be &lt;strong&gt;much &lt;/strong&gt;better. (The average company hasn&#039;t received billions in charitable donations.) Nor Larry Summers the average CEO. He claims to be &lt;strong&gt;much &lt;/strong&gt;better. (The average CEO isn&#039;t high in the Obama administration.) It wasn&#039;t naive of Iris Mack to expect that a promise of confidentiality from Summers, the CEO of Harvard, would be respected.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i think we&#039;re speaking at cross purposes.  your distinctions are correct, but in a big picture sense, in my opinion, not terribly relevant.  if you google &quot;fate of whistleblowers&quot; several items are raised; i&#039;m not going to review all of them to see if promised confidentiality was violated, but it hardly matters if one&#039;s career is derailed; it seems to me that this is the important issue. 
e.g., &quot;The fate of whistleblowers is characteristically bleak in that if they have not already decided to resign they can expect to be dismissed from their employment.&quot;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4339/is_n2_v19/ai_20823856/

&quot;The conventional story--high-minded individual fights soulless organization, is persecuted, yet triumphs in the end--is seductive and pervasive. In speaking with whistleblowers and their families, lawyers, and therapists, Alford discovers that the reality of whistleblowing is grim. Few whistleblowers succeed in effecting change; even fewer are regarded as heroes or martyrs.&quot;http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/cup_detail.taf?ti_id=3501  WHISTLEBLOWERS

		<description><![CDATA[Peter, the promise of confidentiality is described here:

http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/3/31/hmc-analyst-questions-dismissal-after-a/

As far as I know there is no &quot;lawsuit&quot;. There was a settlement between Mack and Harvard several years ago. I suppose Mack released the documents she did because she thought the rest of the world should know what happened to her. I agree, obviously.
Promises of confidentiality to whistleblowers &quot;are broken all the time&quot;? I thought I knew a lot about what happens to whistleblowers; I haven&#039;t encountered this. Can you give an example?

Andrew, yes, Mack was a whistleblower in the usual sense. My point was that Brooksley Born was not. Born thought OTC derivatives should be regulated. That was why she got in trouble. Born wasn&#039;t criticizing her co-workers or boss.

I have the same question for you as for Peter. You seem to think that promises of confidentiality to whistleblowers are routinely violated (&quot;standard operating procedure&quot;). Could you tell me an example?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
in the article i don&#039;t see that Summers made a promise; and even if he did promises are broken all the time.  Mack does not have a cause of action (a legal claim) even if summers broke his promise (which i don&#039;t see from you excerpt). 
  Also, Shinseki&#039;s comments that resulted in his dismissal were made to a Congressional Committee; whatever duty of loyalty one has to one&#039;s boss, it cannot supersede the duty to speak truthfully under oath.  
  But why quibble; the larger point of the summers/mack episode and the examples i gave are same; there is an entrenched institutional mantra that is defended at all cost; the people at the top have an interest in the status quo and see themselves as indistinguishable from the institution, so that an attack of any sort on the institution is an attack on them and vice-versa.  That&#039;s the problem.  Summers is not any worse or better than anyone else.  They are all the same, that&#039;s how they get to the top.  They stay at the top (or in power) by letting everyone around them know that dissent(which might reflect badly on them) will not be tolerated.  Anytime any of them speak you&#039;ll notice that 80-90% of the comments are self-aggrandizing or defending their department.  This is especially true of Geitner and Bernanke.(just today Bernanke said Fed policy of easy credit played a small role in the housing bubble and that mostly it was caused by relaxed lending standards and exotic mortgages; of course, those 2 phenomena would not have been present without the easy credit provided by Fed policy; so his comments were just double speak designed to exonerate the Fed from it obvious responsibility;  It is not a coincident that there are are legislative proposals to audit or otherwise supervise the Fed and his comments were an attempt to thwart that effort.)
  Finally whatever the result of the Mack/Harvard lawsuit, her career is likely irrevocably damaged in the way that an Arm General&#039;s career would be damaged by being dismissed by the Sec. of Defense.  Even if Mack is vindicated by the lawsuit, the message to every employee is that same, i.e., keep your mouth shut or we&#039;ll ruin you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  I don&#039;t know what &quot;a whistleblower in the usual sense is,&quot; but someone going around saying that the people she&#039;s working for are thieves . . . that sounds like a whistleblower (in a very good way)!

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, Mack asked for confidentiality and was promised it.

Peter, the two cases you mention (Born and Shinseki) are both very different. from the Mack case. Born wasn&#039;t fired. A promise of confidentiality wasn&#039;t broken. She was much much more powerful than Mack. She wasn&#039;t a whistle-blower in the usual sense; she was simply trying to do her job as best she could. Whereas Mack&#039;s job description didn&#039;t include &quot;protect Harvard from your foolish superiors&quot;. As for Shinseki, of course if you publicly disagree with your boss, especially in the military, you risk being fired.  Mack didn&#039;t publicly disagree with anyone. Moreover, the power difference was much greater in the Summers/Mack case than in either of those two cases.]]></description>

She was much much more powerful than Mack. She wasn&#8217;t a whistle-blower in the usual sense; she was simply trying to do her job as best she could. Whereas Mack&#8217;s job description didn&#8217;t include &#8220;protect Harvard from your foolish superiors&#8221;. As for Shinseki, of course if you publicly disagree with your boss, especially in the military, you risk being fired.  Mack didn&#8217;t publicly disagree with anyone. Moreover, the power difference was much greater in the Summers/Mack case than in either of those two cases.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I donâ€™t think you see this sort of betrayal â€œin just about every organizationâ€. I canâ€™t think of a single example anywhere close to this.

a similar dynamics occurred in Frontlineâ€™s recent show The Warning tells where Brooksley Born was vilified.  what about Sec. Def. Rumsfeld firing of General Shinseki for not toeing the company line (if you recall Shinseki opined that about three times the troops would be necessary to keep order; Rumsfeld disagreed and the relatively small U.S. force was unable to maintain order allowed the looting/counterinsurgency to gain traction).  
   I&#039;ve seen this over and over again.  back biting, intellectual dishonesty and casual betrayal is rampant in every organization and, as far as i can tell, in many relationships.  
  What is notable about this story is Summers is as much a bungler as Bernanke and Geithner.  they all did well in school and were an integral part of the financial disaster(i.e., it happened on their watch); yet they are charged with fixing the problem.  They&#039;re fix?  to repeat the same mistakes of the past, i.e., liquidity (money printing) and low interest rates that will insure asset bubbles throughout the world and will render our money worthless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, thanks for your reaction. The &quot;bad thing&quot; that Summers did wasn&#039;t talking to Mack&#039;s boss -- it was telling Mack&#039;s boss who complained. He could have easily talked to Mack&#039;s boss about the complaint and kept her identity confidential. A Harvard Crimson article about this says (based on email documentation) that Mack was promised confidentiality.

I don&#039;t think you see this sort of betrayal &quot;in just about every organization&quot;. I can&#039;t think of a single example anywhere close to this. I am unfamiliar with many sorts of organizations but in the ones I know about I have not encountered anything like this. Until now.

My guess, based on the Born story, is that Summers decided that Mack should be fired and accomplished that by telling her boss what she&#039;d done. &quot;May I fire her?&quot; Mack&#039;s boss asked Summers. &quot;She&#039;s your employee,&quot; he replied. I am quite familiar with the dangers of whistle-blowing. It&#039;s plenty dangerous, but not -- in any other case I know of -- because the person you are writing to might decide you should be fired.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: 

My impression is that it&#039;s pretty much universal in organizations that if you go over your immediate superior&#039;s head to talk to a higher-level figure in the organization, he or she will go right back and talk with your immediate superior.  I agree this is a problem--it can be a huge problem--but it happens all over the place.  Whether or not it&#039;s &quot;pathological,&quot; it&#039;s hardly unusual for Summers to behave like just about every other higher-up.

I think this attitude is horrible, horrible, horrible, but it happens all the time, and there&#039;s often a huge amount of secrecy about who&#039;s talked with whom in an organization.  Higher-ups always like to follow the line of the hierarchy.

More specifically, I disagree with your implied claim that there was no reason for Summers to talk to Mack&#039;s boss.  (The basis of your claim of &quot;pathology&quot; is, I believe, that you&#039;re saying that Summers did something bad &quot;for no reason.&quot;

An obvious reason for Summers to talk with Mack&#039;s boss is for Summers to get to the bottom of things as quickly as possible.  The president of an organization is a busy guy.  Trying to handle this while protecting the confidentiality of someone he doesn&#039;t know . . . well, maybe that would be the moral thing (and, in this case, it would&#039;ve been the smart thing too, retrospectively), but, short-term, it takes a lot less of Summers&#039;s time to call Mack&#039;s boss, or Mack&#039;s boss&#039;s boss, or whatever, and delegate the problem to them.

It&#039;s amusing that Mack shares a name with the lowly turtle who quit his job and, as a result, toppled the mighty Yertle.  I wonder what&#039;s happened in the 8 months since the story came out in the newspaper.  It doesn&#039;t seem to have been enough (yet) to topple Summers.  I&#039;m of mixed feeling on this; on one hand, behavior such as Summers&#039;s is pretty horrible (here, I&#039;m assuming the claims in the news report are accurate); on the other hand, maybe it doesn&#039;t make so much sense to slam Summers for the sort of behavior you see in just about every organization; on the third hand, setting an example with Summers might motivate upper-level managers elsewhere to think more carefully; etc.]]></description>
