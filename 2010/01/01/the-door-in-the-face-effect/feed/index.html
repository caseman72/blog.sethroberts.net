		<description><![CDATA[Mike, you should the book version of Choke. It&#039;s much much much better than the movie. That&#039;s often the case and especially so with Choke, however with Fight Club (book by the same author) I&#039;d say the movie was slightly better than the book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is a fairly well established effect within the psychology of persuasion (nicely described in Cialdini&#039;s book Influence - or, rather one of the many variants of it).  I teach it in a course on marketing psychology.  On top of working (asking for a big thing and then backing down and asking for something smaller - which is then accepted), it makes the person that this is used against feel good about accepting the second request (after all, one has met the requestor half way).

		<description><![CDATA[hm, that reminds me of the movie &#039;choke&#039; i just saw, in which the main character induces choking in a restaurant in order to get someone to do the heimlich maneuver on him, and then these people tend to send him money, the idea being once someone saved your life, they&#039;d want to help you further.  to me the idea sounded implausible--it&#039;s slightly different than the above ideas in that it&#039;s about someone helping you in a big way wanting later to help you in smaller ways later.]]></description>
