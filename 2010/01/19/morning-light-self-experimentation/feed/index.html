		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;One, I wasnâ€™t angry during my commute via the subway.  If youâ€™re not from Toronto you wonâ€™t get this.  But if you are and you ride the rocket each morning, then youâ€™ll understand the general expression of, â€œangry defeatismâ€ on most commutersâ€™ faces. &lt;/i&gt;

You have just described the Budapest metro/subway during winter.

My guess, this a function of latitude.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The light exposure trick is something that has been relatively well known and practiced by Psychiatrists treating ADHD for years. A specialist I saw recommended it 4-5 years ago and itâ€™s wonderfully effective at getting me going in the morning, as well as keeping my internal clock regular (which is a classic problem for people with AD(H)D)

I do not remember the details, but according to him, certain wavelengths in the light trigger responses in your brain that resets your internal clock and helps wake you up. Unfortunately, this can only happen between around 6-9am due to whatâ€™s going on in your brain at the time. This is why you can actually be more tired and less pleasant after you sleep in, but also why people nowadays can have problems waking up. Itâ€™s especially important for folks with ADD to do it because our internal clocks are much more out of whack than average, but Iâ€™m sure it helps everyone.

The best way to do it is to get a wake up light that gradually turns on with a timer. Couple it with a full spectrum bulb and you can have a miniature sunrise right in your own room!

This, meditation, and Omega 3 are, by far, three of the most effective â€œhome remediesâ€ Iâ€™ve ever used.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve begun to start each morning with lights fully on. 

Seth, you should investigate whether practising the dual-n-back task improves your mood the next day. I think that it does mine. This might because it does some of the things that meditation might (I don&#039;t meditate).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have IKEA lamp as well ;) This one http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20370383 Solid performance for the price. 

I have full spectrum lightbulb in there - some 5000K. I keep it on as much as I can during the day (it&#039;s energy saving bulb) and switch it off soon after transitioning to ceiling lightning that has some 2000K full-spectrum bulbs for the later part of the day. Before sleeping time, I switch even those off and use just 2 small halogen lamps to keep a bit ambient light in the room - just enough to prepare for next day or do a bit of reading.

But that&#039;s not why I am writing this comment. I am writing it because I got an idea after reading this article. Next time I am in a DIY store, I will buy an electric socket timer, so I can program it to switch on my lamp automatically some time before my morning alarm. I hope this could make waking up more comfortable, especially in the winter.]]></description>
