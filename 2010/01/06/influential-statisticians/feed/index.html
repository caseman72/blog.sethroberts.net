		<description><![CDATA[Great post Seth. To add to the mix, in my own work, I would add Peter Bentler for his contributions to structural equation modeling and Reuben Baron&#039;s and David Kenny&#039;s papers on mediation vs moderation very insightful. 

As far as statisican-educators go, although thick and intimidating at first glance, Tabachnick and Fidell&#039;s Using Multivariate Statistics is superbly written. 

I wonder if there is a stats/methodology book on self-experimentation?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, thanks for the recommendation, the book sounds really interesting. Since a couple people have mentioned Tufte, I will say that I have learned nothing from his books. I find them annoying, starting with such titles as &quot;Envisioning Information&quot;. Tufte is, however, a genius entrepreneur.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BC Canada had a high school Probability &amp; Statistics grade 12 course in the 80s. I used Tukey&#039;s EDA and Tufte&#039;s books with considerable success. At its peak the course attracted as many students (especially girls) as the standard pre-university Algebra 12 course. 20 years later we hired a former student as my vice-principal who says that course was the best in his high school career. Then came the qualitative literacy movement (good) and the BC Ministry of Education mysteriously dropped the course (bad) to minimal protest (sad). Now there&#039;s piddling disconnected tidbits of P &amp; S in the K-12 curriculum. Bring back the good old days!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve used S-Plus and R for many years, but now work almost exclusively with R.  I&#039;ve filed many more bug reports for R than for S-Plus, so I find your suggestion that R has fewer bugs to be surprising.  Also, from my own experience, almost every semi-annual release of R has major changes that break my existing code.  S-Plus was much more stable.

YMMV.

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your list, Seth. Actually, because of you I bought a copy of Tukey&#039;s EDA and am working through it one chapter at a time. I finished chapter 4 last night. On to Chapter 5 tonight. It&#039;s great stuff!

I&#039;ve always been a fan of plotting data to understand it through visuals before even doing other summary stats and definitely before applying any inferential stats. You&#039;re right that psychology (maybe other science disciplines as well?) have really lost touch with this and overemphasize inferential stats.

I&#039;d add a purely graphing book to your list: Edward Tufte&#039;s The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.]]></description>
