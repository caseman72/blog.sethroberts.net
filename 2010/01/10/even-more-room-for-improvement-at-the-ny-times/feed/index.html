		<description><![CDATA[I was glad that she noted the lack of quality psychotherapy, rather than arguing for more prescriptions:

&quot;In 2008, a team of psychologists brought this point home in blunt terms in the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest. â€œDespite the availability of highly effective interventions,â€ they wrote, â€œrelatively few psychologists learn or practice these interventions.â€

I think it is worth reporting both the lack of efficacy of psychopharmaceuticals for much of what they are prescribed for, as well as the need for higher quality psychotherapeutic interventions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Judith Warner refers to a study which purportedly demonstrates that antidepressants work for severely depressed patients.  I haven&#039;t seen the study, but I have my doubts about that conclusion.  Based on the evidence I&#039;ve seen, I don&#039;t think the drugs work for anyone (that is, they don&#039;t work any better than a placebo).  See, for example:

http://www.spring.org.uk/2008/02/new-study-ssri-antidepressants-dont.php

For anyone who has an interest in psychopharmacology, I recommend a book called, &lt;i&gt;Blaming the Brain: The Truth About Drugs and Mental Health&lt;/i&gt; by Elliot Valenstein:

http://www.amazon.com/Blaming-Brain-Truth-Mental-Health/dp/0743237870/

Valenstein is respected neuroscientist based at the University of Michigan (actually, he may be retired now).  In this book, he debunks the fashionable but simplistic &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; theories that are so popular these days, especially among psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies.

(And, no, neither I nor Valenstein are Scientologists.)]]></description>
