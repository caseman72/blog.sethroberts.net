		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for the link to this article. You didn&#039;t even mention, the root of the study is new mass experiments that don&#039;t confirm the folklore science of influence that spews from the mouths of experts without data or confirmation. So much of our science is data-free posturing. Are we on the cusp of a new scientific revolution? One that finally jettisons the pretenses of academic theory and demands only data?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When talking about trends, it seems like it&#039;s not the first person who is influential, so much as the first group.  That is, first a group within a culture adopts a certain practice, then the larger culture adopts it or not.  The first person within the group is not so important, maybe.

I wonder if the same can be said of contagion.]]></description>
