		<description><![CDATA[Found this commentary rather interesting as a (probably) LADA diabetic, who was first diagnosed as Type 2 before the right docs looked at the tests and saw Type 1.  I think home blood glucose testing (by the time the sugar&#039;s in your urine, you&#039;ve been high for TOO long) can be equally as beneficial to Type 2s IF they are taught how to respond to the numbers on the little gadget and how to log and look for patterns.  The idea is to prevent as much long-term damage as possible and improve daily quality of life, right?  Really, I think well-trained diabetes educators (or similar educators for other conditions) can be just as beneficial to ANY person with diabetes as doctors.

And, in response to Jim above - tachycardia is not really going to tell you which direction your blood glucose is heading.  Your pulse can accelerate if your sugar is crashing, too.  Believe me - I have mistaken that sensation of increased heart rate for increasing BG levels as well, until I get out the meter and do a fingerstick.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily a Gatekeeper attitude that causes this.  I do think that people who have finished several years of expensive specialized education often become a little cynical about the intelligence of the public, and are unable to view patients as individuals: all recommendations must be suitable for &quot;the public&quot; and &quot;the public&quot; is stupid, and if you make a recommendation for someone intelligent and curious, you are in danger of having your recommendation followed badly by this great theoretical dumb mass of &quot;the public&quot;.  So if it can&#039;t be used by a cow, it&#039;s not valid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you asked Hypatia why prevention is ignored, but I&#039;ll give my answer also.

I think doctors neglect prevention for two reasons:

1. Doctors think that patients will be more likely to do something simple like taking pills, instead of making major lifestyle changes, even though lifestyle is much safer and effective than pills.

2. Doctors get reimbursed for doing something. And while prescriptions are a tangible action, just counseling patients about lifestyle may not be considered important or effective in the eyes of the insurers.

Health care reform will be meaningless if the only changes are in who pays for drugs and surgeries. The real change will only occur when doctors are rewarded financially for teaching patients how to modify their lifestyles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hypatia, long before they resisted home testing for Type 2 diabetics, doctors resisted home testing for anyone. And it isn&#039;t just these two examples -- acne and diabetes. Prevention is generally ignored. What&#039;s your explanation for why prevention is so ignored by American health care?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Blood glucose testing, or urine testing? For me, either could work, and it just becomes a matter of convenience and personal preference. Of those two choices, I prefer blood glucose testing.

However, I very much prefer an entirely different measurement: my pulse rate.

A fingertip pulse oximeter shows how my body is responding to food, with results much quicker than either blood or urine tests.

And as someone who has both Type 2 diabetes and frequent chest pains, I like to monitor both conditions.

The pulse oximeter results vary from the blood or urine tests, because I get very  rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) from bread and cereals (gluten?). Also, my pulse is affected is very strongly coffee and tea. Generally speaking, my blood glucose and my pulse rate move in the same directions, with some differences

But those differences are important, and my pulse oximeter has helped me identify and avoid foods that cause me to have very unpleasant tachycardia and chest pains.

A fingertip pulse oximeter is expensive, but no testing supplies are needed. A cheaper alternative for measuring pulse would be an ordinary blood pressure monitor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
While I usually agree with you, I am finding myself less convinced by your gatekeeper theory.  Type II diabetics, even if their blood sugar is well controlled, have to see their doctors on a regular basis to monitor their liver and kidney function.

But I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
