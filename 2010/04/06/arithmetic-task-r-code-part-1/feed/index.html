		<description><![CDATA[Seth, it may have worked for you, but because of character encoding weirdness there are some issues when pasting the code in some environments (for me pasting from chrome on OS X into my iterm emacs -nw session). R sees some of the quotes as \342, as well as some additional significant white space.

I&#039;ve cleaned it up a little bit and pasted it here:

Could you publish it to a pastebin?
