		<description><![CDATA[Mara, the article sounds reasonable. But the whole fancy food industry is booming, not just the spicy portion of it. Sushi, for example, is far more popular now than 20 years ago. Making a new spicy food is much easier than making a new bland food.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,
I was curious what you might think about this article (http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/10/07/some_like_it_hot/) which argues that the American appetite is becoming spicier as the large, aging Boomer generation â€œare losing their ability to taste â€” and turning to spicier, higher-flavor foods to overcome their dulled senses.â€ Are people mistaking spicyness for complexity, or are complex flavors like umami also affected by an aging person&#039;s gradual loss of tastebuds?

Cheers!
