		<description><![CDATA[Flash replacement is a sadly limited use of memristor properties, akin to using train cars as abacus beads.  It&#039;s what will happen, though.  If memristors don&#039;t succeed in displacing flash that way, that might be the end of memristors.  If they do succeed, we might eventually see much better uses that depend on fundamentally different models of computation.  The first such uses will probably be in specialized real-time image or signal processing, and others only decades later.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Found the reference from a cheeky Brit site called the Register.  A good read if you are interested in technology.

Here is the memristor link
