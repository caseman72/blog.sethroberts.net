		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m surprised you are joining the criticism of Goldman Sachs. You say they were being predatory in selling the bonds. But the bonds were known to be from spotty mortgages. They were basically a way for people to bet on whether those mortgages would be paid off. Investors got high interest rates in return for accepting the risk of default. But they took that risk voluntarily.

Goldman is accused of not telling investors everything about how the mortgages were chosen. But apparently the basic facts about the deal were available. It&#039;s going to be something of a judgment call as to whether Goldman was obligated to share everything they knew. Many observers are skeptical about whether the SEC will prevail in court (if it gets that far). Given the legal ambiguities, it&#039;s a stretch to call this predatory behavior.

In finance people take opposing positions all the time. Long vs short, buyer vs seller. Differences of opinion are what make markets possible. It&#039;s good because it means that voluntary trades make both sides happier. Plus these transactions benefit bystanders by providing information about fair prices and  future trends which are crucial to allocating resources. Goldman was an important part of this picture, and from what I read the Abacus bonds fit pretty well into this model.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When businesses are in a position to exploit people, they are just as happy to do it as any government, or any church.  When a government represents the interests of the people a business or other government seeks to exploit, it&#039;s generally all they have to protect them.

It&#039;s absurd to suggest that businesses become predatory only when a government is involved.  In any group of people enabled to exploit others, some will happily step up.
