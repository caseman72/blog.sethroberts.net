		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the problem I&#039;ve had with the (admittedly inexpensive) noise canceling headphones I&#039;ve had: I leave the switch on and drain the battery. The feature I would like to see is that the headphones automatically switch off the noise canceling after, say, 3 hours. That way if you leave them on and put them away for a few days, you won&#039;t pull them out and find your batteries dead.

The other feature I&#039;d like to see is a very durable cord. I&#039;ve had headphones go bad because a wire in the cord (usually where it goes into the plastic) eventually shorts out. I&#039;d be bummed if that happened to $300 headphones. 

How do QC15&#039;s rate on these points?

Thanks,
David]]></description>
