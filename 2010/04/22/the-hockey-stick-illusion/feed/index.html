		<description><![CDATA[Many comments confuse two separate issues. The Hockey Stick Illusion (and the hockey stick issue in general) is not the same as the question of global warming. The climate might be warming because of GHG emissions, even if the hockey stick is wrong. Discuss, please, one thing at a time. Both Montford and McIntyre have denied been &quot;deniers&quot; or &quot;denialists&quot;. They simply pose technical question, with indefatigable patience and unfailing courtesy and politeness.
Besides, many dismissal&#039;s of Montford&#039;s book (exemplified by several in this thread) are just sweeping assertions (as those of many &quot;deniers&quot;) whereas the book is a very detailed and precise description of a host of technical problems, and of various maneouvres by Mann and others during several years to avoid releasing data, code, and information about how they had proceeded to construct the Hockey Stick chart, and the temperature records and reconstructions on which it is based. The Climategate mails show they were very well aware of the problems, as mentioned (briefly) by Montford and (in more extensive form) by his Bishop Hill blog and McIntire ClimateAudit blog.  One should expect a serious discussion of the specific issues more than sweeping anathemas.]]></description>

I think that there are many recent (or relatively recent) cases where the scientific consensus was wrong.  For example, Portuguese neurologist AntÃ³nio Caetano de Abreu Freire Egas Moniz received the Nobel Prize in 1949.  He pioneered the use of lobotomy as a &quot;treatment&quot; for mental illness.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one really believes that the â€œscience is settledâ€ or that â€œthe debate is over.â€ Scientists and others that say this seem to want to advance a particular agenda. There is nothing more detrimental to public trust than such statements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As for the speed involved, it took McIntyre years to reach his conclusions. A professional couldn&#039;t have done what he did. You can&#039;t take years to reach an unpopular conclusion that makes someone powerful look bad.Â  That&#039;s a career killer.]]></description>

Seth, I don&#039;t *know* you are wrong. I think you are very probably wrong because the scientific consensus is usually right; further, it is unlikely that they would be so far wrong that a non-expert in the field could immediately see through their mistakes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan,  I believe that you are incorrect to state that Mann&#039;s code has never been released, a copy was released as a consequence of the Wegman inquiry and the Senate hearings. The code as released (a spaghetti like mess of Fortran) does not run, and a number of people have struggled to make it work without complete success, so it is unlikely to be the version finally used despite Mann&#039;s claim at the time.

However the code makes at least one item quite clear; as presented the code calculates both the RE and R2 statistics for each step in the reconstruction, thus the authors must have been aware that the reconstruction lacked statistical significance in the early steps contrary to the claims in the paper. The paper even quotes the R2 statistic for a later step (the 1815 step as I recall) where it is supportive, but omits it for the early steps where it is not. That is, prima facie, scientific fraud.

The excuse (as endlessly repeated at propaganda sites like Realclimate) that RE alone is sufficient is obviously false, RE has been known to be inadequate with correlated data since the 1920&#039;s at least, and Mann was well aware of the significantly auto-correlated nature of the residuals from his reconstruction. It is possible that the errors are simply the result of incompetence, but the failure to correct them is dishonest and fraudulent, and it is a great pity that commentors such as Nathan, Hal, and others above cannot recognize and acknowledge such errors and deliberate falsification of the scientific record.]]></description>

&quot;Uhâ€¦ The 30 000 petition Jake is referring is a hoax.&quot;

A hoax? That&#039;s interesting, Pascal, so you have evidence that all 31,000 signatures on the Oregon Petition are fraudulent? Please be more forthcoming, we are dying to hear more.

But of course you don&#039;t, the petition is exactly what it claims to be - nothing more nor less than a large number of people holding scientific degrees who, when asked, signed a statement opposing AGW alarmism. It has never been claimed to prove anything, merely to DISPROVE the phony claim of a scientific &quot;consensus&quot; (whatever that could possibly mean) on this eminently debatable subject.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[wow, some emotional outbursts here when belief systems are challenged! 
Many of the alarmist claims in the latest IPCC report have had to be retracted as based on advocacy, not science. The climate models are not validated and rest on shaky foundations (the key issue is assumptions made regarding feedbacks and climate sensitivity). No empirical evidence exists to support their conclusions. 
The past temperature record is uncertain and some mainstream climate scientists admit it probably needs reworking (the raw data are adjusted by processes which are not divulged and cannot be scientifically checked, Phil Jones of Climategate&#039;s CRU says he has &quot;lost&quot; the original data on which trillion dollar decisions are based). 
The infamous hockey stick, whose story Andrew Mountford so ably describes, is recognized as an artifact of the invalid statistical methods used.
Cap and Trade is being pushed by big banks and politicians, real environmental and social problems are being sidelined.]]></description>

It&#039;s much easier to CALL someone a liar than to prove them so.

Please list the deliberate factual inaccuracies in Andrew Montford&#039;s book (which of course you MUST have read), otherwise your post is nothing but unsubstantiated assertion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoy your blog but I am afraid your methodology for getting at the truth is completely flawed. Your global warming contrarianism is just a symptom of a larger failure. You rely far too heavily on your own personal experiences and discount those of others who disagree with you. Of course this is a nearly universal flaw, but you have made it the very foundation of your intellectual endeavors.

Society benefits from having people like you around, because occasionally you will be right about something and it is good to have advocates for many points of view. But it is to your detriment because you end up believing so many false things. Fortunately being wrong about global warming is not too harmful, unless you intend to bequeath to your descendants a beautiful piece of property that happens to be only six inches above sea level, or some such.]]></description>
