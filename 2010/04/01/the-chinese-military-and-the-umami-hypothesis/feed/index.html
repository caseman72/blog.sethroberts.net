		<description><![CDATA[Something totally off subject. I went to see a movie a couple of months ago. When I walked in there was no one around to take my ticket so I just walked into the theater. After the movie was over I decided that I enjoyed it so much that since I still had my ticket I would leave the theater and come back and watch it again in fifteen minutes. 

When I returned and started watching the movie again it felt like I had seen the movie numerous times. After the movie was over and since then I can remember every single scene from the beginning of the movie to the end. I can&#039;t do this with movies I have seen dozens of times. I only recently realized the amazing recall I have of this movie so I haven&#039;t tried it again to see if it works with another movie or with anything else for that matter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was feeling really, extremely depressed this week because I just moved to a new place. Then, I bought Straus butter at Berkeley Bowl, since I was there.  I instantly felt really happy after I ate the butter!!  That&#039;s great because I have to work tomorrow morning.   I bought it at Berkeley Bowl for about $7.  I will continue it to see its effects.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;One reason I believe my Umami Hypothesis â€” that we require a steady stream of bacteria in our diet to be healthy â€” is the underlying logic: That a steady stream of bacteria continuously activate the immune system, keeping it in working order.&quot;

I&#039;ll never forget the last few words of my professor in the &quot;History of Infectious Diseases&quot; course I took at UC Davis:

&quot;OK guys, so the moral of this story?&quot; He chuckles, &quot;The next time you drop a sandwich on the ground, wait five minutes, then pick it up.&quot;

If you were to ask a few microbiologists, I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;d agree with you.]]></description>
