		<description><![CDATA[Through experience(experimentation) we gain the most valuable knowledge, its better than reading it in a book,or a lecture. interesting that you should blog on this as I blogged about my personal experience and experiments on attaining bliss( as opposed to trying to understand it by reading about it).

		<description><![CDATA[Sometimes self-experimenting is the only way to do it. I&#039;m thinking of Barry Marshall, who has only recently received a Nobel prize for work he did in the 80&#039;s on helicobacter pylori, the bacterium responsible for stomach ulcers. The well entrenched view was that bacteria couldn&#039;t survive in stomach acid, and since no-one would believe otherwise, he drank the stuff and proved them wrong. 

It still took 20 years for the medical establishment to accept this, though, so the Emperor&#039;s New Clothes were much in evidence, too.]]></description>

One of my favorite personal paradoxes is Searching versus Acting: I like to think of my self-experimenting as operationalizing this paradoxical form of inquiry and learning.

		<description><![CDATA[my uncle, a neuroscientist, told me a story recently when i asked him if, within my son&#039;s lifetime, sleep would be obsolete.

he told me about a colleague of his, a sleep researcher.  one day after twenty years or so of study he concluded that there was no reason he could think of that sleep was necessary, and so he decided to cut back on sleep, one minute per day.

he started at 8 hours per day and was fine.  six hours per day -- fine.  four hours per day -- fine.

around the time he reached two hours per day, he was diagnosed with leukemia.]]></description>
