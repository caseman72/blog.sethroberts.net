		<description><![CDATA[Low leves of Omega-3 is possibly the largest health epidemic to hit Western society for years. Resulting in obesity, heart disease, depression, ADHD, behavioural and learning difficulties, restricting brain and CNS development, impairing focus and cognitive function, increasing chance of tumors, cancers, stroke and diabetes. The list is endless. Some sites for further information on the epidemic and the need for Omega-3s: www.nutriska.com, www.omega-3centre.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always thought that omega 3 consumption elevated my mood because it helped me sleep.

But according to this NYtimes blog, maybe I was wrong:

http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/in-sleepless-nights-a-hope-for-treating-depression/

It goes counter to my thinking that regular sleep elevates mood (and I thought the deeper the sleep, through sunlight exposure, omega 3 consumption, exercise, etc..,  the better ).

It is true that when I&#039;m in a bad mood, I tend to not be able to fall asleep.  Maybe it&#039;s my body trying to elevate my mood through sleep deprivation.

Who knows.  One thing is certain.  There&#039;s definitely a strong link between sleep and mood.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;When dinosaurs roamed the earth&quot;, the earth had no ice caps, and the sea level was such that today it would drown more than half the world population&#039;s homes. We don&#039;t want to go there.

Conditions on earth have changed -- you could say evolved -- since then.  Why not look at real evidence being collected in the &lt;i&gt;present&lt;/i&gt;?  There&#039;s lots, and adding it up, it points unambiguously in one direction.
