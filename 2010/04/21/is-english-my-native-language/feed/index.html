		<description><![CDATA[Rewriting can yield useful insights.  I took a run at the paragraph, and in so doing discovered three unclear areas.

(1) The third sentence begins with a &quot;but&quot;, however, that sentence appears to support the previous sentence. The &quot;but&quot; forces the reader to stop and wonder, &quot;what&#039;s she objecting to?&quot;
(2) I was forced to interpret the &quot;temerity&quot; sentence as admiration.  She may have actually meant something else, in which case the sentence would wander into a different thicket.   
(3) The &quot;poignant&quot; word has multiple meanings.  Choose your favorite:
(a) his life and times are more physically painful than they once seemed
(b) his life and times appear more keenly distressing to the mind than they once seemed
(c) his life and times appear more profoundly moving than they once seemed
(d) his life and times appear more incisive than they once seemed
(e) his life and times appear more neat and skillful than they once seemed
(f) his life and times appear more astute and pertinent than they once seemed
(g) his life and times appear more agreeably, intensely stimulating than they once seemed


My version follows.  

&quot;The Publisher&quot; can be dry at times, especially when it explores the thickets of Luce&#039;s &quot;big&quot; ideas.  It works best when it concentrates on the man himself, and especially excels when it assesses Luce&#039;s most important accomplishments, like his &quot;American Century&quot; essay, as well as other efforts to tell Americans what American life was like.  For example, Life magazine devoted a major series in the 1950s to &quot;Man&#039;s New World: How He Lives in It.&quot; Now that the life of an American looks nothing like Henry Luce could imagine, his life and times appear more astute and pertinent than they once seemed.]]></description>

It&#039;s just a book review. She churns them out. She isn&#039;t a professor, who might write three articles per year.

		<description><![CDATA[The best essay I&#039;ve ever read about intellectual posturing is this one, by Richard Dawkins:

http://richarddawkins.net/articleComments,824,Postmodernism-Disrobed,Richard-Dawkins-Nature,page6

Here&#039;s a sample:

===================================

Suppose you are an intellectual impostor with nothing to say, but with strong ambitions to succeed in academic life, collect a coterie of reverent disciples and have students around the world anoint your pages with respectful yellow highlighter. What kind of literary style would you cultivate? Not a lucid one, surely, for clarity would expose your lack of content. The chances are that you would produce something like the following:

    &quot;We can clearly see that there is no bi-univocal correspondence between linear signifying links or archi-writing, depending on the author, and this multireferential, multi-dimensional machinic catalysis. The symmetry of scale, the transversality, the pathic non-discursive character of their expansion: all these dimensions remove us from the logic of the excluded middle and reinforce us in our dismissal of the ontological binarism we criticised previously.&quot;

This is a quotation from the psychoanalyst FÃ©lix Guattari, one of many fashionable French &#039;intellectuals&#039;...

		<description><![CDATA[Some tangential comments about intellectual posturing. John Searle says he asked Michel Foucault why he wrote so badly. Foucault told him that if he wrote as clearly as Searle, no one in Paris would read him or take him seriously. Foucault said that in Paris, at least 10% of what you write must be utterly incomprehensible for you to be taken seriously. 

Later, Searle asked the sociologist Pierre Bordieu if what Foucault said was true. Bordieu said it was more like 20%. 

Noam Chomsky was once asked about dialectical materialism. Chomsky said that he had no idea what it meant; that it had something vaguely to do with recursive processes, he guessed. He said that when something important happens in physics, he can meet with his physicist friends and they will explain it to him and he can grasp it at his own level, with a little bit of work. But with some ideas, especially in social theory, he feels that if he worked for a million years he would never understand it because it&#039;s simply not coherent. 

I&#039;m in a social theory group, with a lot of people who have taught social theory. Much of what we read and some of what is said strikes me as incoherent. But there is a pretense in the field that very abstract generalizations that have the rhetorical flavor of science are revealing some deep truth. I think it&#039;s mostly intellectual fraudulence... 

Psychologists are mostly trying to be scientists, even if they are unclear. Some of the stuff that passes for thought in social theory and the humanities seems like pure bluff...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Nathan - she meant &quot;timidity&quot;.  Other than that error I don&#039;t find the writing that bad and the overall meaning is pretty clear.  I found the use of &quot;parched&quot; instead of &quot;dry,&quot; the term commonly used to refer to uninteresting passages of writing, amusing, but I can see how someone could find it overblown.  I agree with the use of &quot;poignant&quot; in the last sentence.  That is not an overly fancy word.]]></description>

Back on topic, I have to agree with Alex: if you&#039;re interested enough in a topic/presentation, questions will naturally come up. Strong curiosity pushes back against fears of appearing to be the fool.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And speaking of poor writing found in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, check out the first paragraph of this book review (the review was written by one Walter Kirn):

===============================

According to the perverse aesthetics of artistic guilty pleasure, certain books and movies are so bad â€” so crudely conceived, despicably motivated and atrociously executed â€” that theyâ€™re actually rather good. â€œSolar,â€ the new novel by Ian McEwan, is just the opposite: a book so good â€” so ingeniously designed, irreproachably high-minded and skillfully brought off â€” that itâ€™s actually quite bad. Instead of being awful yet absorbing, itâ€™s impeccable yet numbing, achieving the sort of superbly wrought inertia of a Romanesque cathedral. Thereâ€™s so little wrong with it that thereâ€™s nothing particularly right about it, either. Itâ€™s impressive to behold but something of a virtuous pain to read.

		<description><![CDATA[Having been to my share of god-awful boring seminars, I can say that people may not be asking questions because they&#039;re not really paying attention, or they don&#039;t really care.  If the whole talk is pointless, why worry about the Y-axis?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This &quot;insecurity hypothesis&quot; explains what I have observed: Graduate students are less likely to ask questions in a class than a professor who might be sitting in.  In this case, the professor is much more secure in his/her knowledge; the grad students are afraid of looking foolish.  Which flies a bit in the face of your assertion that professors are insecure as well; I&#039;m sure they are but probably not, on average, as insecure in their knowledge as grad students.]]></description>
