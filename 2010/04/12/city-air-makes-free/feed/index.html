		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot; was, rather, a nasty echo of the medieval original.  The original referred to a legal effect: a serf who managed to stay in a city for a year was free of claims by his former landlord. That out was abolished in 1231, for the case of royal cities and princely landlords.  Network effects of city life were rather tertiary to the popularity of the saying.]]></description>
