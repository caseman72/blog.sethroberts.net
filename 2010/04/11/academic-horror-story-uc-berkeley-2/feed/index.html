		<description><![CDATA[LOL!!!

I think it&#039;s an absolute jOkE that people can&#039;t figure out why professor Duesburg looks so damn ignorant in the eyes of so many, even though he&#039;s far from it.
Gallo said himself that &quot;NOBODY KNOWS MORE ABOUT RETROVIRUSES THAN PETER (DUESBERG).&quot; That quickly changed when Duesberg started ripping on Gallo, of course.
Who didn&#039;t see the studies that Duesberg along with so very many others have personally done (BECAUSE I WILL SHOW THEM TO ANYONE WHO MISSED THE BOAT ON THE SUBJECT.) that explain why the professor says what he says, Duesberg&#039;s far from stupid.
I&#039;m a virologist, H.I.V. viruses didn&#039;t come from monkeys either, regardless of the color, green, blue or TuTi-FruitY.
Whats &quot;Idiopathic CD-4 T-Lymphocytepenia&quot; (ICL) What do you think the reason is that Anthony Fauci (NIH) or the NCI hasn&#039;t  mentioned anything regarding Dr. Yamamoto &amp; GcMAF ? Because Yamamoto is correct maybe ?
Who knows what I&#039;m talking about in regards to any of this &amp; that ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Couple of notes.... Johnathon Swift... When Duesberg first started disputing hiv=aids, he was effectively stripped of any credibility, thus rendering his ability to receive research grants gone.  

Hiv testing... it&#039;s NOT reliable.  Tests to not look for HIV.  They look for antibodies that are not specific to anything.  Which is why when children get vaccinated their blood is full of antibodies, they sometimes test positive.  Also, if you get tested and test positive and go back, you can go back even a week later or a day later and test negative.

Antiretrovirals (which still include AZT) have very, very serious side effects.  to prescribe these to a people that have immune systems already comprised doesn&#039;t make any sense.  Secondly, in Africa, all you have to do is be sick and depending where you are, they won&#039; t even test you.  They&#039;ll claim you had HIV that has progressed to AIDS.  btw... AZT was a chemotherapy drug intended for cancer patients in the 70s, but was shelved because of its toxicity.
 I could go on, but if you look for it, the information is out there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The idea that AIDS is a result of vaccines is ludricrous. This is far too easy to prove wrong and is readily apparant when one looks at the HIV testing results. Poor, drug user families are 100X more likely to have an HIV positive child than a middle class family. Yet the vaccination numbers are the exact opposite. 

The evidence is so overwhleming for this, that it&#039;s embarassing to argue or debate. If AIDS was a pharma drug issue, the western world - especially the white middle class and their pill popping obsession - would dominate the AIDS statistics. Yet, there is no AIDS epidemic in suburbia. 

Sadly, the only epidemic is seen in those who somehow come into contact with another person&#039;s blood. Whether through birth, transfusion, sex, needles, or transplants. 

Isn&#039;t it weird how that works. If anyone comes out with some new data, I&#039;m all ears. Until then - all I have is the present research and it sure does look like a blood pathogen (virus) is the cause.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Im no where as smart as all of you guys posting here.

But, I DO have a good sense of who SOUNDS like a conman and who doesn&#039;t.

Why are the &quot;wacko denial guys&quot; posting simple statements and what they consider facts, and the &quot;truthers&quot; go with name calling and character assasinations?

Every single time I read ANY thing from PD or Dr. Fiala, I find them calm and to the point.  Now, this Seth Kalishman or whatever, its an insult a line.

Guess who sounds more believable?

Dr. Duesberg, if you really believe what you are saying, and all this hideous backlash is the OUTCOME of your beliefs, God bless you.  A man who stands by his convictions, regardless the outcome.

Oh, and that Africa thing...............COMMON SENSE tells you its one big con.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Duesberg has proven that HIV does not cause AIDS, and is instead caused by lifestyle, drug consumption, and malnutrition.

I&#039;ve accepted Duesberg&#039;s view.

But that leaves me uncertain as to how to explain why HIV-positive, non-malnourished, non-drug-affected infants develop AIDS.

I&#039;m also saddened that, given that recreational drug use causes AIDS, Duesberg hasn&#039;t done any research into which specific drugs cause AIDS, what dosages are required to produce it, and why the vast majority of recreational drug users never develop AIDS.  In a bizarre coincidence, only those who are HIV-positive do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having a paper withdrawn by Elsevier should be worn like a badge of pride and vindication of truth in this matter.

It was Elsevier who commissioned no fewer than 6 bogus journals in Australia alone that were nothing but advertisements for pharmaceutical companies. Elesevier makes millions on advertisements in its mainstream journals from pharmaceutical companies. To think that the sticky hand of BIG PHARMA is not at work here is simply naive.

One of the main protagonists in the withdrawal of the offending paper was one Seth Kalichman of denyingaids infamy. Seth has stated that a part of his duties at UConn involve the running of his vitriolic blog that regularly slanders Duesberg and Bauer. UConn receive millions in grants from the NIH and BIG PHARMA to pay the salaries of the ilk of Kalichman.

The main complainant to Duesbergs university is Nathan Geffen, who is a member of AIDSTRTUH and the South African Treatment Action Campaign. TAC is funded indirectly by Anglo Gold and various Pharmaceutical Companies. Kalichman regularly quotes and praises Geffen on his blog.

They can scream hysterically all they want, but talk about conflicts of interest? Give me a break these guys are up to their armpits in conflicts of interest, they have all the moral fortitude of crack whores.

Shortly we should see the entry of J Todd Deshong and Poodle Stomper et al posting here with their own version of AIDS Dogma, vomitting back argumentoid comments and generally muddying the waters. The Emails will have already been sent out from AIDSTRUTH HQ rallying the forces to attack.

I too am no expert on the topic of HIV/AIDS but I definately know the smell of RAT. Whether Duesberg is right or wrong, he does not deserve a concerted attack driven by financial greed dressed up as public health concern.

They talk about Denialists, this lot still state AZT did not kill anyone, now that is DENIALISM, and has all the hallmarks of the tobacco companies saying smoking did not cause cancer when they were facing billion dollar damages payouts. And that surely gives the best indicator of their true masters, as none of the lawyers representing the pharmaceutical companies will permit any admission of wrongdoing from anyone on the payroll.

I think Clark Baker has coined the best term for these people, &quot;Pharmasluts&quot;. Apt.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Duesberg was attacked by pharma lobbyists such as M. Essex and his friends. They publicly blamed him for millins of deaths in Africa, which is not only absurd, but unbelievable, because they forget and forget to mention their own, REAL responsibilities for the many AZT victims. (btw, Duesberg warned early and clearly about the AZT problems, but was already ignored)

Now they&#039;ve denied Duesberg to defend himself against their outrageous allegations, by putting pressure on Elsevier.

They&#039;ve also claimed a co-author would have a conflict of interest, which isn&#039;t true, because his employment was years before.... and they again forget to mention their own REAL conflicts of interest, like patents for the medicals that were supposed to be sold in Africa...

Did I miss the point?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If people actually read the withdrawn papers, they might realize that they have been intentionally duped and the HIV/AIDS gang can&#039;t have that. 

I believe that the serious crimes like sexual terrorism, scientific fraud and medical murder that were committed in the name of HIV/AIDS will become common knowledge and as soon as it does, there will be no place to hide for the &quot;public health&quot; officials, &quot;science&quot; editors and journalists who were/are responsible for the fraud or the medical professionals who have mindlessly murdered their patients in the name of science and medical care. It&#039;s no wonder the AIDS mafia strives to silence their critics.

		<description><![CDATA[I am one of the authors of the paper in Medical Hypotheses you are discussing here. In the paper we collected official data from South Africa and Uganda and compared them with previous predictions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am one of the authors of the paper in Medical Hypotheses you are discussing here. In the paper we collected official data from South Africa and Uganda and compared them with previous predictions. Surprisingly, a close examination of the current data (as opposed to public health and media driven beliefs)  showed a dramatically increasing population growth due to constant fertility combined with stable or declining mortality. In summary current public data do not provide the slightest evidence for a deadly (HIV/Aids) epidemic in Africa.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[What?!

I don&#039;t think there is any conflict of interest, just because one of the author&#039;s former employers is a vitamin reseller... I don&#039;t get it.

If you want to call this a conflict of interest, then what do you call Essex, Gallo and all the other AIDS scientists, many of whom literally make millions out of patents and pharma connections... 
That&#039;s what I call a conflict of interest!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, sorry, I&#039;m in a third-world city with terrible internet access (Chicago). As I was writing my comment I lost access. I had coded the Nemeroff case as one where the accused (Nemeroff) had misstated to his university how much drug companies had given him. But, yeah, you could call that a conflict-of-interest problem. That Nemeroff understated those payments by hundreds of thousands of dollars and was investigated only after a US Senator complained and the case received national attention just goes to show how bizarre the charge against Duesberg is. It really is Driving While Black. A black person might get pulled over for going 1 mph over the speed limit. No one else is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I didn&#039;t misquote you.  I quoted a different part of your post than the one you THINK I quoted.  All I did was replace your words &quot;the problem&quot; with &quot;[undeclared conflicts of interest]&quot;.  Here is the full paragraph, part of which I quoted and responded to in my comment:

&quot;Kevin, undeclared conflicts of interest have been a massive problem for American medical schools. Senator Grassley has spent a lot of time on this. As far as I know no professor has ever been investigated by his university for the problem â€” much less the fact that a co-author had the problem.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As far as I can tell, the charge is not about having a paper withdrawn: it&#039;s about the false claims made in the paper that were the reason for the withdrawl.  The wording in the letter is unfortunate, but there&#039;s no need for &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; to be confused by it -- unless, of course, we choose to be confused, or to pretend to be confused.

Does it matter whether anyone had been investigated before, about keeping his co-authors&#039; commercial interests secret?  If it&#039;s part of his responsibility to reveal all conflicts of interest in his submission, then why does it matter whether it&#039;s him or his co-authors who have the conflict?  It would only matter if they had concealed the conflicts from him, and I don&#039;t think anybody suggests that.  By analogy to criminal law, conspiracy to commit a crime is itself a crime.]]></description>
