		<description><![CDATA[Zach, yeah it is incredibly hard if not impossible to quantify this stuff. Mendel, an insider/outsider, discovered genes. There were maybe 100 biology professors at the time whose research was about the same topic. They were the insiders. But how many people were in Mendel&#039;s position, with both scientific knowledge and outsider freedom? That&#039;s really hard to know.

Nathan, no I&#039;m not saying that. If you make enough stuff up, you can come up with a compelling story. The Hockey Stick Illusion contains a vast number of references. Its assertions can be checked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: I&#039;m not getting a clear picture of what importance you are attaching to narrative.  I can understand that a compelling narrative is important, maybe essential, to maintaining reader/viewer/student interest while absorbing complex information.  But you seem to be saying, also, that the presence or absence of a compelling narrative helps to indicate whether the information itself is correct and worthy of attention. Are you saying that incorrect information is inherently difficult to construct a compelling narrative around?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I reread the article you linked to, which was my main source for the complaint. On second reading, I see that I misinterpreted a couple of passages. However, I still think it would instead be correct to assert that he failed to profile the folks at Goldman in greater depth because they are insiders, and therefore denied him access. As we are seeing more and more, many of these people did have a sense of what was to come and chose to profit (much like the outsiders). However, because they are complicit, they have an incentive to cover up, whereas the outsiders had no reason not to scream bloody murder. I suppose this expedited the exposure of their wrong doing, which plays further into your portrayal of evens. Thanks for pushing me to re-examine this post. I hope sometime in the future you will explore further the notion of insider-outsider, above just pointing it out where it appears. For me the notion still has the unsettling air of the anecdotal, though we see it praised quite a bit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Zach, that&#039;s a good point (&quot;isn&#039;t it a little...&quot;) if I&#039;d seen the comment you mention. But I haven&#039;t. Where did you see it? I heard Lewis say he thinks his main characters were able to see the coming collapse because they were outsiders. Just what I&#039;m saying. See this:

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t it a little disingenuous to talk about this as confirmation of the importance of insider/outsiders when Michael Lewis has explicitly mentioned that he chose the people profiled in large part for their outsider status? You refer to them as his heroes, and that is precisely because they fit an appealing narrative. At the same time, more and more insiders (or at least a certain contingent thereof) are being exposed as having prior knowledge of the coming collapse and exploiting it. Are you saying that the difference lies in their response to that recognition?]]></description>
