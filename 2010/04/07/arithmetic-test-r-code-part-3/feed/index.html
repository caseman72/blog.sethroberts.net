		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Thanks for posting thigs. I have most of this working in R, but I get the error message could not find function &quot;newmath2.problem&quot;.

It seems like there should be functions defined for newmath2.problem() and newmath2.feedback().  If so, could you post them?

Thanks,]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, the crucial function runs on Windows but not other operating systems. So at the most basic level you are okay. However, to solve problems that come up I think you will need a basic knowledge of R. And the data analysis requires a bunch of data (e.g., 100 trials) to work properly. In other words: this will be difficult for a non-R user to use. You will need to have basic R proficiency AND study the code carefully  to get things to work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I plan on installing R and playing with this stuff in about two weeks (I won&#039;t have time until then).  I&#039;m fairly tech-savvy, but is there anything else that is non-obvious that I will need to know in order to avoid potential headaches and cursing when I go to implement this stuff?  I have a Windows XP machine.

Thanks for posting the code.]]></description>
