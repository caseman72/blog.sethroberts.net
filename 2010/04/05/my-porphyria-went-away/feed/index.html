Thanks for linking that story. That made my morning! Especially the WTF1 gene responsible for the supra-credulous, LOL!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Usually when the dishwasher doesn&#039;t work, you just need to clean out the trap.  

We don&#039;t get an owner&#039;s manual for our own bodies.  At issue, anyway, is often to a large degree that they can&#039;t patent your typical &quot;owner&#039;s manual&quot; solution.  They certainly don&#039;t get a Nobel for it.  (Barry Marshall and Robin Warren did, but they couldn&#039;t patent it either.)

This story seems apropos: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/04/01/scientists-discover-gene-and-part-of-brain-that-make-people-gullible/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments, Aaron. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a mistake to think of the body as a machine -- but let&#039;s read the owner&#039;s manual.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for featuring my experience on your blog. One small quibble, however. I wouldn&#039;t say that the &quot;fixing the gene&quot; approach is necessarily wrong. Rather, I think it is often a much less viable, and much more expensive option than fixing the environmental cause (e.g., removing wheat gluten and omega-6 laden vegetable oils from my diet in my case). This environmental-change approach did not, however, clear up my red-green colorblindness. A group of researchers that recently created a red-green colorblind squirrel monkey were subsequently able to correct the deficit with gene therapy and return the afflicted individuals to full trichromatic vision (http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/09/colortherapy/). My point is that all of our phenotypic effects reflect the interactions of genetic and environmental factors. In some cases, the environmental contribution is easy to manipulate to fix the problem, but in other cases it may be necessary to intervene at the genetic level (if possible). But your point is very well taken that the overemphasis on modern, highly technical approaches used in modern medicine, stemming from the dominant body-is-machine metaphor, blinds medical science and the lay public (and government and funding agencies) to the body-as-natural-system framework that we are advocating with our Ancestral Health Symposium and Ancestral Health Society. Parkour!]]></description>
