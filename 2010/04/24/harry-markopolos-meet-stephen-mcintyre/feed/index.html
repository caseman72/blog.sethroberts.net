		<description><![CDATA[I have cousins who would have been Madoff victims.  I asked, and was told they avoided him because the word had gone around to stay clear.  The untold story of Madoff is likely to involve pervasive bribes, kickbacks, and cooked audits.  Normally a guy like Madoff never gets to jail, because he&#039;s too valuable as a stoolie.  In this case, evidently, nobody was interested in who he could finger.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vic - I with you on this...but I&#039;d like you to consider your use of the word hoax in a slightly different context.  To me, both the economic modelers and the AGW modelers perhaps weren&#039;t attempting a deliberate fraud as much as simply falling in love with their ideas; falling in love with their Frankenstein creations; all of it a  fantasy built on a firm bedrock of unquestioned assumptions and false beliefs and a willful ignorance of and contempt for real-world measurement.

That Madoff was perpetrating a fraud is clear and he&#039;s in prison  - is the intent of the AGW crowd to perpetrate a similar fraud?  Maybe not...But the objective result ends up equally harmful if not more so (COP15 alone had 45,000 of the world best talkers talking about and agreeing on nothing  - that couldn&#039;t have cost much...hmm....so much for good intent).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting parallel - but the claim of &quot;thousands of scientists at hundreds of universities&quot; is a bit disingenuous.  The overwhelming majority of those thousands have not the time, interest or expertise to evaluate the claims of climate scientists on their own.  Most would not dream of lying about their science and do not expect to be lied to.  Much like the father-in-law of Casey&#039;s insurance executive, they take the word of people they believe can be trusted. When that word also supports other elements in a person&#039;s world view (man is greedy, corporations crush human freedom, capitalism serves the interests of elites) that word is more readily accepted. The conspiracy of thousands is simply a straw-man. 

Vic&#039;s complaint above deserves a far more nuanced response than I can supply here. I&#039;d just like to make a few points:

1. Science is nothing more than the systematic and careful observation of events in the real world followed by the development of explanations (theories) for their occurence.
2. All theories are models. Mathematical/computer models are simply dynamic extensions of those models to generate predictions of future events (i.e. if what we know is true, and all other things remain equal, changing this should result in that...)
3. Theories will always be used to justify a course of action. Any theory can be used to justify diametrically opposed courses of action.  Economic Theory does not mandate bloated executive compensation, but bloatedly compensated executives will use theory as their justification.
4. Science is not TRUTH. It is a way of &quot;knowing&quot;.... but there are other ways of &quot;knowing&quot;,  much like the words from a duet in &quot;The Woman In White&quot;: &quot;....I believe my heart. It believes in you. It&#039;s telling me that what I see is completely true...&quot;
5. You don&#039;t submit your emotional life to scientific scrutiny, you don&#039;t base public policy on the yearnings of your heart.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This bears on society&#039;s &quot;clean hands&quot; preference for abstract, disembodied theory rather than any resort to grubby fact-checking of &quot;reality&quot;, if you will.  Empirical  scientific method stands wholly opposed to such elitist privilege, which partially explains why mere verbalizers gravitate to model-making disciplines such as &quot;climatology&quot; (sic),  economics, even law.

For some decades now, deconstructionists and feminists in particular have explicitly rejected reliance on objective, rational argument in favor of contentious attitudinal assertions lacking any basis in socio-cultural reality  whatever.  So long as this unreasoning prejudice against hands-on,   non-ideological integrity persists, so long will polities remain in thrall to incompetent, corrupt insiders of all persuasions.

Perhaps the worst offenders are those high achievers, men of wealth, who gravitate to politics with the object of suppressing free markets not only in competitive products but ideas.  Delusions of grandeur foster the endemic societal disease which celebrates such as Bernie Madoff until all is lost.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I am more than willing to believe that global warming mightl be a hoax, but a far bigger hoax is the entire academic discipline of economics (as related by Nassim Taleb among others).  To a greater degree than climate science, economic &quot;science&quot; rely on mathematical models to model that which cannot be modeled.  And the economic hoax is costing us far more than any possible climate hoax, as bogus, but scientific sounding,  economic theories underlie everything from fiscal and monetary policy to individual and pension plan investment decisions, from the structure of markets and financial instruments, to policies on immigration, free trade, taxation, and welfare and to social norms about executive compensation, etc. etc.]]></description>
