		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Their very livelihoods depend on adhering to the consensus and keeping the money flowing&quot;

That is true in any scientific discipline. In almost any sense, being in the mainstream science is incentived, but that does not mean mainstream science is necessary wrong (in fact, it is mainstream science because it reached some threshold where an important part of the community of experts thought there was strong evidence to support it). To judge a theory just look the peer reviewed literature... Yes, I know your next comment will be about peer review process. So to save a few words from you, everybody knows it is far from perfect. Maybe 50 per cent papers are wrong, but one thing you can be sure of is that outside the peer-review literature the wrong claims are 100-epsilon percent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dennis Mangan: Do you have any idea what an &lt;i&gt;order of magnitude&lt;/i&gt; is?  Do you think a million and a trillion are about the same, more or less?

Climate scientists get paid the same whether species go extinct &lt;i&gt;en masse&lt;/i&gt; or not -- until civilization collapses from loss of whole ecosystems, famine, and consequent global war.  They, like I, and like anybody not entirely blinkered, have an interest in that not happening.  The cockroaches will survive regardless.  Some humans, too,probably, but certainly not you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, you mention Exxon and &quot;its just profits&quot;, and most AGW believers often mention Big Oil and the money it throws around. Yet climate scientists and hangers on get millions, maybe billions if you count NGOs, in grants etc. Their very livelihoods depend on adhering to the consensus and keeping the money flowing. And there wouldn&#039;t be any money for saying everything&#039;s normal, go home and take a nap.

Not evidence of anything, but it calls their objectivity into question. 

&quot;It&#039;s difficult for a man to believe something when his livelihood depends on him not believing it.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, can you think of any sort of evidence that could possibly change your mind about this global conspiracy of unscrupulous climate scientists, bent on depriving Exxon of its just profits?  Or does every conceivable bit of evidence lead you to the same conclusion?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;One of the best science books in years&quot;.

I love this. There is 36 reviews on Amazon and all of then give five stars. What is the probability of that?. Just look at a very popular book http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270498753&amp;sr=8-1
and make your own statistical analysis.

I guess that is probably saying something more interesting about the book than any review. :-)]]></description>
