		<description><![CDATA[@Sam,

I think you&#039;re misapplying that idea. The point of the graph is to clearly show the changes occurring. 

At the very least, using 0 lbs as a base line would be odd - no one is going to go to 0 lbs. Maybe 175 lbs or something (or whatever the desired weight is for the person).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good job! Your ability to get results puts you in a rare class.

However, I feel that your data is undercut by the quality of the graph you use. The lowest point your graph can represent is 210; it&#039;s impossible to represent zero. For anyone familiar with graphs, it seems like you are adjusting your scale to dramatize the change. 

This wouldn&#039;t be fair to you, and I&#039;m sure you didn&#039;t intend it. It&#039;s a problem common enough for Edward Tufte to discuss it. Here&#039;s a brief explanation:

You also see this whenever financial news programs swoosh a new chart onto the screen; it drives me crazy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe Seth is quoting someone else&#039;s success on the diet.

I joined Weight Watchers a few years ago and lost 10-15 pounds the first two months, eventually taking off 45 pounds or so. Kept it off too for a couple years. I&#039;m not sure many Shangri-La-ers have such good results. But my case was exceptional for WW.

I had tried Shangri-La the year before (even bought the book) but it didn&#039;t do much for me, and I felt nauseous drinking the oil. Personally I suspect that&#039;s how it works, for the people it works for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wait a minute, I thought you were the Shangri-La guy.  Didn&#039;t you develop and have great success with the Shangri-La diet several years ago?  Didn&#039;t I read somewhere you attained your ideal weight, but still took a maintenance dose of flaxseed oil?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[me: three and a half months, down 13 pounds or so.

i don&#039;t have a snazzy graph like the above, but it would look similar albeit with a less pronounced slope.  

people are starting to ask questions.  is there a good starting point online where i can send people for information?]]></description>
