		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Seth on this.

@ Ed M.

This stuff is a self-fulfilling prophecy. As long as tech is manufactured in a way that makes it hard to tinker, it /will/ be hard to tinker. If we create a demand for openness, we may nudge things the other way. I&#039;d like to think most people aspire to be more than /just/ consumers.

@ Jake

You say &quot;there are very few limitations on the creative energies of software designers&quot; and you are right - but your argument falls here because one of those limitations is the control Apple impose on iPad apps. Cory Doctrow&#039;s peice was as much about that as the hardware.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cory Doctorow has a quaintly old fashioned view of computers and it is a hacker&#039;s view. Computers are a tool. Who cares how it was put together as long as it works and is fast. All the innovation, all the excitement is in the software. And there are very few limitations on the creative energies of software designers.

I don&#039;t have an Ipad but all reports are that this tool works and is fast.  That&#039;s all I care about. I am waiting for genius developers to create apps that will better my life in new and unique ways.   

Cory Doctorow will ignore all the magical apps to come because he will be too busy trying to pry open the Ipad case with a pocket knife.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting point, but most people don&#039;t want to open up their gadgets and tinker... 

The Open Source ethos is great at an individual level, you get freedom, but you pay for it in time and frustration.  A friend of mine spent over 40 hours making a MythTV box as a replacement for his Tivo.  Sure his customized box has more capabilities, and he saved a couple bucks, but his wife can&#039;t figure out how to use it... 

Typical Consumers want an experience, not a hobby. 

The Apple platform, while it may cater to incumbents, provides a platform for all comers.
