		<description><![CDATA[The question that comes up for me is, sure, vegans get healthier when they chuck the standard (rotten) diet for a cleaner, non-processed diet. How much of that is merely the recovery from years of eating crap -- and what happens to long-term vegans?  It seems to me -- from those I know and those whose blogs or experiences I read on the web -- very many of them get better for a while, and then, as their body continues to get insufficient nutrition, they get sicker, or weaker, or reproductively damaged, or more and more allergic to more and more of the few things they WILL eat.  Sure, some vegans do just fine -- but is it most?  (And how many of those &quot;vegans&quot; who do fine turn out to be eating some meat some of the time?)  hard to count, hard to tell.  But it seems less than optimal to ignore the human *animal* in nutrition decisions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Alex and @Seth,

One more reason why going vegan might result in at least short-term improvements in health is by getting away from animal products from factory-raised animals. These have a very different fatty-acid profile than their ancestral brethren that our hunter-gatherer ancestors hunted and fished for. The omega 6:omega 3 ratio is very skewed in factory meat, closer to 15:1 than in wild animals and pastured animals (e.g., grass fed cattle, chickens, etc.) which have ratios in the realm of 1:1 to 3:1 O6:O3. The imbalanced ratio found in factory farmed animals is a likely contributor to chronic systemic inflammation, which seems to be a source of many of the diseases of civilization, in particular metabolic disorders and cancer. The hormones factory farmed animals are pumped with are also likely contributing to modern health woes. Like humans, cows were not meant to consume the seed grains from annual grasses (wheat, corn, etc.). The evidence is incredibly strong for just how damaging this is to both humans and our farm animals, especially when the grains are not properly treated (see http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2010/05/traditional-preparation-methods-improve.html). Unfortunately, grains do not come with a &quot;handle with care!&quot; warning label, and it took humans millennia to figure this out. We seemed to have lost our ancestral wisdom over the last few hundred years, however.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, your story about vegans doesn&#039;t strike me as contradictory as it might strike you, for three reasons:

1. I don&#039;t see meat protein as special. Beyond being good for building muscle, I don&#039;t think it has special benefits. It&#039;s animal fat that makes a huge &amp; surprising difference. Your vegans probably went from one diet low in animal fat to another.

2. I&#039;m sure vegetables are healthy. I believe we like sweetness so that we would eat more vegetables -- vegetables have far more sugar than meat does. Changing from a diet of meat &amp; potatoes (and few vegetables) to all vegetable could be an improvement. At least you would be getting a decent amount of vegetables.

3. As Anthony says, any big change of diet (e.g., from high meat to meatless) will involve dozens of changes at the micro- and macro-nutrient level. As far as I can tell, the average American diet is so terrible that randomly picking another diet could easily be an improvement -- I&#039;d say the odds are about 50%. Even better (regression to the mean) if you have a health problem caused by diet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Stephen.

I agree with @Anthony.

@Alex: The goal isn&#039;t to share impassioned testimonials; the goal is to share experiences and all the unexpected turns that those experiences take. We are all limited to some extent by our own experience, so we can look at other people&#039;s experiences as sources of conjectures to test on our own bodies. I never set out to cure myself; I just assessed the logic of some other people&#039;s self-experiments and ideas on health and then decided to test them on myself. I did not falsify these conjectures (and I experienced positive benefits), so I kept tinkering with them.

My n=1 may be helpful to others who can relate to my tale. However, the problem of induction and biochemical individuality make it such that your own personal experience trumps everything else. See my recent essays: 

&quot;Black Swan Logic for n=1 Health&quot;:

http://epistemocrat.blogspot.com/2010/02/black-swan-logic-for-n1-health.html

&amp;

&quot;Self-Experimentation with Meta-Rules: Quality of Knowledge &amp; Overcoming the Justificationist Addiction&quot;:

http://epistemocrat.blogspot.com/2010/04/self-experimentation-with-meta-rules.html

Meta-Rules say nothing about whether or not you should eat meat; they say, &quot;Listen to your body, then iterate.&quot;

I like to say, &quot;Self-experimentation rises to the surface as the most effective modus operandi in the face of nutritional opacity.&quot;

That&#039;s German for: Test things on your body and just see what happens.

But, when it comes to testing potentially dangerous things, I also like to say, &quot;Outsource your body to Aaron Blaisdell and let him be your lab rat for a few days. It&#039;s safer to live vicariously anyways.&quot; lol

Cheers!

		<description><![CDATA[@Alex,

Aye, there&#039;s the rub.

My guess is:

1. Often when people change their diets, they change a whole slew of things (including extra-diet factors).

2. Different people probably respond to food differently. This is most obvious with things like lactose intolerance, or people who metabolize alcohol differently, or gluten allergies. My guess is it&#039;s also true for other things. 

If 2. is right, then self-experimentation becomes more important, as typical studies will bring up (surprise) conflicting results.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post.  That&#039;s a nice summary showing what didn&#039;t work and what worked.  Also found it interesting that you&#039;ve gained all that muscle mass without gaining inches in your waist.  I agree that physicians need to work with their patients and patients should be more doubtful, think critically and don&#039;t follow the blind faith of their physician...just because &quot;they&#039;re the doctor&quot;.  

Regarding Nathan&#039;s post...that reminds me of an article showing that diabetes can be &quot;cured&quot; with bariatric surgery.  They don&#039;t know the mechanism but it seems to cure it instantaneously, before a change in diet can take effect.  http://www.parade.com/health/2010/05/can-this-surgery-cure-diabetes.html]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A bit off-topic, I keep hearing about people&#039;s migraines cured with heart surgery to close septal defects.  Apparently heart surgeons are doing this procedure in great numbers, without benefit of studies that demonstrate their effectiveness, and some doctors are decrying surgeons&#039; opportunism for preying on patients&#039; desperation.  I don&#039;t know how the patients are paying for such unrecognized treatment, but insurance coverage seems unlikely. Could it be that migraine pain motivates seeking effective treatment?

I know someone who had heart surgery for some other reason, and her migraines did vanish.  It seems like just the sort of side effect that would be noticed and commented on (although experience suggests it would take a very long time for anyone to write about it).  Similarly, the heart surgeon who noticed that most of his patients, but not colleagues, had a crease in their ear lobes, which did turn out to be strongly correlated with blocked arteries.

I wonder if surgeons can be persuaded to perform work to improve cranial venal flow in MS patients, despite the lack of studies demonstrating its effectiveness.]]></description>
