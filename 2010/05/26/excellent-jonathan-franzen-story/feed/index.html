		<description><![CDATA[In my first year of uni we had a bunch of fellow computer science students steal programs from other students and pass them off as their own. The action taken over this blatant theft? An extension of four days was given (on an original 7-day project) for the thieves to resubmit their own work.

No punishment, no consequences.

End of the year and most of the thieves drop out of university entirely. This article makes me wonder if they had been plagiarising their way through high-school, consequence free, until it finally catches up with them where it means a hell of a lot.

Are kids who are punished strongly but fairly when they are young less likely to commit bigger crimes when they get older?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The whole notion of date-rape prosecution bothers me.  I don&#039;t condone rape, but how can you build a case on one person&#039;s word? I know guys (or I should say, I believe their side of the story) who have had their lives upended by false accusations of rape.  We also have the prominent example of the Duke Lacrosse case.  

On Adam Wheeler, I don&#039;t particularly condone what he did either, but you could also view it as acting out against an unfair system that rewards all sorts of unworthy people on the basis of arbitrary or shallow criteria, like accomplishment in sports or &quot;leadership&quot; in the case of a Rhodes or affirmative action (i.e., racisms) in the case of admission to Harvard.  I&#039;m always astounded when people have such a black/white view of morality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Over a good many years, I have run across a number of women who had been &quot;interfered with&quot; (as the saying used to be) by neighbors, family friends, more distant relatives. In about 90% of the cases, parents, especially mothers, made it clear that family unity or social hierarchy meant that either the girl was blamed, or at least it was hushed up and the complaint ignored. 

This is a subset of the defining moment, particularly for females and particularly in more traditional &amp; authoritarian societies (and I think Franzen is picking up on tribalism in the Progressive environment), when the child realizes that the don&#039;t-make-waves business-as-usual of the collective trumps individual happiness and welfare in the eyes of the parents. So frequent it is difficult to consider it cowardice. Likewise in business. Exceptional heroic myths to the contrary.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I worked at a Fortune 50 firm for 25 years and saw many cases of managers failing to address problem employees.  Sometimes it was due to conflict aversion; many people just don&#039;t like to get in the midst of conflicts, and improving (or firing) an incompetent employee is definitely full of conflict.  It didn&#039;t help that the rules and regulations about firing, which probably came from a few justified lawsuits, made it near impossible to remove someone for just incompetence.  My father saw the same thing in the firm he worked for.  Eventually, though, bad economic times came, and management ordered a percentage of employees to be dropped, and these people were fired during a recession.  These people were mistreated two times; they had &#039;jobs&#039; without producing real work or real results for too many years, and then were dumped into a poor job market without real skills.  And the shareholders were ripped off all those years because these people not only didn&#039;t work, they were negative producers; they caused other people to cover for them.  Productivity went up after the cullings.

In summary, it&#039;s not just academia.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adam Wheeler &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be ridiculed for the rest of his life, but he probably won&#039;t be.  Jayson Blair (disgraced former &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; reporter), Stephen Glass (disgraced former &lt;i&gt;New Republic&lt;/i&gt; reporter), Elliot Spitzer (&quot;Client #9&#039;&quot;), and James Frey (author of &lt;i&gt;A Million Little Pieces&lt;/i&gt;) all made come-backs to one extent or another.  One wonders what you actually have to do in order to disappear from the public sphere altogether.]]></description>
