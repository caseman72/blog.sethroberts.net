		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Mimicry is the foundation of Ancestry:

http://ancestryfoundation.org/Foundation_Home.html

&quot;Ancestry is a human development foundation that respects human beings&#039; innate capacity to learn and grow via mimicry.&quot;

It sounds like Benyus attended Ancestry.

I learned how to write by mimicry too.

I mimic folks like Nassim and you.

&quot;Myth as mentor,&quot; I say.

Cheers,

Brent]]></description>
