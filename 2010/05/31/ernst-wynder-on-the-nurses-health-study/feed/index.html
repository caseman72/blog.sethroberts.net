		<description><![CDATA[The basic statistic is...

Japanese are a nation of heavy smokers and yet have very low rates of lung and heart disease.

Japanese also consume more seaweed than most.

so...

smoking + no lung cancer + seaweed = Japanese

smoking + lots of lung cancer + no seaweed = American]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Japan has Marlboro and Camel. They&#039;re all cigarettes. 

Given that seaweed is known to get rid of &quot;hard to get rid of&quot; toxins as well as nourish the lungs and throat (anything soft and slimy in the body), I&#039;d say it&#039;s a safe bet that part of the Japanese connection involves mass amounts of seaweeds.

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry Wilhelm, but you&#039;re stretching when you say that &quot;the negative effect of cows-milk is proven to be very strong.&quot;  The negative effects of isolated casein have been proven to be strong but that doesn&#039;t tell us anything about milk itself.  Whey, present in real milk but absent from the casein damning studies, has been shown to offer a preotective effect against cancer.

On an observational level, where is the large amounts of cancer that we should be seeing amongst that Massai and other traditional dairy based cultures?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the US, about 90% of people with lung cancer are smokers or former smokers, but of all smokers, only about 10% get lung cancer. Assuming most smokers eat and are exposed to more or less the same things, this suggests that those who get lung cancer have a genetic predisposition to it. That might or might not somehow be triggered by one or more dietary factors, one or more environmental factors, something else entirely, or some combination of factors. Interestingly, the monoclonal antibody drug bevacizumab (Avastin), which treats cancer by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor, is significantly more effective in people of Asian descent. It&#039;s possible that Japanese smokers have a genetic difference that makes them less susceptible to lung cancer. Cancer is extremely complex and highly variable and to think that single element can be responsible for causing or preventing it is simplistic. For example, mesothelioma is associated with asbestos exposure. However, most people who have extensive asbestos exposure from say a lifetime working in a shipyard never get this disease, and of those who do get it, probably less than half have any traceable asbestos exposure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert Reis, thanks, very interesting article about problems in the case against smoking. Wynder had experimental evidence (from mice) that cigarettes were carcinogenic -- evidence not mentioned in that essay. And all that rating of evidence (&quot;second-rate&quot;) is misleading because the &quot;second-rate&quot; evidence is dismissed rather than examined to see what you can learn from it. I think the answer to the mysteries and paradoxes the article describes is that smoking does have beneficial effects. It&#039;s another example of hormesis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Nurses&#039; Health Study was discussed extensively by Taubes in Good Calories Bad Calories. IIRC it came out with the &quot;wrong&quot; answer. Dietary fat was not showing up as linked to heart disease. That lead to ideas like &quot;we live in a toxic environment.&quot; That became a justification for ignoring previous study results and promotion of forms of study that could only confound results. The Seven Countries study which ultimately became the foundation for the belief that dietary fat is bad was the result of this kind of thinking.

If it is indeed true that smoking is not linked to lung cancer, (using the Taubes &quot;bad scientist, bad result&quot; hypothesis) my head is going to hurt. I&#039;ve got a lot of anecdotal evidence in my head that says smoking -&gt; cancer... Although I wonder about dose and other forms of tobacco...
