		<description><![CDATA[[...] Seth Roberts in talking about the Foxconn suicides has a critique of academia:  It would be incredibly helpful to figure out whatâ€™s causing them. But few professors want to study a problem that they have no idea if they can solve nor how long it will take. They donâ€™t want to wait ten years to write a paper. By then their funding will have run out. If funding is assured regardless of progress, then how does the funder ensure they are actually doing something? And few professors have total academic freedom. Their graduate school advisor, their academic friends, the people who control their career have certain beliefs. About which theories are good and which are bad. About which methods are â€œcorrectâ€. If their results contradict these beliefs, if they use a â€œwrongâ€ method, they will suffer, just as all heretics suffer. So there is pressure to come up with an acceptable answer using proper methods. This gets in the way of coming up with the actual answer. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is not a problem. 12 out of 330,000 in 5 months. See the Wikipedia page on national suicide rates. Do the math.

Half of these are probably copycat suicides which will fade out when the publicity dies.

One thing Foxconn could do is not pay 6-10 years of &quot;suicide compensation&quot; to families. Foxconn has no obligation to them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth
I&#039;m on my final year, hopefully, of my phd. I learned the hard way why you don&#039;t take on a problem like the one you describe. I hate to say it, but it&#039;s really hurt my career. I love to take chances and try to push science in new directions but you can&#039;t as a student or even as an academic unless you have such a reputation and huge research program that it won&#039;t cripple you.
I&#039;m really down on science right now as a result of these sorts of issues]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vic, my guess is that the owner of Foxconn feels embarrassed by what has happened. Due to the publicity of course. Whether journalists think it is higher status to cover Foxconn than a coal mine I don&#039;t know. Manufacturing is a much larger business in China than mining, so in some sense manufacturing is a bigger story.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Considering that thousands of Chinese coal miners die each year and that tens, if not hundreds, of millions of Chinese have their lives shortened by lack of safety and environmental regulations, 13 suicides among a population of 300,000 of mostly young males suggests that preventing suicide is more high-status than preventing other forms of morbidity and mortality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read about the incidents.  A lot of people of the far east are frustrated by the entire economic model.  Indeed, they produce the entire product but make little money compared to Apple, Microsoft, Dell, etc...  Marketing and design is where the vast majority of the profit is made.  

Still, that doesn&#039;t really explain the higher suicide rate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, this story is getting coverage here in Korea.  I hope that there are changes that can be made.  Awareness of the problem and not trying to cover up the issue may be a good start.

Note, the US military faced similar concerns with suicides by members returning from the early deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.  A program designed to raise awareness of the issue was the response...not sure of its effectiveness.  Also, there was/is a concern that the suicide rate may be higher than reported, as some may be reported as motorcycle and auto accidents.

Q: Is there a higher than expected accidental death rate at Foxconn?]]></description>
