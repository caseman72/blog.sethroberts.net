		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting, never thought of a stick of butter as biscotti before!  My question is how would you, and other non-traditional lifestyle people educate and gain acceptance from the &quot;mainstream&quot; audience.  I am imagining Brent working out at the gym, then pulling out a stick of butter, instead of sugar filled power bars or gatorade.  That won&#039;t fly with even &quot;health conscious&quot; workout nazis.  Yes, health conscious is a relative term, as many of them follow conventional beliefs when it comes to dieting.  

How do you make it stick with people?

Also, I&#039;m partial to the idea of MetaRules.  Sounds like there are a lot of &quot;don&#039;ts&quot; and absolutes and it sounds discouraging to me.  Probably a necessity and some are humorous, but still not very positive sounding.  

I tried my own n=2...2 because my girlfriend and I both experimented with a 90/10 mix of protein/veggies/fruits to 10% carbs and in about 4 weeks, we both lost a combined 8 lbs...  A positive side effect was that I ate more variety of veggies and meat, and more often because we wern&#039;t filled up with &quot;empty&quot; carbs, like all the refined grains we were eating before.  So instead of a side of carbs, we would replace that with more greens and a larger portion of meat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[*Thanks to my friend, Will Eberhardt: He tipped me to cultured butter (and FAGE Greek yogurt and lots of other great nutrition things). And he&#039;s a vegetarian golfer (among other things). 

Nutrition is the ultimate non-expert expertise: we are all engaging in its science and discovery each and every day.

Also, my ancestor, Dr. Francis. M. Pottenger, Jr. (see Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation), did fascinating research on the beneficial effects of animal fats and saturated lipids on skin and hair (epithelial tissue generally) health. Good hyperlipidity is a protective against skin cancer, for instance, most likely.]]></description>
