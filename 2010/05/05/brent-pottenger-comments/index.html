				<p>I asked Brent if he had any comments on <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/05/03/brent-pottenger-and-the-benefits-of-an-ancestral-diet/">his experience</a> (after he adopted an ancestral diet, his migraines and sinus infections stopped). He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The quality of my life (mental + physical health) improved even further  when I started eating slices of butter throughout the day awhile back.  For awhile, I was using spoonfuls of coconut butter/coconut oil and/or  Greek yogurt for this satiation role, but once I added butter slices to  the mix, I beefed up my nutritional &#8216;bag of tricks&#8217; quite a bit. Of  course, I had cooked in butter for a few years, but I never made the  link to simply eat it in slices, despite enjoying its taste so much.  And, a little bit goes a long way. I eat cultured butter from a few  different brands and a few different locations of the world (hoping this  diversification may carry extra beneficial side-effects: different  strains of micro-organisms, etc.). I try to find brands that are  pastured too (more naturally-occurring Omega-3&#8242;s, evidently). I usually  suck on/chew on the butter slowly because I&#8217;ve found this has improved  my oral health too: animal lipids (plus coconut oil) are good for epithelial tissue health  (that&#8217;s why I rub coconut oil on my face and skin and rub butter,  coconut oil, and yogurt on my hands). Pairing butter and coffee (I eat  the butter; I don&#8217;t put it in my coffee; I drink my coffee black) has  become a nice start to my day (Dave Lull even found a study speculating  on the benefits of coupling hyperlipidity and anti-oxidants together in  this way; I think it&#8217;s also a useful approach to detoxifying the liver),  particularly when I know I am going to workout that morning&#8211;this  little hyperlipidity kick seems to help in the gym too (when I am not  fasting). Using butter slices in this manner is a nice compliment to  fasting intermittently&#8211;these two practices allow me to enjoy  low-caloric intake periods pleasantly. They set up my &#8220;feasts&#8221; nicely.  Whenever I have a &#8220;grumbling&#8221; stomach, or I feel a &#8220;biting&#8221; sensation in  my stomach, I eat a small piece of butter, and my mood and body tend to  stabilize. And, like bacon and yogurt and eggs, it&#8217;s cheap. Butter has  certainly been an excellent &#8216;cheap health option&#8217; for me.</p></blockquote>
<p>He later added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now I am working intently on Meta-Rules. Meta-Rules  are simply &#8216;rules for making rules&#8217; to live by. Three dynamics concern me deeply: (1) The problem of induction; (2) biochemical individuality; and, (3) factoring for the unseen. For instance, one of my nutritional Meta-Rules is: &#8220;Don&#8217;t consume anything that causes a negative physiological reaction.&#8221; From this Meta-Rule, I have deduced the following rule to live by (as one example): &#8220;Don&#8217;t consume high-fructose corn syrup.&#8221; A marker for monitoring this rule could be facial inflammation and &#8216;puffiness&#8217; post-consumption, as one possibility. That&#8217;s an example of a higher-level precept empowering an individual to deduce for him or herself how that concept applies (or does not apply) in his/her own specific case (I like the term: Patient of One). Over time, I suspect that something like William Baines&#8217; Biomedical Mutual Organization (BMO) could emerge if enough people were self-experimenting with Meta-Rules  and interacting about their experiences and results. Amongst this cohort of parallel n=1 clinical trials, some convergence of Meta-Rules may occur, indicating ways that our bodies are the same, and also showing how our bodies differ individually when it comes to things like diet, exercise, and lifestyle design.</p></blockquote>
<p>To explain why headaches can be due to inflammation, he pointed me to <a href="http://coolinginflammation.blogspot.com/2009/10/migraine-headache-diet.html">this</a>.</p>

			<p>*Thanks to my friend, Will Eberhardt: He tipped me to cultured butter (and FAGE Greek yogurt and lots of other great nutrition things). And he&#8217;s a vegetarian golfer (among other things). </p>
<p>Nutrition is the ultimate non-expert expertise: we are all engaging in its science and discovery each and every day.</p>
<p>Also, my ancestor, Dr. Francis. M. Pottenger, Jr. (see Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation), did fascinating research on the beneficial effects of animal fats and saturated lipids on skin and hair (epithelial tissue generally) health. Good hyperlipidity is a protective against skin cancer, for instance, most likely.</p>

			<p>Very interesting, never thought of a stick of butter as biscotti before!  My question is how would you, and other non-traditional lifestyle people educate and gain acceptance from the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; audience.  I am imagining Brent working out at the gym, then pulling out a stick of butter, instead of sugar filled power bars or gatorade.  That won&#8217;t fly with even &#8220;health conscious&#8221; workout nazis.  Yes, health conscious is a relative term, as many of them follow conventional beliefs when it comes to dieting.  </p>
<p>How do you make it stick with people?</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m partial to the idea of MetaRules.  Sounds like there are a lot of &#8220;don&#8217;ts&#8221; and absolutes and it sounds discouraging to me.  Probably a necessity and some are humorous, but still not very positive sounding.  </p>
<p>I tried my own n=2&#8230;2 because my girlfriend and I both experimented with a 90/10 mix of protein/veggies/fruits to 10% carbs and in about 4 weeks, we both lost a combined 8 lbs&#8230;  A positive side effect was that I ate more variety of veggies and meat, and more often because we wern&#8217;t filled up with &#8220;empty&#8221; carbs, like all the refined grains we were eating before.  So instead of a side of carbs, we would replace that with more greens and a larger portion of meat.</p>

			<p>Pottenger&#8217;s cats are fascinating nutritional research. Amazing that there&#8217;s a connection! Would also be interesting to see the research replicated.</p>

			<p>Stephen C, how will these ideas spread? you ask. I think the main thing that spreads ideas is repetition.</p>
