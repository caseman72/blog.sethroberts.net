		<description><![CDATA[I believe that art requires such a subtle, unconscious input that it is easy to see how psychology could be &#039;A&#039; bridge between it an science. Psychology may not be a pseudo-science per se, (I&#039;m a behavioral science major by hobby) but there are certainly large segments of it that even the most experienced psychologists don&#039;t understand - yet there certainly is a deep connection between what can be garnered from analyzing art as it pertains to the science of people. Just as much, there is definitely a provable science behind most of today&#039;s psychology.

Art is a wonderful breath of life to subconscious thinking. As such, used correctly (whatever that means), art can be a doorway into the thinking of people in order to understand the underlying science of what is going on, making it a perfect intermediary just as psychology could explain the science behind art.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I (an art teacher) would argue that most people believe that art can only be done by &quot;artists.&quot;  The biggest part of my job is either convincing my students that any one can be an artist, or if that fails convincing them that they are artists.  

I certainly held that belief about science and math as a young woman, and have only begun to realize how much the keen observation required in the arts is often a great path to scientific understanding.]]></description>
