		<description><![CDATA[Aaron, thanks, that&#039;s very interesting. Where did you get your bamboo socks? I see online they are $8/pair. Whereas socks in China are 30 cents/pair. And what observations are behind your idea about getting new shoes? It isn&#039;t so easy to see that point of that, since I&#039;ve managed to get rid of the visible problem without doing so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I&#039;ve personally noticed that the &quot;TYPE&quot; of sock matters the most.  Certain socks --- even the ones that say they wick the most moisture, were some of the socks that made my foot fungus the worst (because they fit so tight on the foot).  Now that I wear thin socks made out of mostly bamboo -- I have never had a problem, even if I rewear socks the second day.  Also, I notice that the type of shoe matters too.  You have to have shoes that are not too constrictive and let air in -- which is why I pick shoes with a lot of holes.  

I know I&#039;ve solved the problem because I had the problem from age 15 to  2 years ago which then I was 28.  Now I walk barefoot in gyms in the bathing area -- so i know I figured out the problem.

Bamboo socks or very very thin material that breathe=&#039;s  NO FOOT FUNGUS.

Shoes that breathe =&#039;s  NO FOOT FUNGUS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, it&#039;s true that one foot is sensitive to what socks I wear and the other isn&#039;t. But if I wear the right socks the problem disappears -- whether a background fungus remains or not. Perhaps wearing the right socks long enough will make the background fungus disappear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think your foot fungus is currently caused by socks. You&#039;ve got a background fungus which gets really active when you aren&#039;t meticulous about your socks.

I don&#039;t know what would really cure it so that you don&#039;t have to care about your socks any more than most people do, but it might be worth thinking about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you, Seth.  I find that I learn more from you and my therapists, not my psychiatrist.  My psychiatrist really tries to push medication as a coping skill, but he gives me a choice.  In the past, if I am not doing well, though, psychiatrists have to give me a medication forecfully, but when I am doing well, I can make a choice.  If I need a doctor&#039;s letter, my psychiatrist can help me get a lot of stuff in this society!!  That&#039;s my advantage.  From my experience, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary to depend on your doctor for everything.  Your blog really helped me to be more independent.  I actually didn&#039;t learn to think this way until I read your blog.  I&#039;ve been reading it for years.]]></description>
