		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth

After reading about using butter to &quot;feel better&quot; in your forums somewhere that mentioned this blog post, I decided to look into it. I read that butter is actually pretty good for you, assuming of course it&#039;s &quot;actual&quot; butter (not a veggie spread) and organic, raw is best if one can get it.

Aside from it including vitamins A, E, K and D(!) it is apparently also rich in Selenium and Iodine (another !), not to mention the Omega 3&#039;s and 6&#039;s you already brought up.

So, coupled with what you stated and what I found, I was convinced enough to give it a go. For the past couple of days (not much time - I know), I used a couple of straight teaspoons and noted that I am much happier and accepting than before - I laugh more too. Also, I seem to be sleeping better, but not if I take it right before bed time, which simply had me awake after roughly a 40 minute nap. I &quot;feel&quot; like I have a more energy, but want to wait a little longer to see how all this works out in the long run.

I did find an interesting way of taking it though. The Tibetans apparently make a butter-tea in large quantities and are said to drink upwards of 40 cups a day as it provides them with a large amount of energy, esp. during the winter months.

I gave it a go in regular black tea, by melting a tablespoon into it and adding just a smidge of creamer for colour. To my surprise it&#039;s actually really good! It&#039;s a rich, creamier texture and I will have no problems drinking this on a regular basis. I did use salted, non-organic pasteurized butter for this as it was the only type I could find on short notice - but will check out our local natural food place soon.

I have also wondered if using butter, in a non-tasting way (somehow), could be a different way of taking in non-flavoured calories? I may have read this somewhere though. The thinking is that, esp. with the Iodine, butter may be a decent way of bringing the weight down with your method. Any thoughts?

Anyway, thought I would share and thank you so very much for everything you do!

		<description><![CDATA[I have found a huge personal correlation between my mood and my fat intake.  I experienced severe depression after dieting and losing 60 pounds.  It wasn&#039;t the weight loss, even after I regained most of the weight, but maintained my low fat diet I was still depressed.  I started a high fat low carb meat based diet, and my mood improved greatly. 

Now, there are plenty of confounding issues, higher fat, lower carb, resumption of meat eating, etc.  But it really seems to me that there is a great improvement in my mood with fat consumption.  (My sleep disorder has improved as well.)  I am experimenting with different kinds of fat, coconut vs. grass fed butter, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Strauss is unique in that it is barely pasteurized and not homogenized. Pasteurization is a process which slows microbial growth, while homogenization keeps fat globules from separating out from the rest of the milk. 

Maybe these are also factors?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
The authors of the study write that lumping red meat and processed meats together is a mistake. I think it may also be a mistake to lump together luncheon meats and bacon. An article of a study by Shawkat Razzaque, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Medicine, Infection and Immunity at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine published on the Science Daily web site (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100426151636.htm)  finds that phosphates found un processed meats and sodas shorten the lives of mice by as much as 25 %. I have not found phosphates in bacon.

Surely people who eat a lot of (unprocessed) meat are different from those who eat much less, such as vegetarians. Yet in spite of all those differences, no difference in heart attack risk.

		<description><![CDATA[About that new study linking bacon and other processed meat to heart disease, Gary Taubes&#039;s comment about earlier epidemiological studies seems relevant:

 . . . in observational studies, such as the ones used to indict processed meat, the statistical significance is not nearly as meaningful as the confounders â€” those other factors that might explained the statistically-significant effect observed. With cigarettes and cancer, itâ€™s virtually impossible to imagine anything that could explain the 20-fold increase in lung cancer among heavy smokers (not that the tobacco industry didnâ€™t try). With these smaller relative risks, even those considerably larger than 2, itâ€™s all too easy to imagine confounding variables that the researchers either didnâ€™t measure or didnâ€™t properly assess . . .

Imagine for instance all the possible ways that the highest quintile of processed-meat eaters in the 1990s or 2000s might differ from the lowest quintile, particularly considering the fact that processed meats have been generally perceived as carcinogenic for thirty years or more. What youâ€™re comparing are people who donâ€™t seem to give a damn whether something is healthy or not (or people on the Atkins diet who are predisposed to gain weight easily) to health-conscious, quasi-vegetarians. The latter are probably better educated â€” a typical finding in all these studies â€” of a higher socioeconomic class; they go to better doctors, get better medical care, eat generally healthier diets (whatever that means), etc. etc. The reason to do randomized trials is to render irrelevant all these possible confounders â€” disseminate them equally among all the arms of the study. Without randomization, that an effect is statistically significant says virtually nothing at all about whether or not the cause of that effect is what you set out to study. The fact that RCTS are effectively impossible to do in these kinds of situations . . . doesnâ€™t negate the fact that theyâ€™re necessary to learn anything meaningful.

Meta-analysis can be meaningless in this context because itâ€™s quite easy for every study done, in every population, to have the same confounders. The only way to learn anything meaningful â€” short of getting an effect as large as the lung-cancer/cigarette association â€” is to do a randomized trial.

One of the lessons I learned from my early life reporting on high energy physics is known in that field as Panofskyâ€™s law (after Pief Panofsky, founder of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory): If you throw money at an effect, and it doesnâ€™t get bigger, it means itâ€™s not really there.

In nutritional epidemiology, if you throw money at an effect and it doesnâ€™t get bigger, you do a meta-analysis. It always struck me that the very fact of having to do a meta-analysis is pretty compelling evidence that the effect youâ€™re trying to nail down isnâ€™t real. I may be wrong, but Iâ€™ve yet to meet the epidemiologist who could explain why.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: Your new idea about butter is innovative!  You didn&#039;t note that your friend has schizoaffective disorder, which is a combination of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. So the butter is not just dealing with normal sadness, in this case.  I believe the butter can save suicidal, depressed people from going to the psychiatric hospitals, which cost way more than Straus butter.  I will tell my friends in the depression group about it.  I am interested to know about their experience eating it.  I will bring my Straus butter to them, so they don&#039;t have to buy it.  Straus butter is cheaper at Whole Foods than at Berkeley Bowl.]]></description>
