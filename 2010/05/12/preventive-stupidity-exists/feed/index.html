		<description><![CDATA[In regards to the Absence of Evidence is Evidence of Absence.
I ran into this earlier and nearly fell out of my chair.
While the logic is right the interpretation is false
The logical conclusion is
Probability of existence given evidence is greater than the probability of existence given absence of evidence.
which of course is TRUE.. but this doesn&#039;t suggest that 
Probability of existence given absence of evidence is equal to ZERO.
So ultimately this proof just says that absence of evidence is evidence of probable absence. Which is like saying &quot;I haven&#039;t seen one, so maybe it doesn&#039;t exist&quot; which is an unremarkable conclusion]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SkepticalCynic, you write: &quot;If we discover that A &amp; B are correlated. . . A &amp; B are just as likely to be unlinked as they were before.&quot; I disagree. I can think of hundreds of cases where the correlation between A and B reflected a linkage between them (linkage = A causes B, B causes A, or both have a common cause). That you can cite a few examples where you claim that A and B are correlated but none of these three cases is true doesn&#039;t make my hundreds of examples go away. Throughout scientific history, people have observed correlations and used them to suggest ideas that were then tested in various ways, such as experiments. Many of these ideas turned out to be true. One example is the idea that smoking causes lung cancer. It began with a correlation. Another example is the idea that maternal lack of folate causes neural tube defects in the fetus.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I find it a little bit bizarre that you regard &quot;correlation is not causation&quot; as a slogan intended to make you go away, rather than a core lesson from epistemology encouraging you to think more carefully.

If I may restate your views, you correctly state that there are four possibilities for the relationship between variables A &amp; B: (1) A causes B, (2) B causes A, (3) A &amp; B are caused by C, and (4) A &amp; B are not related.

If we discover that A &amp; B are correlated, you view this as reducing the likelihood of (4), and therefore necessarily increasing the likelihood of (1)-(3). This is false. A &amp; B are just as likely to be unlinked as they were before and you&#039;ve improperly updated your priors.

There are plenty of robust correlations (think super bowl winners and election results, cyclical &amp; counter-cyclical stocks, etc.) between variables that are, in fact, unrelated. Modern social science tools like GSS make it almost trivially easy to hunt for such correlations. 

Suppose someone told you there is a very robust correlation between holding a college degree and adult income level (this is a true statement). Do you therefore conclude that awarding twice the number of college degrees next year will substantially increase the lifetime wealth of the recipients? I would hope not, and anyone who so argued would indeed need to be reminded that &quot;correlation is not causation&quot;.

The bottom line is that if you want to show causation, you need to show it (c.f. Mill&#039;s Methods). The fact that no correlation is evidence for no causation does not imply the converse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Privileging zero correlation as a reliable indicator of the absence of a causal connection is dangerous because we are often interested in systems with feedback.

Think about a room with a thermostat. Perhaps there is broken cloud and the room is intermittently warmed by direct sunshine. If the heating is on, the thermostat turns it down when the sun comes out. It zeros out the correlation between room temperature and direct sunshine by creating a cancelling inverse correlation between direct sunshine and heat from the heating system.

On might argue that the thermostat can only weaken the correlation, there must be some change there to drive the operation of the thermostat. Not so fast. If the sunshine is hitting the thermostat we may well find the room cools down when the sun comes out and shuts down the heating. Feedback can drive the correlation down, down, down, right through zero and into confusingly negative.

Now think about the kinds of things we argue about. Consider, for example, a mature social democracy with taxes that have, for many years, wobbled about the Laffer Curve tipping point. The political system provides feedback that tends to null out the correlation between tax rates and tax revenue. Does zero correlation provide evidence that they are not causally connected?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dan, you ask, &quot;should raw correlation be used as a guide to public policy, as in the two instances Sam Fent described?&quot; Sure, in some cases. For example, the idea that smoking causes lung cancer is/was mostly based on &quot;raw correlations&quot; (if I understand what you mean by that). It would have been a bad idea to wait for better evidence of causation. When making public policy, I think it&#039;s a poor idea to ignore data -- which means not ignoring correlations. Should a single correlation of 0.10 be used to guide the spending of a billion dollars? Of course not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry, Seth, but you would fail a logic class.

2 is correct. 

Your counter claim is wrong, you&#039;re commiting the classic logical fallacy of confusting predicate and proposition: Zero is a predicate not a proposition. That is, you cannot talk of the &#039;zero&#039; of something, because, if it&#039;s zero then their is no &#039;something&#039; there.

So zero correlation does not equal zero causation - because zero correlation means that there is no correlation at all! Zero correlation equals zero. So it does not exist, so it cannot even enter into a argument. If there is zero correlation then the right hand side of this equasion is simply blank! If there is no correlation then there is nothing to be said about correlation. If two things aren&#039;t correlated, then the question does not even arrise as to wether or not they are caused. 

Consider another example: if i have two non-existant apples, and i polish them what do i have? Two non-existant shiny apples? No - you never had any apples to begin with, coz , they dont exist! Thus if their is &#039;zero correlation&#039;, which is another way of saying there is a &#039;non-existant correlation&#039;. Then an &#039;non-existant correlation&#039; is the same as &#039;non-existant causation&#039;. Well duh! &#039;Non-existant correlation&#039; is also exactly the same as &#039;non-existant magic elves&#039;, and the same as &#039;non-existant santa clause&#039;. Ofcourse two things that are dont exist are are going to be equal. All you&#039;ve proved is that zero equals zero.

Look let me spell it out in an argument form example:

Argument A:
Correlation is not the same as causation
But no correlation is the same as no causation
Therefor, correlation is exactly the same as causation 

is the same as:

Argument B:
Marriage is not the same as Happy Marriage
But not being Married is the same as not being Happy Married
Therefor, being married is exactly the same as being happily married.

The Argument B is clearly wrong and loopy, and your Argument A is loopy because it commits the same logical fallacy.

To use a more common analogy: it&#039;s like you divided by zero.



As for 3, &quot;The plural of anecdote is not data.&quot;

Depends, the word data could have two different meanings here. Both of which you confused. By data you might mean information, in which case 3 is right. But really data is different from information. But when you recognise the distinction, then your criticism is true but irrelevant. 

The word &#039;Data&#039; comes latin, and means &#039;to give&#039;. It is what is &#039;given&#039; for free. Data, or what is given, has to be worked on and refined into &#039;Facts&#039;. Fact from the latin &#039;Fac&#039; meaning &#039;to make&#039; (as in factory and manufacture). In computer science Data is just a collection of meaningless points, then it has to be refined and processed into Information (or facts). BUT only information (or facts) can form the evidence for an argument. Where as, data is meaningless and valueless it should never be used as evidence for an argument. 

So when you claim that people can learn things by reasoning from the data, this is flatly wrong... 

The data &#039;the given&#039; stuff first needs to be examined to discover if it is of any worth or value, and to say what that worth or value is. Data is value neutral, it can be either good or bad, useful or worthless; it is all still data. When you have discouted the data that is rubbish, and analysised the remaining data according to it&#039;s worth, then it has become Information. INFORMATION CAN the be used an evidence in an argument to reach conclusion. DATA should NEVER be used as evidence for anything.]]></description>

   Now hang on a second.  Sam just brought up two perfectly legitimate instances where correlation/causation confusion led directly to bad public policy, in bike helmets, and in early childhood education.  Your reply, unless I&#039;m totally misreading it, was that neither action was the result of science, just politics:  The bike helmet study authors knew they were being misleading, the the governor knew he was doing something worthless but it looked good for the voters.

   On the one hand, sure, that&#039;s the real world, we don&#039;t necessarily have policy based on science. On the other hand, you&#039;re not exactly being a neutral advocate here.  In fact, you seem to be advocating this baldly unscientific behavior.  But maybe I&#039;m being presumptuous.  So let me put it to you very plainly:

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: The problem seems to be that you think that &quot;Correlation does not imply causation&quot; is a useless slogan because scientists already know that correlation does not imply causation.

However, the fact is that many non-scientists also read studies, see correlations and then leap to &quot;causations.&quot; Such non-scientists may be people in decision-making positions, such as legislators and educators. When faced with arguments assuming causation when there is only evidence for causation, I think that reminding people of the slogan is useful.

For instance: there are numerous statistics that show a correlation between increased helmet usage and increased bicycle accidents. This has lead many people to assume that wearing bicycle helmets causes accidents.

An example can be seen at http://www.ctcyorkshirehumber.org.uk/campaigns/velo.htm. The authors cite the statistics showing the correlations, mention in passing that there could be other causes for the increase in bike accidents (such as increases in ridership), yet still go on to state multiple times that &quot;evidence shows helmet use increases the accident rate.&quot;

No, the evidence cited does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; show that helmet use increases the accident rate, and yet this is a serious legislative campaign that may seriously affect bike helmet laws. (Whether one agrees with bike helmet laws is irrelevant with respect to the science involved.)

In a similar vein (this time from Freakonomics): after studies showed that there was a strong correlation between children&#039;s test scores and the number of books in a child&#039;s home, then-Governor Blagojevich announced a plan to send every child in the state one book a month until they reached kindergarten, apparently under the assumption that the physical presence of books in the home would actually cause the children to become smarter. Again, a time when the mistaken assumption that correlation implies causation almost had large legislative effects. (Again, one might agree with sending books to children&#039;s homes, but one should not conclude from the correlation studies that the books might make the kids smarter.]]></description>

   If I may distill your argument, &quot;Since lack of correlation makes causation less likely, correlation must make causation more likely.&quot;

   Here is another logical statement in this family:  &quot;Since I am not drowning, it is more likely that I am flying.&quot;

   Yep.  That is entirely true.  It is more likely.  Very, very, microscopically more likely.  And there&#039;s your problem right there:

   You are allowing any increase in confidence to imply plausibility, no matter how small.  And that, unfortunately, is untrue.  Consider, for a moment, the number of metrics in the universe right now that have increased in the last year.  They are all correlated, Seth.

   They are not all causative.  In fact, the odds that any two randomly selected correlative metrics have even a remote chance of being reflective of a causative relationship is infinitesimal.

   Now, you can filter your correlative sets, looking for those where a relationship is plausible.  But -- and here&#039;s the key -- the plausibility doesn&#039;t come from the correlation.  The plausibility comes from the fact that you&#039;re a really smart guy, with a theory of the world, against which you can compare sets of relationships.  It is your theory that allows you to know where to look, to design your experiments.

   Mere correlations are rough filters.  It is in fact the case that there are more metrics overall than there are correlative metrics.  But it is a very, very, *very* low quality information source -- good for exclusion, but wayyyyyyyyy too conflated for inclusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ryan, I&#039;m afraid this is beside the point -- I was writing about whether sayings such as &quot;correlation doesn&#039;t equal causation&quot; are helpful. Not about what can be inferred from correlations. But you&#039;re right, we do disagree here. Let&#039;s say X causes Y. Then usually we would expect them to be correlated. We start with four possibilities: X causes Y, Y causes X, both are caused by something else, and X and Y are unlinked. When we observe lack of correlation it reduces the plausibility of X and Y are unlinked. The plausibilities of all 4 events must add to 1. Reducing one of the four must increase the sum of the other three. Thus unless we&#039;re sure of an alternative explanation for the correlation, observation of the correlation should increase the plausibility that X causes Y.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I am glad that I pursued this because I think I have found at least one core point of disagreement between us. Let me see if I state your views clearly:

You think that correlation says something about causation because causation requires correlation. You think that finding a correlation between X and Y can make us more confident that X causes Y (than we were before finding the correlation).

On this particular issue, what bothers me is that finding a correlation between X and Y might make us more confident that X and Y are related, but it says absolutely nothing about causal order (or spuriousness). Moyo uses a correlation (poverty/low savings &amp; foreign aid) to argue for causation. You could just as easily use the same regressions to argue that poverty causes aid to increase, because aid is intentionally directed at poor countries.

So, while finding a correlation should increase our confidence that something is linking X and Y together, it should not increase our confidence that X causes Y, because it adds an exactly equal amount of evidence to the argument that Y causes X. This is why we can&#039;t move from correlation to causation. 

Obviously, pointing this out is useful a starting point instead of an ending.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

   If your slogan is data, not slogans, why are you proclaiming the value of an absence of data?

   Burdens of proof matter.  The problem is that there are a tremendously large set of things for which we lack data.  It is tempting to convert that into an information source -- well, we don&#039;t know that the core of the earth isn&#039;t, in fact, made of giant radioactive turtles -- but down that path comes insufficient predictive powers.

   Your problem is you see the world through too clear a lens.  Bear with me a for a moment.  You&#039;re a really smart guy (and I enjoyed your diet, btw).  Your experience of absent evidence comes only after a presumption that, were certain things to be true, there would be specific things present.  So you&#039;re seeing violated predictions, which is not actually the same thing as absent evidence.

   It&#039;s similar for your experience of correlations and anecdotes.  These things are preconditions for your entire processing framework.  You&#039;ve _already filtered out_ the useless correlations and anecdotes, a massive number of which could simply be dumped into this comment thread.

   And that&#039;s OK.  Without course grain loose data to guide us, we&#039;d never be able to form a useful hypothesis to test.  Exceedingly noisy data has its uses.

   What you&#039;re missing is the alternate universe, where the burden of proof is shifted, where correlations guide policy, where one person&#039;s story is enough to guide the reality we operate in.  That world sucks, Seth.  Consider the situation of alternative medicine.  Some of it works.  Damned if we have any idea what -- there is so much noise pretending to be signal.

   What you&#039;re missing about the alternate universe, specifically, is that not everybody is you, and there&#039;s an infinite set of unevidenced correlated anecdotes that *you&#039;d* filter and *they* wouldn&#039;t that *the truth* would have to compete with.]]></description>
