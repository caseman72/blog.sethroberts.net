		<description><![CDATA[Bruce, apparently drunkenness is a huge problem in Mongolia:

&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3138806.stm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mongolia&#039;s drinking epidemic&lt;/a&gt;&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Heavy drinking in Mongolia is nothing new. Genghis Khan was reputed to have consumed huge quantities of alcohol after vanquishing his enemies.

But today, alcoholism is reaching epidemic proportions, driven by cheap liquor and wrenching social and economic change.

I visited a young man lying on an old iron bedstead in a bare white room inside an Ulan Bator hospital. The man was an alcoholic and this desolate room was his last resort. [...]

This young man&#039;s story is far from unique.

Mongolia is today in the midst of an epidemic of alcoholism. On the streets of Ulan Bator you do not have to go far to see its effects.

Ulan Bator railway station, even at 10am in the morning, was already crawling with drunks, many of them already so intoxicated they could hardly stand. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

So if you want peace, be peaceful. A la Gandhi - be the change you want to see in the world.

Btw, what do people around there think about incarnation, Seth? Westerners are taught they are a body, die, and that&#039;s it for their existence, as you probably know ;-)]]></description>
