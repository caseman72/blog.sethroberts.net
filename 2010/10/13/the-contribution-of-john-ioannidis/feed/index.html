		<description><![CDATA[Another important contribution to bias not mentioned is the fact the once there is an accepted hypothesis, people look for confirmation, rather than refutation, which is required for truly critical scientific method.  One huge institutional impediment to a healthy balance of refutation is the peer review process employed by almost all journals.  If there is not even any place to publish, and in turn debate, negative results and possible alternate hypotheses, how can our existing hypotheses be anything but biased?  

One of the last places unbiased debate was fostered was Medical Hypotheses, which did not practice standard peer review.  However Elsevier, the huge publishing house that publishes Medical Hypotheses, sacked the editor-in-chief and installed peer review, because of the publication of a controversial scientific hypothesis about AIDS.  Rather than let a scientific debate of the merits, or lack there of, of the hypothesis proceed, this important forum for unbiased scientific debate was stifled for good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s a common reluctance to find environmental cause for degenerative conditions because drug companies fund so much research. You can&#039;t &#039;cure&#039; environmental causes by selling a pharmaceutical drug for the environment to take. Better to blame the victim/patient for the ill-health and then treat them with profitable drugs or other profitable procedures.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, instincts can be clouded by habit.  There&#039;s a signal that tells you &#039;enough chocolate, time to eat some lettuce&#039;, but people binge on chocolate for dysfunctional reasons and dietary advice has very, very limited power to override these compulsions.  

I know someone who eats an incredible amount of sugar and is slim and healthy-looking.  She is also a vegetarian.  For all we know, she&#039;s suited to that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;They would have been better served by tradition and instinct.&quot; I agree, if the right tradition is chosen. There are plenty of harmful traditions. The Chinese have a tradition of eating rice. Bad idea. They eat little animal fat (can&#039;t afford it). Bad idea. And instinct, too, is a good guide to something but it isn&#039;t always clear what. Why do we like sweet things? So we will eat more candy? No.

perhaps bias is a &quot;huge&quot; problem. I meant it strikes me as a smaller problem that the two others I name.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You can allow for bias!?  Allowing for bias is non-bias.  I think it is a huge problem.  

You might have your own (right or wrong) sense that you can surf the nutritional data and get your best result but I think that &#039;ignore it all&#039; might be good advice for most people.  The stuff you say people should eat (butter, pork fat...) has been shunned for years by people who paid attention to studies.  They would have been better served by tradition and &lt;i&gt;instinct&lt;/i&gt; than by attempting to grapple with masses of data and conflicting opinion &lt;i&gt;even if&lt;/i&gt; they had the time and educational means.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read the article about Ionnidis, but your blog post reminds me of this excellent paper on the placebo effect:

Roberts, Alan H., Kewman, Donald G., Mercier, Lisa, Hovell, Mel (1993).&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/31080/1/0000757.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The power of nonspecific effects in healing: Implications for psychosocial and biological treatments.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;i&gt;Clinical Psychology Review&lt;/i&gt; 13(5): 375-391.

&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We evaluate the hypothesis that the power of nonspecific effects may account for as much as two thirds of successful treatment outcomes when both the healer and the patient believe in the efficacy of a treatment. Five medical and surgical treatments, once considered to be efficacious by their proponents but no longer considered effective based upon later controlled trials, were selected according to strict inclusion criteria. A search of the English literature was conducted for all studies published for each treatment area. The results of these studies were categorized, where possible, into excellent, good, and poor outcomes. For these five treatments combined, 40 % excellent, 30 % good, and 30 % poor results were reported by proponents. We conclude that, under conditions of heightened expectations, the power of nonspecific effects far exceeds that commonly reported in the literature. The implications of these results in evaluating the relative efficacy of biological and psychosocial treatments is discussed.
