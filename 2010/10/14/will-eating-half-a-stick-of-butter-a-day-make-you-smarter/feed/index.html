		<description><![CDATA[Seth:

In the large grant case, all this shows is that the study&#039;s funds were used ineffectively, is says nothing about the efficacy of having smaller sample sizes. All we can say is that (1) a bunch of money was wasted, and (2) there wasn&#039;t enough data to perform a meaningful analysis. If you are arguing this particular university did not issue funding in an efficient manner, I wholeheartedly agree with you. But, what does this have to do with the efficacy of small sample sizes?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;What mistakes?&quot; Here&#039;s an example.

Alex, you ask if my results &quot;could be an outlier&quot;. The history of nutrition is a good guide.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:

I can see how my response may seem rhetorical, since I am actually echoing the established viewpoint. The reason why I adopt it, is given by the above example of a product line, where one is checking for defects. Logically, I cannot see how one can learn more from a smaller sample. This example illustrates why we should not opt out of collecting more data points. In fact, it can be shown that no useful information can be gained from doing so. We will not be able to tell whether the items in the sample are a fluke, or not, etc. So, I&#039;ve explained my position. It&#039;s time to back up your claim by applying it to the situation that I posed. 

Your argument to &quot;less is more&quot;, is that we are susceptible to making more mistakes. What mistakes? Bias? We have techniques to lessen the amount of bias attributed to every sampling method. Do you disagree with these methods? If so, why?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[majamin, I&#039;m still curious: where do your beliefs come from? They strike me as highly incomplete.

Your puzzlement (&quot;how would less observation give us the ability to understand it better?&quot;) is why I wrote what I did: because it wasn&#039;t obvious. You&#039;re just describing the conventional point of view. I&#039;m well aware of that view. But why do you believe it? To be even a little bit convincing you have to explain that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Of course assumptions are counter-productive, and can render any data collection to be fruitless. There are many other things that need to be considered (bias, blinding, etc.). With these in place, you have the beginning of a robust study. 

&quot;the bigger the experiment the more assumptions&quot;

No. Every data point that is collected does not mean one more assumption. Bias in sampling can creep in, of course, but that does not mean that less data should be used. It just means that the data if you are collecting data, you need to ensure that it is collected with a good dose of randomness.

The claim made above was &quot;less data is better&quot;. Let&#039;s focus on that. That&#039;s like saying that, in sampling a product line for an estimated number of defected products, the less amount of data you collect, the better. Like I said in my first post, at one point the collection of data would become difficult (i.e. the resources required to test for defects), but how could less data teach you more? Why would you chose to sample less number of products? Can you give a good reason why doing this would result in a better understanding of the situation?

The same with any other observation of our world ... how would less observation give us the ability to understand it better? Please point me to a (mathematical, if possible,) analysis that would show that less data you have, the better.

Sincerely,

majamin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This is my first rule of science: Do less.&quot; 

&quot;Same with data collection. A little goes a long way and a lot goes a little way.&quot;

&quot;A tiny amount of data collection will teach you more than you expect.&quot;

&quot;A large amount will teach you less.&quot;

No. Absolutely not. Science hinges on good sampling methods, and the more data, the better. You will eventually exhaust resources in order to obtain this data, this data may be difficult to collect, but a good statistician / scientist would never say &quot;no&quot; to more data. Especially if it is collected in a manner that sheds light on interesting relationships and phenomena, and especially if we want meaningful outcomes. A small amount of data can suggest further study, but these can never be relied upon to make confident and accurate decisions.]]></description>

Yes, better software could certainly help. R is not designed for data collection but I use it anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do less. I love it. Really, I do.

But, at least this once, I want to have the experience of running a study with as many participants as are willing.  

It&#039;s going to be a data mess at first. But I hope that, soon enough, online platforms will be capable of automating this type of study.  However, I&#039;ll probalby still spend the majority of my test time on myself. :)

Thanks so much for your curiosity and testing, Seth. It is quite the inspiration.

		<description><![CDATA[Venkat from rinnonfarm.com had an interesting post apropos a little data versus a lot of data:

http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/09/28/learning-from-one-data-point/

The gist IIRC is that when you collect a lot of data, you may stop thinking deeply about a problem, whereas one piece of data tends to force you to think deeply, I think mainly about how cause and effect might act in this particular case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, how do you rule out the so called placebo effect?

Human attitude/intention influences the outcome.

IMHO such trials tell the one human that observes himself if his approach worked or if he should try different. And different can start with different attitude.

Btw antibiotics reduced acne for me; at that time I believed doctors and in medicine ;-) I will probably never use anything like that again, though, now that I am less clueless.

I haven&#039;t thought this through, it just came into my mind while reading your blog post.

Be well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like rule zero :-)
Thanks for replying to my email. Your comment makes great sense in context. Making the mistakes up front with less effort gets results more quickly and may illuminate ways of improving future studies. There will always be the possibility of doing more rigorous studies later.]]></description>
