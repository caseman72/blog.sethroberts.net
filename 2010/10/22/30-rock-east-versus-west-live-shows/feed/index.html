		<description><![CDATA[The book, record, radio show, TV show, computer game, and presumably the play, of the HItchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy are all substantially different. (The play exists; I haven&#039;t seen it. Time was I could have expounded on the deep dissimilarities of the others.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I speak Russian.  In certain movies (example: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090319/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;White Nights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), English subtitles appear on the screen when some of the characters are speaking Russian.  I&#039;ve noticed an odd tendency for the subtitles to be different from what&#039;s actually being said.  The differences are not critical to the plot, but still... I wonder why that happens?

It&#039;s been a while since I saw &lt;i&gt;White Nights&lt;/i&gt;, but as I recall, there is one scene where a Soviet KGB agent -- speaking Russian -- says something like, &quot;I&#039;ve seen enough.  Let&#039;s go back to headquarters&quot;.  The subtitles said something like, &quot;Turn the car around. We&#039;re not needed here.&quot;]]></description>
