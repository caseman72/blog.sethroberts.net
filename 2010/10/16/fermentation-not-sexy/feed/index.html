		<description><![CDATA[As opposed to Alex, I like my Kimchi stinky. The stuff from the store is just not stinky or flavorful enough.

Kimchi&#039;s not as easy to make as kombucha, but it&#039;s still pretty easy. It is easier than most traditional asian dishes; perhaps the woman meant it is hard if you consume a lot of it. (e.g are feeding a family.) I can make it much more regularly than kombucha, since a little cabbage goes a long way.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drbenkim.com/how-make-kim-chi.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the recipe I use. (Also first hit on a Google search &quot;how to make kimchi&quot;, I believe.) It&#039;s turned out great for me. I&#039;ve experimented with vegetables other than nappa and also using various fruits as sugar sources. My two month old (non-spicy) watermelon yu-choy kimchi was the best one so far.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kimchee is not too hard to make on your own.  If you have Sandor Katz&#039;s book Wild Fermentation, there is a simple, authentic and easy recipe and it takes about a week to ferment.  I did it last winter (made a quart) and it was good.  There&#039;s also a fruit kimchee recipe that I&#039;m hankering to try soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I tried making kim chee a couple of months ago.  It didn&#039;t taste nearly as good as the stuff I can buy at the store, though I think I might know why my attempt didn&#039;t work.  I made it during the heat of summer, in a non-air-conditioned space.  An acquaintance later told me that kim chee does best when it ferments at a cooler temperature.  I will try again.  In the meantime, I buy kim chee made by Hawthorne Valley Farm.  It&#039;s made without fish or shrimp.]]></description>
