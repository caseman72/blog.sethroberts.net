		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think the Noble prize should be held in such reverence any longer. It results in stupid competition amongst scientists. Nassim Taleb has rightly criticized the &quot;Nobel&quot; prize in economics. It is perhaps time to evaluate whether the Nobel prize should be held in such high regards due to it is clearly a subjective and flawed way of selecting. Though it does bring attention to science amongst the general public.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, that&#039;s a good point. And it raises an interesting question: how did those medical ethicists manage to convince other people to &lt;strong&gt;pay &lt;/strong&gt;them -- to give them a full-time job! -- to tell the rest of us how to feel? In particular, when to feel bad. Quite an achievement. Other academic jobs have at least a vague connection with improving people&#039;s lives.]]></description>
