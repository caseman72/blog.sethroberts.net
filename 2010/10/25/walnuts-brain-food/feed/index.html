		<description><![CDATA[Seth, Alex - people have instincts for what is good for them.  Babies self-select a balanced diet when given a variety of foods to choose from freely.  This implies that there is a nutrition &#039;sense&#039;.  This sense may be strong enough to communicate with the conscious mind.  If only a few &#039;sensitives&#039; develop the idea that walnuts enhance the brain, they may disseminate the idea into their culture even if most people are not nutritionally sensitive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you are going to be hard pressed to find any chemical component to support the walnut-brain theory.  It is based on a sort of doctrine of correspondence and it will defy any rational investigation.

Let&#039;s take another example of this.  According to the Chinese, beans will help the kidneys (because most beans look something like a kidney).  I dare you to find a chemical component of beans that are particularly good for the kidneys.

What we are dealing with here is human projection.  The same logic that gave the planet Mars its name and said that it ruled anger, aggression and war on Earth (most certainly in part because of its red color).  Now, if you want to consider whether or not such a thing is true, you may want to look at statistics (as Gauqelin did with Mars), but I don&#039;t think if you went up and took a soil sample (or measured any other physical parameters) of Mars that you would find anything that would suggest that it could influence aggression on Earth.  Same goes for walnuts, beans, or tiger testicles, etc, vis a vis human health.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I replaced Splenda with Now Stevia Balance, which contains 900 mg inulin per packet.  Inulin is a prebiotic; as you are probably aware, prebiotics stimulate the growth of helpful gut bacteria.  I have migrated to the belief that prebiotics are as important as probiotics.  Now that I ingest more prebiotics daily, I have fewer issues with dairy foods.

As for walnuts, I wonder if a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner would recommend walnuts for brain function?  There may be a difference between folklore and what TCM recommends.

Another thing about walnuts . . . the Omega 6 to 3 ratio of English walnuts is 4:1 (or 5:1, depending on source), which is a decent ratio for a food which is typically added to a meal.  If one&#039;s meal consists of rice, soy sauce, vegetables, fish, and a few walnuts, the overall ratio probably calculates close to a desirable Omega 6:3 ratio.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, no I don&#039;t have reason to believe it is less harmful. You make a good point, I should try giving it up and see what happens.

Stephen, thanks for the references. The book makes a good point, that walnuts have far more omega-6 than omega-3. They have more omega-3 than other nuts but, if omega-6 is bad, you could easily argue that walnuts should have a bad effect on brain function.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;m surprised that you eat a lot of Splenda.  I used to eat it, but I gave it up after reading your blog post titled, &quot;Splenda Reduces Gut Bacteria in Rats&quot; (from Nov. 22, 2009).  Do you now have reason to believe that Splenda is less harmful than other sweeteners?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since the putative brain-enhancing effect of the walnuts is probably subtle, can we reasonably expect the Chinese to have discovered it in the absence of careful, quantitative testing?

I&#039;ve experimented with making a type of walnut butter by using a blender to combine shelled walnuts and coconut oil.  It tastes better than coconut oil alone, though it&#039;s still not exactly tasty.  I&#039;ve been eating it in addition to flaxseed oil.  Now that I think about it, though, I wonder if grinding-up the walnuts makes the omega-3 degrade any faster.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe they don&#039;t put fluoride into the tap water, like they do in some US cities. You can check that with the water supplier. They say they add it because it allegedly reduces suicide and criminal rates.

And maybe you leave out artificial sweetener and other excitotoxins, possibly unknowingly.

And maybe they don&#039;t have the chemtrails there that you may have been victim to in the past.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemtrail_conspiracy_theory
People with a still usable brain can see that some of the trails slowly descend and widen. Well, I can.

<p>And maybe they don&#8217;t have the chemtrails there that you may have been victim to in the past.<br />

People with a still usable brain can see that some of the trails slowly descend and widen. Well, I can.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is an interesting anecdote that my Indian colleague related.  It turns out that people used to sprinkle turmeric on the threshold of the front door of their house in India.  As it turns out, due to the anti-bacterial action of the turmeric, this may have produced some benefits, as the bacteria on the bottom of people&#039;s feet would have been destroyed/diminished as they entered the house.  However, at some point, this turned into a superstition.  People thought it was THE COLOR that was beneficial and so they started painting the house entrance with the color of turmeric.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many culture, such as the Chinese and Indian (see SB&#039;s comment above) view form and function as connected in terms of their effects on human health and well being. In some cases this makes sense. If you have a problem with fertility, take tiger penis (or some reproductive organ) and it should help you. The reproductive organs of other animals likely have many of the same compounds that our endocrine system uses and so you&#039;re basically taking a drug. In other cases, like walnuts, the link between form and function is likely just coincidental. Are there other things that look like brains (brain coral?) that won&#039;t help with brain function when consumed? Are there other things that don&#039;t look like brains (sardines) that will? It would be fascinating to see how systematically these principles are applied in the societies that practice them.]]></description>
