		<description><![CDATA[Seth, why do you take flaxseed instead of cod liver oil.  Just a pointer to a previous post or short answer if you have time.  Thanks for the great blog.

		<description><![CDATA[I had a similar experience. I had badly bleeding gums - even just brushing (not flossing) would cause bleeding. It would be red when I spit out, not just pink. I started taking cod liver oil (Carlson&#039;s) - 1 teaspoon per day. Originally I started taking it for general health, not thinking there would be any relation to the health of my gums. What I subsequently noticed was that the bleeding gums almost completely disappeared. That plus flossing regularly (every other day) seems to have eliminated the problem completely for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, the correlations were weak and no effect was found for linolenic acid because (a) there are many sources of error (such as dietary recall, measurement of omega-3 in foods, etc.) and (b) the range was small. People in the highest group didn&#039;t consume that much, compared to what I consumed.

Robert, I eat one ordinary low-carb meal (no rice, no potatoes, no bread, no noodles) plus 2 servings of yogurt with walnuts plus 1/2 stick of butter plus 2 tablespoons flaxseed oil.

Jeff, my finding that flaxseed oil quickly improved how well my brain worked can be a bioassay for omega-3: a way to compare different sources by seeing how effective they are inside the body. I intend to compare flaxseed oil with ground flaxseed, for example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 

I would be interested to know what you eat over the course of the day to put this in context. Still one meal plus 2 fruits and oil? What does your meal consist of usually?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this issue has been brought up before, its difficult to refer to fish oil or any sort of &quot;omega 3&quot; oil in general terms.

general label &quot;fish oil&quot; 
col liver oil
fermented cod liver oil
cod liver with K2
wild salmon oil
flax
flax/fish blends

all could react differently in tests and could deliver different results depending more on the existing diet (ie: noticeable effects when omega 6 ratio is brought back to balance vs. none if diet remains)

we would really need to see a differnt approach to these omega 3 studies.]]></description>
