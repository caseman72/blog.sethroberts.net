		<description><![CDATA[Breakfast causes what&#039;s called &quot;anticipatory activity&quot; -- which includes waking up. If you eat breakfast at a certain time you will tend to wake up 3 hours earlier. Anticipatory activity is easy to see in pets, which become active about 3 hours before the time of day they are fed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[According to my Zeo data I am a poor sleeper, and I&#039;m sure that is a correct assessment. I always eat a significant vegetarian breakfast within an hour of arising. For the last two months, Zeo says: ZQ=48, TotalZ=5.2 hours, REM= 108 min, Wake= 92 min, Times woken=8, Deep Sleep=28min.
I have great difficulty getting off to sleep, it may take 45 to 190 minutes. I sleep very restlessly, motion IR camera recordings indicate 80-200 limb movements per session. [limb movements often occur during periods flagged by Zeo as REM !].
I am not very good at the Zeo subjective estimates, but I reckon my &quot;sleep stealer&quot; score must be pretty low because I do not do anything obviously wrong.
I am fascinated by the &quot;no breakfast for 3 hours after waking&quot; recommendation. How is that thought to work?

		<description><![CDATA[Eric, imho the best way to get up, is to sleep as long as you need to, not until a clock alarms you to get up.

I do it that way as of now, and it works great for me ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t like to eat (breakfast) in the morning. I&#039;m not hungry at all, and usually I take have, or take, the time to make breakfast. 

What will trigger the effect of waking up in the morning? The intake of fat, the intake of protein, the intake of carbs, a combination, or any of the before mentioned?

I have troubles getting up in the morning and would like to get a kickstart. Let&#039;s see the responses, and if no clear answer: I&#039;ll start another n=1 experiment!]]></description>
