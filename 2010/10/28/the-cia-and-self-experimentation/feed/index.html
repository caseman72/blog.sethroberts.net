		<description><![CDATA[Officially there are 16 &quot;Intelligence&quot; Agencies established for the USA
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community
Does that seem excessive to anyone besides me? I find it odd there&#039;s need for one at all, but actually 16?

I read somewhere that the CIA is permitted to keep its profit, which goes in line with the &quot;get rich&quot; part.

And I concur with your science statements, Seth. Simplicity rules, especially with so much disinformation around; self verifiably insight is needed. And self experimentation actually gives results that are relevant to you, the one experimenting ;-)

I&#039;m at a point where I&#039;m sure science is heavily used to dumb society down.]]></description>
