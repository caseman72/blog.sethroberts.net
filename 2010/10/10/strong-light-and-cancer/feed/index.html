		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Seth,

This is my first post. Thanks for your lively discussions.

You wrote:

&quot;If reducing circadian amplitude increases cancer, it follows that getting more light during the day — which surely increases circadian amplitude — will reduce cancer.&quot;

I disagree. Getting more light during the day cannot solve a problem caused by too much light at night, or even significantly mitigate it. 

From the New Yorker article:
&quot;...melatonin...production is severely diminished in people exposed to light at night.&#039;”

&quot;Severely&quot; is right. We are diurnal creatures. Even a tiny amount of light at night interrupts the pineal gland&#039;s secretion of melatonin. Melatonin is the main hormonal cause of sleep, dreams, loss of appetite loss during sleep, etc. It is a huge factor in circadian amplitude: restoring the waking half of it by a couple percentage points does not compare to continuing to lose tens of points on the sleeping half. 

The study of melatonin and its primary role in sleep and rest goes back decades. There is nothing premature about it.

Here is the website of a long-time self-experimenter whose rigorous elimination of nightlight helped him with his particular illness, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a collagen disorder:

The study also is only looking at one kind of cancer. The conclusions and tentative hypotheses of any study need to be restricted and as narrow as the study itself.]]></description>
