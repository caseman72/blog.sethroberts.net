		<description><![CDATA[Several aspects of Laura Fisher&#039;s comments are factually incorrect in regards to Intermountain Healthcare.

First, Intermountain Healthcare does not own most of the hospital beds in Utah in surrounding states.

Intermountain owns 21 of Utah&#039;s 59 hospitals and operates only about 40 percent the 6,258 hospital beds in the state.

Intermountain owns only one hospital outside of Utah, a small 25-bed hospital in Idaho.  Intermountain does not have any facilities in other states besides Utah and Idaho (as noted, a minor presence in Idaho).

Lastly, only about 900 physicians in Utah are employed by Intermountain, out of nearly 5,000 licensed doctors in the state.  The University of Utah Medical Center is actually the largest employer of doctors in Utah.

I think those 900 physicians employed by Intermountain would likely have an opinion different than Ms. Fisher.

Given the way she plays loose with the facts I have to wonder about her objectivity and motivations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kirsch&#039;s view of the STAR*D trial is described by Louis Menand in The New Yorker:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One objection to Kirsch&#039;s argument is that response to antidepressants is extremely variable. It can take several different prescriptions to find a medication that works. Measuring a single antidepressant against a placebo is not a test of the effectiveness of antidepressants as a category. And there is a well-known study, called the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression, or STAR*D trial, in which patients were given a series of different antidepressants. Though only thirty-seven per cent recovered on the first drug, another nineteen per cent recovered on the second drug, six per cent on the third, and five per cent after the fourth -- a sixty-seven-per-cent effectiveness rate for antidepressant medication, far better than the rate achieved by a placebo.

Kirsch suggests that the result in STAR*D may be one big placebo effect. He cites a 1957 study at the University of Oklahoma in which subjects were given a drug that induced nausea and vomiting, and then another drug, which they were told prevents nausea and vomiting. After the first anti-nausea drug, the subjects were switched to a different anti-nausea drug, then a third, and so on. By the sixth switch, a hundred per cent of the subjects reported that they no longer felt nauseous -- even though every one of the anti-nausea drugs was a placebo.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Source: http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2010/03/01/100301crat_atlarge_menand?currentPage=2

Note: Menand has been criticized for his sobriety and lack of extreme opinions; this article is no exception. However, it does contain several cogent observations, and at least a hint of a coming &quot;train wreck&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So the antidepressant business looks like a demolition derby -- a collision of negative research results, questionable research and regulatory practices, and popular disenchantment with the whole pharmacological regime. And it may soon turn into something bigger, something more like a train wreck. If it does, it&#039;s worth remembering that we have seen this movie before.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does anybody know of a good book that deals with the sociological prejudices regarding diagnosis?  Perhaps that unclear, so I will give examples.

A woman with whom I worked has a son who was diagnosed with ADHD.  The boy did indeed have a hard time studying in the usual sense of the word.  He just couldn&#039;t sit down a read books.  However, here&#039;s the thing.  The kid was a mechanical genius of sorts.  He&#039;s now 19 (and apparently having a brilliant career in the Navy as an airplane mechanic), however, even as a child, the neighbors would ask him to their house whenever they needed something put together.

You see where I am going with this.  Different strokes for different folks.  We have one model of how people are supposed to be nowadays and, if you don&#039;t fit that model, well, your are labelled as &quot;faulty&quot;.  How many of these people on psychiatric drugs are just people who have been prodded out of their proper niche or haven&#039;t found it yet?  How much of this is chemical and how much of it is sociological?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, here is a more-recent critique of STAR*D:

&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mad-in-america/201008/the-stard-scandal-new-paper-sums-it-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The STAR*D Scandal: A New Paper Sums It All Up&lt;/a&gt;&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Allan Leventhal and David Antonuccio were able to make sense of that mysterious graphic on page 1319, and they reported that only 108 patients -- out of the initial cohort of 3,671 -- had a &quot;sustained remission.&quot; In other words, only 3% of the patients who entered the trial remitted, and then stayed well and in the trial during the year-long followup.

But, as Pigott and his collaborators explain, even this number may be a bit high. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gary Greenberg did a podcast with Russ Roberts a few weeks ago. He made the same point about Kirsch as Alex, but went further. (From the transcript):

&quot;Basic point: efficacy of these pharmaceutical treatments of depression is that they are very unclear on depression, help some people but so do placebos; but they have this powerful effect that has nothing to do with depression that makes people like taking them. People [specifically, Kirsch] claim the studies showing the drugs don&#039;t really work means that the drugs don&#039;t do anything. The drugs do plenty, but there&#039;s no financial interest in figuring out what it actually is. In fact, there may be an anti-interest. If it only makes you feel more powerful then it&#039;s like Scotch; can&#039;t get your Medicare to cover it, or your employer. Argument for making Prozac over the counter, or making it illegal and let there be a black market for them.&quot;

He didn&#039;t address your point, though, Seth.

		<description><![CDATA[For those interested in the adverse effects of the SSRI drugs, see Joseph Glenmullen&#039;s Prozac Backlash (especially focused on involuntary tics caused by these drugs and the importance of withholding such drugs from patients with Parkinsons&#039;s) and Let Them Eat Prozac by David Healy (all about suicide and bizarre homicides in people who became suicidal or homicidal only on an SSRI drugs, and of course this comes to mind whenever a normal person shoots up a shopping mall or a classroom or an induction center. Healy is not exactly easy to read by has written extensively on the history of psychiatric drug development. 
As to &quot;long-term&quot; use, the suicides and homicides happen quite early on.

I find Whitaker very helpful in sorting out what is actually involved in assigning drug efficacy or lack of such. Physician critics of non-discriminant anti-psychotic and anti-depressant use, such as Peter Breggin, M.D., emphasize that the anti-psychotic drugs offer no efficacy advantage over simple sedatives but as associated with a myriad of adverse effects not caused by sedatives. 

Perhaps Dr. Roberts is familiar with the STAR-D trials.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I am happy that Kirsch has taken the time to compare antidepressants with placebos and non-treated controls. I would say the main problem with his work is that the studies he examines do a poor job of matching clinical practice, where non-working antidepressants are stopped and a new one tried. A comparison of placebo and the usual clinical practice hasn&#039;t been done. Such a trial is likely to show a larger effect of anti-depressants.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have not read &lt;i&gt;The Emperor&#039;s New Drugs&lt;/i&gt; (yet), but I&#039;m familiar with Kirsch&#039;s other published work.  The trouble with Kirsch is that he doesn&#039;t go nearly far enough.  His hypothesis is that antidepressant drugs are essentially glorified placebos.  That view is correct, as far as it goes, but Kirsch doesn&#039;t realize (or, at least, doesn&#039;t emphasize) the harmful effects of antidepressants, particularly when they are taken over the long term.
