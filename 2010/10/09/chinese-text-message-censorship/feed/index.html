		<description><![CDATA[Have you tried sending the message in an image if both phones are capable?
or using simple scrambling like writing backwards?
Just curious.
Anyway, I donÂ´t think it is good to draw attention.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the response.  

Although I&#039;m for open, transparent societies, I certainly have sympathy for Chinese government officials who feel cautious about enacting such liberalizations too quickly.  

It&#039;s too easy for Americans to criticize such policies thousands of miles away without being fully knowledgeable about the situation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No I don&#039;t have trouble accessing this site, although I would if it were hosted by blogspot. I use a VPN to get to other people&#039;s blogs in some cases. I use a VPN if I want to use Flickr or YouTube. I don&#039;t worry about being censored. 

I can get any site, but it is hard to watch videos. They come through so slowly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always wondered about the relationship of your blog with censorship (do you have trouble accessing your site, do you go through a 3rd party, do you feel hesitant about blogging on certain subjects in fear of obstruction, is it all overblown).]]></description>
