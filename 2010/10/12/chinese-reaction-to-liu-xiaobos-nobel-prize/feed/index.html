		<description><![CDATA[To add to Alrenous&#039; post - instead of &quot;anti war&quot; one acts &quot;pro peace&quot; for example for positive outcome. 

Even if it does not seem important at first sight, it makes a world of a difference, or better yet, a different world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Itâ€™s not necessarily rational or self-serving. &quot;

It&#039;s very rational if they value control more than wealth-from-productivity. 

Less rational in that it looks fear-dominated to me. It&#039;s not, &quot;Wow, telling people what to do is fun! Dance, minions, dance!&quot; It&#039;s more, &quot;Oh crap if they don&#039;t do what I tell them WE&quot;RE ALL GOING TO DIE.&quot; 

Or; the Chinese don&#039;t come down hard on dissidents because they&#039;re cruel jackasses. They come down hard on dissidents because they&#039;re terrified of what will happen if they don&#039;t. (Rightly or mistakenly.)

The holders of fear-dominated values tend to spend all their time warding off fearful situations, at the expense of looking for actual positive situations, and thus get stuck at suck no matter how skilled or powerful they are. But it&#039;s still the rational decision if the holder doesn&#039;t know any better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting this. I know, living in Israel, that the word on the street / local reality is often so different from what&#039;s reported abroad / foreign perceptions as to be unrecognizable, and that people just don&#039;t have a clear conception at all of what Israelis think about anything. So it&#039;s pretty interesting to see a sampling/snapshot of Chinese opinions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If they want to stick to a centrally-planned authoritarian system they might try letting people discuss, critique and have some input into decision-making without introducing democratic elections.  Most workplaces are dictatorships but the good ones have a light touch and consult staff at all levels.  It dosen&#039;t lead to disorder and revolution; it increases productivity and job-satisfaction.  But people who are authoritarian, I guess, prefer to objectify and control others.  It&#039;s not necessarily rational or self-serving.]]></description>
