		<description><![CDATA[There was a guy in the UK who ate nothing but mild cheddar cheese and had no major complications, just bouts of tiredness.  He started this diet (due to food-phobia) as a toddler and ended it aged 29, a strapping physically active guy.

		<description><![CDATA[Richard Cohen takes a dramatically different position,www.no milk.com 
He cites study after study implicating dairy in cancer, heart disease, degenerative diseases, etc. The &#039;milk letter&#039; by a physician at the top of his site is a bit long, but proposes that dairy can be the cause of everything from bovine leukemia in humans to arthritis, allergies and aneurisms.
I&#039;d be curious to see how the info and references with these two studes lines up above with the referenced material on www.nomilk.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I once went to a lecture by a nutritionist who extolled the virtues of this book:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/No-Dairy-Breast-Cancer-Prevention-Program/dp/0312291671&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The No-Dairy Breast Cancer Prevention Program: How One Scientist&#039;s Discovery Helped Her Defeat Her Cancer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The author, who is a prominent geologist in Britain, claims that dairy products contain growth factors that stimulate cancer growth.  I never read the book, but it sounded interesting at the time I attended the lecture a few years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Strangely enough, butter and cream are the only two dairy items that don&#039;t cause me some discomfort.  It must be the higher fat content.  Even yogurt/kefir, if I eat more than just a very small portion (and I mean a couple of tablespoons) has this effect on me.  Those touting raw dairy products claim that these don&#039;t cause similar lactose intolerance as pasteurized products.  That *MAY* be true for some people but not for me.

Anyway, like I said, I am able to digest butter just fine and have plenty of other sources of good saturated fats.  Ditto for probiotics.

In general I eat mostly saturated fats.  I do sometimes use olive oil and macadamia nut oil for cooking, as these are primarily monounsaturated fats.]]></description>
