		<description><![CDATA[Often, perhaps usually, a treatment will make some people better, do nothing for others, and make some people worse. 

When a treatment makes about as many people worse as it makes better, then meta-analysts say it doesn&#039;t work. 

But often it *does* work - for *some* people. Indeed, it might work very well indeed for them. 

The other people - for whom it makes no difference, or makes work - just need to stop using it - then everyone benefits. 

(It is just a matter of using patient response as a feedback loop.)

Is that really so difficult to understand? - yet I can never get this point across to bio-statisticians/ epidemiologists, meta-analysts and the like...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had back pain so bad I could barely walk.  I got Healing Back Pain by Dr. Robert Sarno.  I read it.  Pain went away.  

I gave it to my Brother.  He was going to have surgery.  After he read it, he feels so good, he is not having surgery.

I was at a motorcycle rally in 2009.  I met a guy from Texas who was miserable with back pain.  I told him about Dr. Sarno.  I ran into him again in 2010.  He was raving about how the book worked.  

Look, it may not be for you, but I know how my back feels and I know how it helped people who were going to get surgery and then felt good enough that it was no longer an option.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here are the results of my survey of people I know that have had the vertebrae fusion surgery. It has not relieved pain for anyone but did mean 6 months of additional suffering recovering from the surgery.

I will never have such surgery. I will go the back muscle strengthening route instead.]]></description>
