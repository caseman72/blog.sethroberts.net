		<description><![CDATA[Both those titles are terrible.

A decent title would be &quot;Violent video games can help parents bond with their children.&quot;

The title of anything on the web should be completely, utterly, boringly descriptive of the content, using the most ordinary language possible (&quot;children,&quot; not &quot;kids,&quot; for instance). On the web nobody wants to have cleverness or mystery meat up front. There&#039;s no time for that. If the title of the Google result or Google News result is not crystal clear and accurate, then bye-bye. It doesn&#039;t matter how clever you are if nobody reads you.

With video and audio it&#039;s even more important, because you cannot skim the content.

If you have your own blog and it&#039;s not a money-making venture, you can do whatever you want, I suppose. But if you&#039;re being paid for content, then the editor needs to see to it that interested readers can find your piece and recognize that it would be of interest to them.]]></description>
