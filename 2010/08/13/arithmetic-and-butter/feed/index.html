		<description><![CDATA[[...] Two years ago I discovered that butter — more precisely, substitution of butter for pork fat — made me faster. This raised the question: how much is best? For a long time I ate 60 g of butter (= 4 tablespoons = half a stick) per day. Was that optimal? I couldn’t easily eat more but I could easily eat less. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excuse the tangent, but I have a question that seems simple, but finding an answer is not.  I bought refrigerated flax oil about a year ago, and have kept it refrigerated since then.  I&#039;ve been lax about consuming it, but have lately started to eat it everyday.  I can understand how old oil would be less effective, but is it a total waste or harmful?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I see what you mean Seth.  

@ Alan: Braaains are delicious curried, though not so much on their own; too fatty; sop it up with bread, something like that; mix it with rice maybe.  Can have a metallic background taste that you might find offputting.  

They could probably use the bolt-headshot method while preserving most of the brain if they made sure to aim for the brain-stem - that&#039;s the quickest and surest kill anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The version of K2 in natto is M7.  M4 is the type animals produce when converting K1 to K2, meaning it&#039;s the type we seem to have evolved to optimally run on.  M7 in natto probably isn&#039;t equivalent to animal sourced M4.

That said, Allan&#039;s idea that it&#039;s the Valeric acid (6 carbon sat fat) sounds like a more promising theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Any chance you have fasting blood glucose levels for this period?  You posted recently about having levels in the prediabetic range that came down after starting daily walks...where does that experiment fit within this time frame?  The brain uses glucose rather exclusively for energy needs (unless you&#039;re starving then I think it can also use ketone bodies)...and glucose use goes up when the brain is working on problems.  So if more glucose was available, it would seem logical that your brain would think better.  And if your fasting glucose levels were up, your post-meal levels might have been alot higher as well...lots of potential computing power for the old noggin.   It would be interesting to see your math times for 4 conditions:  pork fat and old exercise regime; pork fat and walking; butter and old exercise regime; butter and walking.  And have glucose levels for the whole thing.

I&#039;m very insulin sensitive, and can run glucose levels in the low 40&#039;s.  I don&#039;t even try to do my taxes or balance my checkbook unless I&#039;ve eaten something.  I also participated in a diet study once where we had to decrease our daily total fat intake to 20% per day.  I couldn&#039;t do it.  I couldn&#039;t sleep; felt miserable and wired...plus ended up binging like crazy.  Then went to the weekly meeting and found out there were several others who had the same experiences.  Yet some people did it with no problem at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard that in Chinese medicine, if you have a problem with one organ, to eat that same organ from animals. So, the obvious food for better brain function is animal brains.  Cow brains provide DHA at 851 mg/ 100g and EPA at 374 mg/ 100g.  
http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beef-products/3461/2

(btw, Vitamin K2 is found in rat brains, and will likely be also found in cow brains if someone looks for it)

The problem with eating cow brains is that the FDA prohibits it because of the belief that it can transmit mad cow disease.  (There is a secondary problem in harvesting cow brains because the most humane method of slaughter is to shoot cows in the head, thus destroying the brain).  Mark Purdey, an example of an insider-outsider, believed that mad cow disease resulted from the UK&#039;s decide to order pesticides to be sprayed on cattle. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Purdey

So, if Purdey is correct, then the consumption of a healthy source of long chain omega 3 is prohibited by a false scientific theory.  

One hypothesis why butter might be helpful is that short chain saturated fats might be the cause.  Not many foods have butyric acid (4 carbon saturated fat) or valeric (6 carbon saturated fat) acid.  Wikipedia says valeric acid has a similar structure to neurotransmitter GABA.  You can test coconut oil to see if the cause is 8 to 12 carbon saturated fats because coconut oil and butter have them, while lard does not.  If coconut oil is unhelpful, then look at the 4 or 6 carbon fatty acids.

		<description><![CDATA[Caleb, it&#039;s Straus Creamery unsalted butter. That&#039;s an interesting idea about K2. I did not notice an improvement when I started eating natto, which is very high in K2. But I wasn&#039;t looking for one.

Tom, so far I&#039;ve only tried one brand of butter other than Straus. I didn&#039;t notice any big difference. However, it was a small test.

Riz Din, I haven&#039;t yet gone back to no butter, no. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not a learning effect. I&#039;ve seen thousands of learning curves. Not one showed a sudden improvement like this.]]></description>
