		<description><![CDATA[The NTI device is a type of night guard that is worn on the front teeth only. It was approved by the FDA in 2001 for migraine prevention.

I never had migraines but I purchased it because I wanted a hard plastic night guard that would leach less toxins. I have used it every night for over three years and don&#039;t even notice it.

		<description><![CDATA[Night guards don&#039;t prevent grinding, and they only barely protect your teeth. In addition, my experience says that wearing a night guard encourages stronger grinding (because it&#039;s less uncomfortable to grind), which would be even more true of the drug store variety (which are softer).
