		<description><![CDATA[You might want to get a test to determine the makeup of the LDL. You&#039;ll find out if it is the large, fluffy kind (good), or the small, dense kind (bad).

I would guess that with your diet, you would have a higher percentage of the large fluffy LDL. And that would be fine. The number itself, without knowing the different fractions, is meaningless if not misleading.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[wow, your HDL is incredibly low for someone on a high animal fat diet.  There are some people with low HDL though that are particularly protected from coronary disease:

A question also is did your lipids change appreciable in the time since your last heart scan?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, and you didn&#039;t get the LDL sub particle type measured. You&#039;ll probably find that the majority of LDL particles are the larger ones (the &quot;good&quot; &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol - ha!) And the formula used for calculating LDL doesn&#039;t work well when TRG is that low. How&#039;s it look with the Iranian forumla?

		<description><![CDATA[Your results are interesting because while animal fat will raise LDL it will (typically) raise HDL to protective levels. Ever think about getting your Omega-3s from fish oil as opposed to flaxseed or maybe try a combination of both to see if that might have the effect of raising your HDL?]]></description>
