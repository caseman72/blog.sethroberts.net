		<description><![CDATA[q, I started by tasting it. Lost 10 pounds. Then started gaining it back. Then switched to eating it noseclipped. Then started losing again. You won&#039;t notice the intelligence effects unless you carefully measure it, as I did. I wasn&#039;t terribly good at predicting how well I&#039;d do on the arithmetic test.

CTB, that&#039;s very interesting. The very low rate of Japanese heart disease has usually been attributed to lots of fish and low saturated fat. This study makes that explanation unlikely -- and therefore makes more likely an alternative explanation I like: the low rate of heart disease is due to all the fermented foods they eat (e.g., miso). The high rate of Japanese stroke has usually been attributed to a salty diet. This study suggests it&#039;s due to too-little saturated fat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All I can say is that the butter sold by Spring Hill at the Berkeley Farmers&#039; Markets is from pasture-fed cows in Petaluma -- and it is VERY TASTY. Spring Hill claims it does contain Weston Price&#039;s &quot;X-Factor,&quot; i.e. Vitamin K2.

I get myself in trouble (?) by leaving it on the kitchen counter to soften, right next to a container of crackers. No knife needed. Talk about instant gratificationâ€¦]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[do you eat the butter so that you taste it?   is it possible that some effects have to do with tasting it?

i&#039;ve been alternating between butter and canola and flax oil for a couple weeks for my SLD routine and find that butter is pretty effective and easier on my stomach than canola or flax.  but i haven&#039;t noticed any mood or intelligence effects, and my sleep is so variable (and has remained so) that i&#039;d have to chart it to be sure of anything.

flax oil has the problem that i can kinda sorta taste it even half an hour later, so i&#039;ll have to figure out how to do it right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,  why don&#039;t you try culturing your butter, if you haven&#039;t already.  Take some heavy cream, throw a dollop of yogurt in it and stir, wait overnight.  Then whisk the cream until it butters up.  Drain off the buttermilk (and drink!), then wash the butter in water to get rid of the excess buttermilk (or the butter will apparently go sour in a less than tasty way, but who knows).  It is very buttery, more so than uncultured sweet cream butter, and gives you saturated fat and more delicous lactobacilli.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of things.  The USDA recommends limiting sat fat to 10% of calories.  If you eat 2000 total calories per day, that would be 200 calories of sat fat.  there&#039;s 9 calories per gram of fat, so that would be 200/9 = 22 grams of sat fat.  So on average, the highest quintile was eating the USDA recommendation for sat fat.  

Which then makes you wonder how little fat the lowest quintile was eating.  Usually, foods with high saturated fat come from animal sources...which means they also contain significant cholesterol.  So the people in the lowest quintile were possibly eating no animal fat...maybe traditional lowfat Japanese food? with highly salted (preserved) fish?  and low amounts of cholesterol?   When Japanese switch from traditional diets to more Westernized food (in moderation), a lower risk of stroke has been noted in the past.  This has been attributed to the protective effect of adding a little more cholesterol to the diet and reducing salt.  

Cholesterol is crucial to the membrane stability of every cell in your body.  Increased salt intake is associated with increased blood pressure.  Increased pressure against weakened membranes on vascular cells can lead to rupture.  There&#039;s also concern that reducing cholesterol too low with statins can lead to increased stroke risk.

So perhaps the take home message from this study is that if you&#039;re eating a traditional Japanese diet, you can go ahead and add a cheeseburger every day for lunch.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had a pretty severe health disaster recently.

Malnutrition + anxiety -&gt; negative feedback loop that ended up causing serious damage. Overnight I went from being a lifelong near-narcoleptic to an insomniac. At one point I thought I was developing schizophrenia due to mild hallucinations (there&#039;s a correlation between malnutrition and the onset of psychopathology).

It&#039;s been several months and I feel like my brain is slowly improving. I can&#039;t sleep as well as I used to, but I can&#039;t complain either. One thing I&#039;m consciously doing is eating massive amounts of butter and high fat dairy products. Based on my day-to-day experience (e.g. some days of eating no butter, and having somewhat worse sleep the following night) I can&#039;t help but believe that saturated fat is playing a key role in short-term and long-term brain function.]]></description>
