		<description><![CDATA[G, that&#039;s a great story. As if the editor had had brain surgery that kept him from thinking useful thoughts. Since he ran an important paper, that&#039;s not trivial.

Perhaps some criticisms were not answered satisfactorily because there was no satisfactory answer. Or because the criticisms were unclear. To have a sensible idea on how to improve things I&#039;d want to look closely at what the problems were.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One time the editor of &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; came to my university to give a talk on the unhealthy relationship/symbiosis between politicians and the press.  

At the end he concluded that the press shouldn&#039;t suck up to politicians just so they get the stories first, and that politicans shouldn&#039;t manipulate the press so cynically; then the floor was opened for questions.  I asked him what &lt;i&gt;systemic&lt;/i&gt; changes would he recommend, rather than just telling people to &#039;be good&#039; at the end of a long cause-effect explanation of exactly why people aren&#039;t being good.  He irritably restated his conclusion then tried to turn the question around, asking what I would do (though I was able to give an opinion, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; was the expert, not me).  

Yes, the letters to the editor are better than nothing, just like the faltering professional-ethics-culture of journalists and politicians is better than nothing, but a better conclusion would have been: we should create a culture of &lt;i&gt;expectation&lt;/i&gt; that every convincing-sounding criticism should be answered satisfactorily.  

Doesn&#039;t have to be 100% - people have lives to live; fall and break their ankle, feel to hungover to answer letters, etc - but there should be some stigma attached to ducking hard questions.]]></description>
