		<description><![CDATA[Seth, thanks for the pointer.  There is a real issue in many disciplines that emphasize that teaching really is not as important as other things -- even though, in theory, the teachers/professors are being hired to teach (from the public perspective) ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a psychologist who teaches, and I have encouraged almost all my students to experiment on themselves, given that its the easiest way to get data.

That being said, i dont know if its part of the formal curriculum anywhere.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love specific and concrete (low status?) advice like what is in this book.  I am considering ordering it even though I don&#039;t do any in-classroom teaching just because I love reading about techniques like this.

I find it is MUCH easier for me to think up or understand general principles when given a set of great concrete tips than it is for me to generate great concrete tips from a set of abstract principles.  I suspect this is the same for everyone, which makes me think that concrete tips should be valued MUCH higher than anything abstract!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are a lot of classes on &quot;how to pass papers around.&quot; They are called Classroom Management and taught by Curriculum and Instruction departments. People who study education theory are in Education departments. The two departments (or, in smaller institutions, parts of the same department by whatever name) typically don&#039;t talk to one another much, nor do they communicate with the corresponding Subject Area departments. So, for example, a future math teacher may learn classroom management from one professor, education theory from another, and math from the third - with the three professors belonging to three different departments. This makes little practical sense, because in real classroom, these &quot;parts&quot; aren&#039;t separable at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s not true.  

I recall reading Susan Ohanian (a great teacher and writer) writing in one of her wonderful books that the only thing of actual usefulness that she learned in the teacher-ed classes she was required to take for certification was a technique for handing out papers efficiently!
