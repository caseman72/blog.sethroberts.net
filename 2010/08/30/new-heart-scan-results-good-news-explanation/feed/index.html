		<description><![CDATA[I have tripped over your blog while researching flaxseed.  At the expense of sounding COMPLETELY stupid... I admit, I have no idea what I am reading, as the science is all greek to me.  BUT, I am seeing key words that resonate with the path I am on.  I am seeing a Dr. in Mesquite, TX who did some pretty unorthodox testing but was able to get to the bottom of my symptoms.  Too many to go into, and too many diagnosis to list here as well, but I originally saw him for RA symptoms and reflux like symptoms.  He requested blood work.  The results you are so painfully stumbling upon seem to jive with what he rambled in scientific terms.  I have only seen him once and I am on heavy duty regimen of vitamins and plan on talking to him more specifically as I slowly digest what my body is experiencing.  I am writing because I wanted to recommend 2 books, Nourishing Traditions and The Maker&#039;s Diet.  Both have VERY controversial and interesting information about our food sources and the testimony in Maker&#039;s Diet was amazing.  Dr.&#039;s CLEARLY are only in the business of masking symptoms.  The doctor I am seeing was able to give me REAL answers.  While he is an MD and a PhD, all his schooling was done out of the country and he has received amnesty to treat in the states (not clear about that process), but I know he is highly controversial as the last person he tried to train in his methods was shot in the back of the head.  How&#039;s that for modern medicine!!!  One thing I do see is that every &quot;new theory&quot; is touted as the end all be all, and for real, we are all individuals with very complex bodies and very different combining systems.  Just because something is a &quot;natural&quot; supplement, doesn&#039;t mean it is good for you and certainly not in mega doses!  I am getting quite an education and I am just beginning.  I may start a blog of my own, people need to feel that there is hope amidst the wolves of medicine.  Basics, raw, raw, raw as often as you can from a reputable source/dairy.  No white flour or sugar.  Some may not even be able to tolerate honey etc. or wheat.  Pork fat and butter, brilliant!!  Nourishing Traditions does a whole thing on fats and you are SPOT on.  I&#039;ve written so much, but I just wanted to put it out there to the stratosphere that what you are doing is commendable and I encourage you to cross reference your sources with other sources and don&#039;t ever believe everything you read from a medical journal, find out who is funding them, it just may be a corn oil manufacturer!!!]]></description>
