		<description><![CDATA[Have always liked to pace up and down when thinking - I think this is a more natural, varied way to body-think (sometimes, when no one is looking, I sort of dance), but I suppose an office environment has to be more controlled and one has to be near one&#039;s working materials, keyboard etc.  

In &#039;The Grapes of Wrath&#039; the farmers always squat down together and doodle in the dust with sticks when having a confab.  I think if you are forced to think while stock still and suppressing the body you might get more rigid and dumb over time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, it seems well written. However, I would not describe it as &quot;debunking&quot;.

From the paper: 

&quot;Natural climate variability is not well understood and is probably quite
large. It is not clear that the proxies currently used to predict temperature
are even predictive of it at the scale of several decades let alone over many
centuries. Nonetheless, paleoclimatoligical reconstructions constitute only
one source of evidence in the AGW debate.

Our work stands entirely on the shoulders of those environmental scientists
who labored untold years to assemble the vast network of natural
proxies. Although we assume the reliability of their data for our purposes
here, there still remains a considerable number of outstanding questions
that can only be answered with a free and open inquiry and a great deal of
replication.&quot;]]></description>
