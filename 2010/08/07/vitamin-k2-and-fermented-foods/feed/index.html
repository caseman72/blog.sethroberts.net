		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t know that. Thanks for pointing that out. I found the following in the article you linked to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Future research will have to clarify whether the vitamin K2 synthesized by animal tissues and by bacteria are interchangeable, whether one is superior to the other, or whether each presents its own unique value to our health.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Japanese liver-cancer study I describe doesn&#039;t make clear what sort of K2 they used. The article says: &quot;The treatment group received 45 mg/d of vitamin K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Glakay, Eisai Co, Tokyo, Japan).&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

You realize that bacteria fermented K2 (natto, sauerkraut, cheese) is generally of the MK-7 variety, while K2 found in animal products such as liver and butter is of the MK-4 variety. 
http://www.westonaprice.org/abcs-of-nutrition/175-x-factor-is-vitamin-k2.html#fig4
The effects are probably similar, but studies done on MK-4 don&#039;t necessarily provide evidence for consumption of fermented food.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vic, the one-tailed p value for the liver-cancer result  is 0.02. From which I conclude that the reduction is unlikely to be bogus (it&#039;s unlikely that the two groups were the same) but could easily be a lot less than 90%.]]></description>
