		<description><![CDATA[bjk: Sorry, what planet are you writing from?

Read Atul Gawande&#039;s &quot;The Checklist Manifesto&quot; to get a real sense of many of the systemic problems in Amerian medicine, and the challenges real physicians face.  The problems are not that physicians don&#039;t know or care much, it&#039;s that knowing and caring way more than you do are nowhere near enough to overcome the problems, which are many, varied, deep and, frankly, terrifying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The &quot;further research is needed&quot; phrase irks me, too. I try to avoid it in my scientific publications, though sometimes a statement like it is needed to convey how preliminary a conclusion may be given a limited data set. It is probably more accurate and genuine to point out when an important, perhaps fundamental issue has so far received scant (inappropriately insufficient) attention. Seth and I have said something to this effect in our publications on behavioral variability.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s right, Dennis. The usual paper published in a scientific journal answers all the questions in its field of study, but its authors routinely denigrate their own work by dishonestly suggesting that the field needs further study. They do that because suggesting your work is lower quality than it actually is happens to be a brilliant carreer strategy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some other possible reasons for Venter&#039;s success might come from relatively unique attributes vis a vis other contemporary scientists (from his autobiography):

&quot;Of all my memories, the most vivid is my total and absolute freedom. [...] During my childhood in California, my parents simply told me to &quot;go play.&quot; Given this heady license, I discovered that I loved taking risks and facing challenges - a side of me that I have not yet outgrown.&quot; (p.5)

&quot;Every day of my childhood was a day of play and exploration that had a bigger impact on my development than anything I was taught in school [...] I think that one reason I was able to become a successful scientist was that my natural curiosity was not driven out of me by the education system.&quot; (p.7 - Venter says he was not very engaged in schooling, and often received poor grades)

&quot;I can also recall only too well how my folks constantly rewarded my better-behaved older brother, a mathematical prodigy. I, on the other hand, was threatened with visits to the juvenile detention home to scare me into better behavior.&quot; (p.9)

Venter likes taking risks and isn&#039;t too interested in what other scientists think. He also had an unconventional education (when he graduated from high-school, he didn&#039;t go to university, he went surfing, and so on).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Medical&#039; researchers aren&#039;t even *trying* to make people better; they are trying to get funding. 

Most know nothing about medicine, even from their personal experience (because they are young and healthy) - and, BS aside, couldn&#039;t care less about medicine, only &#039;models&#039; of disease. 

They want to, need to, impress the big names in their field - the people who decide who gets published, gets grants, gets jobs, promotions and prizes; but why should they want to impress sick people, or make their lives better? Where&#039;s the career advancement in that? 

Indeed medical researchers typically have no involvement with sick people in any way (except, maybe, to use them as experimental animals).]]></description>
