&quot;Our hypothesis is that fats themselves play a role in regulating sleep,&quot; Shaw said. They are, after all, signaling molecules, he said, and it&#039;s possible &quot;that lipids themselves are somehow signaling to the brain that you should be sleepy or are initiating cascades that either result in impairment or can protect you from impairment.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

What is commonly tested as LDL is not the whole story.  Have a look at &quot;cholesterol subfractions&quot;  Not all LDL is the same.  There is small and dense, and large and fluffy.  One &quot;good&quot; one &quot;bad&quot;...  Admittedly I have a layman&#039;s (caveman&#039;s?) understanding of all this but you might be able to better digest it... 

There are enough studies out there to seriously doubt the medical establishment&#039;s fascination with Statins...   

Just to put my biases out there, I have been following a LowCarb-&gt; Paleo-&gt; EvFit lifestyle for over two years now and have lost weight (320-&gt;240 lbs) as well as improving my overall fitness...

PaNu Blog is excellent on this:

		<description><![CDATA[Did I simply add the fat to my diet or eat less of something else? I ate less of everything else. Butter is not all fat; 60 g of butter is about 500 calories.

I already ate low-carb. The rest of my diet is meat, vegetables, and fermented foods, such as kombucha and yogurt. I eat one normal meal per day. I walk hard uphill on a treadmill a few times/week. 

Perhaps I lost 7 pounds between the two scans. I&#039;m not sure, but weight loss alone can&#039;t produce such a change, in the sense that I can&#039;t imagine a plausible connection.  I don&#039;t know the test-retest correlation but the fact that a decrease is so rare shows that this cannot be due to chance. My sleep has been good for a long time. I doubt sleep changes had anything to do with it.

I haven&#039;t heard of the brachial artery tourniquet test. Butter seems to have reduced my blood pressure, which argues against increasing stiffness.

K, can you point me to an example of this in the paleo forums? My impression is that people sometimes improve, but inevitably they have made many changes.  To make just one change as I did is very rare, as far as I can tell.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, have you ever heard of the brachial artery tourniquet test?  It&#039;s supposed to test the health of your arteries.  I once heard a lecture by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heartattackproof.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist who advocates an extremely low-fat diet as a means to prevent or treat heart disease.  Esselstyn uses the results of the tourniquet test as evidence that ingesting even modest amounts of lipids can make your arteries &quot;stiffer&quot; (i.e., less able to dilate after being constricted).  I remember that Esselstyn made a big deal out of it during his lecture.]]></description>

I am unsurprised by your result. If you hang out in the paleo/low carb forums, you see this kind of thing a lot. And let&#039;s not forget that the greatest (and most vilified) proponent of animal fat, the late Dr. Atkins, was a cardiologist.

By the way, I am curious. Do you eat low(ish) carb?]]></description>
