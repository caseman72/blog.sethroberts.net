		<description><![CDATA[Do you routinely take Vitamin K2, or any vitamin supplements? 

I agree with Jen - vitamins naturally come packaged with necessary things to absorb them (ie fat). Seems to me the focus should be on eating whole foods that contain the vitamins we need, rather than isolating vitamins individually (an unnatural state) and trying to find ways for the body to absorb them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fat-soluble micronutrients such as vitamin K are absorbed to a much greater extent when they are consumed with fat. Most meals contain some fat. This may explain the result.

Nature conveniently packages its K2 MK-4 along with plenty of fat. Foods rich in MK-4 include grass-fed butter, egg yolks, liver, other organ meats, etc.]]></description>
