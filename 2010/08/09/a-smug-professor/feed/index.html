		<description><![CDATA[Book sales and name recognition tell us nothing about the relative merits of the positions taken by the prof and Tucker. They tell us something about the relative popularity. Which is about as meaningless as it is possible to get. Or should we assume The China Study is right and Denise Minger&#039;s criticisms are inaccurate because she isn&#039;t as well known as Campbell? And Gary Taubes should shut up because Dean Ornish has sold more books? Perhaps you could add that Tucker has a law degree as a measurable result -- and he went to Duke too.

All of which is beside the real point -- the author was making casual fun of the generation gap, and the critique is misplaced.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Phil, thanks for explaining that. I read it differently: she really does wonder what it means that even the smart ones like a book she considers stupid. It vaguely resembles a Polish joke, I suppose, with I Hope They . . . in the place of the Polish people.

John, to say &quot;I cannot possibly be a mentor to someone who reads and enjoys Dan Brown novels&quot; strikes me as humorous. You seem to be making fun of your dislike of Dan Brown. Whereas to say &quot;I&#039;m amazed that even some of our smart employees like Dan Brown&quot; doesn&#039;t strike me as humorous at all. If she had used a smiley face after her sentence I would agree you, however. For example, &quot;I&#039;m amazed that even some of our smart employees like Dan Brown :)&quot; comes across much differently than the sentence with no smiley face.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you asked Barreca if she has actually read 1%+ of Tucker&#039;s book?

Have you asked for a comment or clarification?

Publicly labelling her as obstinate and stubborn in her worldview without finding out her point-of-view seems like quite a jump and one hell of an assumption.

Given that she is a &#039;humourist&#039;, there&#039;s also the chance that she was making light of the age gap with a facetious remarkâ€”exactly how I did yesterday when I said that I cannot possibly be a mentor to someone who reads and enjoys Dan Brown novels.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with MT on this.  Did you not understand that Barecca was _joking_?

Hey, and you know what?  I didn&#039;t like the movie Dumb and Dumber...I guess that makes me a bad person, right?  Obviously I&#039;m a snob, only an elitist snob would dislike Dumb and Dumber; after all, it was a very popular movie.  Any time a well-educated person expresses dislike or disdain for something popular, it&#039;s because they&#039;re a snob.  What other reason could there possibly be?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MT, one measurable result is book sales. Another is name recognition.

Nancy, thanks for pointing that out.

B Riley, yes, that is a fair criticism. She does muse about the popularity rather than take it as an example of the world going to hell. As you say, one of several possible explanations is that she is considering the possibility that she is wrong. I think it&#039;s far more likely that she has made up her mind about the book (which she hasn&#039;t read) and now is deciding what it means that &quot;even&quot; &quot;smart&quot; students like it. It is a harsh judgment on X to wonder why &quot;even some smart people&quot; like X. And if X is a book you haven&#039;t read, there is a lot of &quot;I must be right&quot; involved, even if it doesn&#039;t rise to absolute certainty.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You two jump to conclusions as quickly as the prof you criticize! 

She clearly has an initial dislike of Max&#039;s book, but there are multiple implications of her students liking it even though she doesn&#039;t. These range from her students being stupid, her students being unexposed to better material though smart, or that she is passing up something good because of a knee-jerk reaction. If that sentence can plausibly be read as her pondering whether she is wrong, you can&#039;t say that thought isn&#039;t &quot;even in the realm of possibility&quot;.]]></description>
