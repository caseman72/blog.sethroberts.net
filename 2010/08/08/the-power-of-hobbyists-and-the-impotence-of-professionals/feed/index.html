		<description><![CDATA[thanks, disgruntledphd. I&#039;ve heard lots of complaints from scientists about the need for constant grant writing -- as you say, three per day on ScienceBlogs -- but I&#039;ve never heard any of the complainants say how much it had inhibited their work. Maybe I&#039;m not reading ScienceBlogs carefully enough. If you know of any examples, I&#039;d be grateful if you&#039;d point me to one because it&#039;s highly relevant to my work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey man, like the blog and the major theme of your post.

However, scientists complain constantly about the grant treadmill, read any blog over at science blogs or scientopia and you&#039;ll find at least three per day.

That being said, its normally people who are new to a field who come up with the revolutionary theories, so i do see where you are coming from there.

Keep up the good work.]]></description>
