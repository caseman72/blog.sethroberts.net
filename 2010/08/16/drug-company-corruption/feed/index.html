		<description><![CDATA[Imagine the anger and harsh penalties if a non-professional individual were to directly cause just one boy to grow breasts.  Whether motivated by greed or neglect, it would be a mass media horror-story and there&#039;d be an expectation of a prison-sentence.  A doctor who was irrefutably found to do this for knowingly dishonest motives would be struck off; drug-companies have no analogous punishment: they are never dissolved, taken over by the state; the bosses are not personally punished - they are not prevented from doing similar things again.]]></description>

Isn&#039;t one of your bugaboos the fact that large institutions like the FDA are too slow at recognizing new data, and have outdated recommendations that clever researchers should question?
