		<description><![CDATA[Great information. It`always good to know that there is some new alternative remedy for asthma. Is there any web site where we can purchase “bacillus coagulans”. I would also suggest you to try Buteyko Breathing Technique. The approach takes its name from the past Ukrainian doctor Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko. Many of the studies showed patients who used the Buteyko method experienced a reduction in the symptoms of their asthma and many of the patients also were able to reduce their use of inhalers by two uses a day after using the method for six months.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Richard,

That&#039;s interesting, but definitely does not apply to me.  I have some allergic asthma along with exercise induced asthma.  I can crank out 50 sit ups or 15 toe to bars without breaking a sweat.  My abdominal muscles are strong yet I still have asthma.  

I do have some success damping down asthma if I try to keep my lungs empty until I have to breath.  At that point, I breath in from the bottom of my lungs up (i.e. using the abdomen to pull the air in).  This helps when sitting idle, but is of no help during Crossfit-type strenuous activity.

		<description><![CDATA[A relevant but strangely ignored or not generally known fact about asthma and breathing troubles is that the change between weak (asthmatic) and strong (healthy) breathing is dependent on abdominal muscle tension.  Slackening the muscles here causes abysmally weak and asthmatic breathing.  Training the muscles, for example by â€œabdominal hollowingâ€ (see Web articles) produces an antiasthmatic  effect.  Abdominal muscle tension plays a prominent part in Asian martial arts.  

I tend to breathe asthmatically after an evening meal or in pollen-laden air.
So it is fair to assume that there is a natural breathing spectrum with an asthmatic tendency at one end and Ku Fu or Karate breathing at the other end. For a few words on the Japanese version of Asian breathing see http://www.lrz.de/~s3e0101/webserver/webdata/OBT.pdf
  Breathing powerfully into my lower abdomen with tensed muscles provides an effective cure for me.  But then Iâ€™ve always been sceptical about medical wisdom on asthma: such a paradoxical and doctor-baffling increase in the last 40 years with modern, merely symptomatic inhalers.  Respectfully, Richard Friedel]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aleksandar, I&#039;m currently using Source Naturals Dura Flora.  Thorne Research&#039;s Lacto bacillus Sporogenes (the old name for this probiotic which is now called Bacillus Coagulans) also has it.  And, there are a few others which have Bacillus Coagulans/Lactobacillus Sporogenes as well.   

Seth, yeah, that&#039;s what I figured.  I&#039;m excited that this probiotic has done so much for me, but I&#039;ll be even more excited if my body can heal to the point where I don&#039;t need as much of it.

I&#039;m currently taking 10 Billion CFU&#039;s of the Bacillus Coagulans because the Autumn is my worst time of year.  So far, I only have to hit the rescue inhaler about one out of every three workouts (and only one time).  I&#039;m still on my nightly steroid inhaler which I used to take twice a day.I did go off the steroid inhaler for one of my three 14 day tests, and I did notice some difference being completely off of it.  I&#039;ll see how I progress this Fall.  I might go off it before the Fall ends depending on how this treatment progresses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I stumbled upon your blog earlier this year. It held my interest, I&#039;ve always been attracted to alternatives. This is the first post where I&#039;d like to try out your suggestion, but I could not find &quot;bacillus coagulans&quot; at Whole Foods. Any suggestions on where can I order it from?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JohnG, it&#039;s a genetic problem that only becomes visible in a bad environment. Like Aaron Blaisdell&#039;s sun sensitivity.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve tried the apples, jicama root, fos, etc to no success.  I do juice carrots twice a week and don&#039;t wash them.  We have a garden and don&#039;t wash the vegetables well either for the same reason.

I agree with David&#039;s complexity idea.  The bacillus coagulans is clearly a band aid of sorts; performing a needed function somehow missing in me currently.    

What really throws a wrench in the works is the fact that my Dad and one of my sons both have the same problem; and my other son has atopic dermatitis.  So, clearly, there&#039;s a genetic component.  Now, is that a genetic component that manifests itself via an incorrect diet or just a different environment than we were adapted for.  Or, what if the genetic problem is just that; a malfunction which persists with the aid of antibiotics to keep us alive long enough each generation to pass it along.

Lots of variables to bewilder the mind.  That&#039;s why I really get excited when something works like this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The detailed ecology of the gastrointestinal tract is poorly known, to say the least.  Maybe 1% of the intestinal organisms have even been identified. Seeing results where a single probiotic addition improves a symptom in an obvious way may give the false idea the system is simpler than it actually it.  It should not be surprising that the positive effect does not last without continuing intake because of the unlimited complexity of the internal ecology and unknown players involved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, it appears from the probiotics books that I have read that you will need supplementation in the long term if you want a particular, commercial probiotic as non-native bacteria don&#039;t permanently colonize the gut.  You get the mix early in life from family and early environmental exposure.  

Another point is that in a more bacteria-rich environment, you wouldn&#039;t need to seek out commercial bacteria to ingest--they would be present in larger numbers in your food.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good point Aaron.  I&#039;ve considered the same thing.  I&#039;m hoping that, over time, on a paleo-like diet while taking the bacillus coagulans my body will heal itself, but I&#039;m just not sure that&#039;s how it works. 

Here&#039;s two points that oppose that thought which I&#039;ve considered thus far.  

One, because of my diet, other environmental exposures, or just something genetically fouled up in my system, I may never get better and need a probiotic of some kind for the rest of my life; ala prescription medicines.  

Two, perhaps we were meant to have some level of exposure (load) to these agents (soil organisms, etc), and maybe some people require more because of genetics.  

I&#039;m currently leaning to believe it is some combination of the two.  

As a side note, I also had mild colitis for about 15 years which has not returned since I&#039;ve begun the treatment.]]></description>
