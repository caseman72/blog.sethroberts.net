		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Because I eat lots of butter, flaxseed oil, and yogurt, I eat only one normal meal per day.&quot;

Interesting.  I&#039;m going to try amping up my butter + omega 3 oil consumption and similarly try 1 meal/day.  (When I don&#039;t eat enough butter or fish/coconut oil, I get hungry for extra meals and/or get carb cravings.)

Seth, one question...are you finding that taking that much oil is resulting in &#039;intestinal difficulties&#039;?  (If I take more than 1 T fish oil I am likely to need to race to the bathroom at some point the following day.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The &quot;Israeli Paradox&quot; is no paradox at all - it&#039;s simply more evidence that a low-fat diet high in vegetable derived PUFAs is unhealthy.

To those of us who generally follow the opposite of the food pyramid and who consume plenty of natural saturated fat from grass-fed beef and fish with excellent 03-06 ratios,  recommendations from the American Heart Association or the USDA are irrelevant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Annie, you should read the article :P

It appears Allport keeps her omegas balanced by using
- flax, walnuts and canola
and NOT using
- peanut butter, soy oil, corn oil

There are other ways to balance, but for a vegan her approach is perfect...except it relies on ALA for omega-3. Now that they have vegan supplements of DHA, which is the form immediately usable by the human body...I suggest those.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth - What are foods that are typically high in Omega 6?  I&#039;m a vegan and have a feeling that this diet naturally keeps Omega 6 levels low anyways.  

Put differently, what are foods that are high in Omega 3s, but not high in Omega 6s?  Flax oil is one, I&#039;m assuming.]]></description>
