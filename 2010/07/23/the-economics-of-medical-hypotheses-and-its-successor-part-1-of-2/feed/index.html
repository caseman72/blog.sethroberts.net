		<description><![CDATA[In response to the sacking of Dr. Charlton I have decided not to renew my subscription to Medical Hypotheses or its successor. I would hope others would do likewise. 

AIDS and its &quot;cause&quot; are not the only important medical topics to be willfully  distorted for the sake of political gain. About 46% of physicians in the US now are employees, rather than being self-employed. I believe this makes them bureaucrats and as such their first loyalty is to their employer, the bureau. Any loyalty or commitment they may have to their patient takes a second seat to their alliance with their employer.
I have found Paul Berman, Shelby Steele and Thomas Sowell most helpful in my attempt to understand these very bad behaviors on the parts of intellectuals and bureaucrats. Insofar as one&#039;s best effort to sort out what is good science-based medical treatment clashes with that of the bureau, one tends to keep quiet lest one become its next target.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not sure.  If &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot; had the possibility of hurting the reputation of other Elsevier publications, it may make financial sense to drop &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot; even if it is making money.  Especially if they can find some less controversial magazine to put into its â€˜bundlesâ€™.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[elseviers has now built a  digital network that controls over 800 of the most important medical journals, both at the submission end and at the online access end.
we should be asking ourselves who is elseviers? and what are their interests
i suspect it is not a moral issue but a commercial issue
curiously, the previous ceo of elseviers was also a paid director of GSK]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stephen, what you wrote reminds me of Adam Curtis&#039;s excellent documentary series The Mayfair Set.  I am forever trying to get people to watch his work; I think it&#039;s important.  It happens that I pasted all of episode two into the following blog-post, but I would rather you watched it from the beginning; episode one is easy to find with a Google video-search.

		<description><![CDATA[What this reminds me of is a book I read in the late 70s about young millionaires.  The profiles had a very large number of people who had been working on masters in business or economics and had stumbled on the fact that many business had parts there were worth more than the total value of the business itself.

You could thus buy the business, break it up and sell the parts and make a substantial profit. All of this occurs because the people running the business and the owners (stockholders) have divergent interests.  Most of them were flunked for writing thesis with this as the topic -- their professors were certain that such a condition could never occur.

What the profs missed was that these guys were the market forces that created a correction.  Then, in the 90s, the trend began of people who sucked the revenue out of businesses, not in diversions (such as the ones evident here) but in excess ceo, etc. pay.  Again, capture at work.  In many of those cases you can make a business substantially more profitable by taking it over, firing the management team and replacing them with one that costs millions of dollars less.

But capture, in all of its forms, is fascinating to watch.  Sad in Charlton&#039;s case as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;My understanding is that senior managers (in the private and public sector) are â€˜usingâ€™ - even exploiting - their organizationâ€™s resources in pursuing personal goals - engaging in a kind of moral grandstanding, in making large gestures which show how â€˜ethicalâ€™ they are in their views - at everyone elseâ€™s expense.&quot;

I&#039;m far from anti-union, but I do see this type of behaviour among militant union leaders (even low-level leaders) who just want to be seen to be championing a cause, usually at the expense of union members.  It is another case of moral vanity trumping profit or even careerism.  

Happens that I posted recently about anger towards AIDS denialists.  I read Kary Mullis&#039;s account and it seemed like there were questions to be asked, to say the least.  It is funny/maddening to see &#039;liberal&#039; people try to suppress debate, because these same people condemn censorship in virtually every other context.  I suppose I say this because AIDS, like climate-change, is a perennial concern of educated liberals.  

You ever read cracked.com?  They ran an article that listed Mullis as one of a number of &#039;clearly insane&#039; Nobel winners, along with Brian Josephson, who studies ESP.  I couldn&#039;t believe my eyes!  You become a &lt;i&gt;household-name&lt;/i&gt; nutcase for holding an unorthodox scientific opinion?  It&#039;s not like he said AIDS was created by the Masons or anything...]]></description>
