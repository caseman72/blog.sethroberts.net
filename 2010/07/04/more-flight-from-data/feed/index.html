		<description><![CDATA[I hope that Rogoff is as critical of the IMF during his tenure -- at the time, to work there you needed to have a PhD in economics by the age of 32, plus related work experience. So basically, people who prioritized academics and also excelled at them. Did the resulting homogeneity in thinking produce good policy? Would it create rich debate and dialogue in the institution? Or did it allow delusion to persist indefinitely?I don&#039;t know what their hiring policies are like now, but fear massive, ossified bureaucracies like the IMF lack incentives to improve. The people in the insitution who could make the decision to change hiring policy were hired for their supposed superiority based on their academic history. For them to change the hiring policy would be like admitting the emperor had no clothes -- academic success is not equivalent to being able to provide real-world value.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;conversely useless economics is completely disconnected from anything to do with economics: itâ€™s pure mathematical games.&quot;

I don&#039;t know about that.  Microeconomics is, IMHO, a very important subject that should be required in high school and college.  

It&#039;s ridiculous how little most Americans know about finance.  I think part of that comes from not being taught microeconomics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The difference between useless economics (i.e., all economic research that comes out of academia) and useless biology is that useless biology is practically useless, but it at least reveals some underlying truth about biology; conversely useless economics is completely disconnected from anything to do with economics: it&#039;s pure mathematical games.]]></description>
