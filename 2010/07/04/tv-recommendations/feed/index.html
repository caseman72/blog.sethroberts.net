So watching TV must provide some sort of psychological benefit to a lot of people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting - I use audiobooks and music when I exercise.

Anecdotally, I&#039;ve found TV watching to make me feel less motivated, and I know others who find the same - and I&#039;m talking about carefully selected advert-free TV - not just random channel surfing.  I&#039;ve personally considered experimenting, but don&#039;t yet have the tools - and now, I don&#039;t want to sacrifice my motivation to the experiment!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ordinary TV watching, no. In the 1960s a survey suggested that Americans stay up an hour later than people in other countries because they watch TV an hour later. After I read that I stopped watching the late night news. 

It&#039;s an interesting question what effect it has on my mental performance but I don&#039;t know the answer. 

Mainly I watch TV to make exercise more bearable.]]></description>

I&#039;m curious - have you ever done any experiments to see how TV watching affects your mood, sleep, or cognitive performance?]]></description>
