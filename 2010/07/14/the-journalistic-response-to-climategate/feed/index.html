		<description><![CDATA[This is laughable - you should bring a better class of debate around here.  You made up a lot of crap that had nothing to do with my point - does that phrasing suit you better than &#039;straw man&#039;?  Cos either way, it&#039;s what you did buddy.  

If you disagree, make a real point and demonstrate it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[G: You seem to be saying that because we have lots of potential sources of worldwide disaster (and I can list many of them: overfishing, over-fertilizing, oversubscription to fresh water sources, pollution, peak oil, peak phosphates, deforestation, antibiotic-resistant disease bacteria, mono-cropping... I could go on) we should ignore the biggest one.  The same argument applies to each of the others, with the result being that we must ignore them all.  This argument is appealing to people who are doing well now at the expense of those already affected, but it&#039;s ultimately both selfish and disastrous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This narrow focus on CO2 is like a cosmic joke.&quot; I agree. Overdependence on a single resource has been a recipe for disaster for a long time. In the past, it&#039;s been manufacturers who&#039;ve made that mistake -- e.g., Manchester textile factories. Now thinkers have managed to make the same mistake, saying that we can solve overdependence on one thing (fossil fuels) by  . . . doing one thing (reducing CO2). It&#039;s like this: &quot;Yur litter to me cantained meny mispillings&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The main measurements used all differ from each other hugely&quot;

 - though they can be said to very broadly mirror each other as far as overall trends are concerned.  

Also: 

Yes, sudden changes can overwhelm a system; I see that - not that that relatively nuanced point is what generally comes across in the media (more carbon = bad).  

But still, even if this is right, why only focus on CO2?  It&#039;s not a robust strategy.  Way we&#039;re going, we avert one catastrophe and stumble into another.  It&#039;s not good enough.  We&#039;re like a dysfunctional family trying to solve our problems with a trip to Disneyland.  It won&#039;t do any harm, but it&#039;s not going to address the root of the problem.  

The root of the problem is that we are idiots almost to a man.  Our culture is selfish and venal.  People don&#039;t want to leave a light footprint because they are greedy.  They&#039;d rather believe that somebody else can redesign hummers to run on clean fuels and go on driving to the recycling place to make a token gesture once a week.  

Things need re-thought from the ground up.  Superficial measures help to defer that junkie&#039;s rock-bottom realisation.  You need to know how wrong you are to get right.  But the climate-change people think they have all the answers - they are so self-righteous.  Even if they&#039;re right about the science, they&#039;re really wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please try to understand the distinction between absolute level of CO2 and the rate of change of CO2.  Life can adapt to any level of CO2 if it gets there slowly enough.  Too fast, and you get mass extinctions, ecological disruptions, agricultural crises, pervasive changes in rainfall patterns, famine, and world war (in that order).  Previous large changes in CO2 level that did not result in mass extinctions happened over thousands of years.  Those that happened fast show up as mass extinctions in the fossil record, and serve as boundaries between named geological periods.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This narrow focus on CO2 is like a cosmic joke.  We&#039;ve got a runaway high-consumption culture that flies in the face of thermodynamics; no hi-tech energy solution guaranteed to be just around the corner; we can&#039;t countenance any measure that impacts economic &#039;growth&#039; unless it&#039;s the growth of some other country; we aren&#039;t recycling or taking proper care with how we dispose of toxic waste - I mean, you have to mind how much fish you eat cos of the mercury for god&#039;s sake; we aren&#039;t about to go extract minerals from space anytime soon, etc, etc...  

All this, and we are stopping the presses for CO2.  Which, I gather, was present in several times the concentration during the Jurassic era, when Earth supported lush rainforests and massive dinosaurs.  

Why don&#039;t we just take robust measures and leave a smaller footprint &lt;i&gt;in general&lt;/i&gt; instead of prioritizing carbon to the near-exclusion of other environmental issues?  I&#039;ll tell you why: because it requires bigger sacrifice, more thought, and it pisses off more powerful people with a big stake in how things are done just now.  You can maybe convince China to make token reductions in CO2 but you can&#039;t convince them not to want to live in tower-blocks and drive everywhere in hummers.  

This CO2 stuff is a distraction &lt;i&gt;even if&lt;/i&gt; it&#039;s good science.  A distraction like, a fat person drinks Diet Coke with their Big Mac, invests heavily in Diet Coke, tells his friends to drink Diet Coke.  

(Also, carbon trading has &#039;racket&#039; written all over it; to think that system won&#039;t be played to breaking-point requires... some naivety, I think.)]]></description>
