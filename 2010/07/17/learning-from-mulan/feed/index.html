		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, Pauline Kael wrote like this: using &quot;you&quot; to describe visceral reactions (&quot;you can&#039;t look away&quot;). She had a reason for writing this way, and so do  I: because I am trying to say that I believe others will have similar reactions. To use &quot;I&quot; would not convey this. In other words I didn&#039;t mean exactly &quot;I&quot; so I didn&#039;t use &quot;I&quot;.  My comment about New Yorker stories was meant to say that among the several hundred New Yorker stories I&#039;ve read, I can&#039;t think of even one whose opening had even close to the same effect. Maybe I should have put like that, you might be right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  As a statistician I prefer precision.  I try to use &quot;I&quot; when I mean &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot; when I mean &quot;you.&quot;  I don&#039;t always succeed, but I try.  If you read your very own blog above, I think you might agree with me that the parts that are strongest are the &quot;I&quot; sentences and the parts that are the weakest are the &quot;you&quot; statements.  The statement about &quot;every short story The New Yorker has published&quot; seems a bit silly to me too.  I understand that you&#039;re engaging in hyperbole, but it still seems silly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, the original story that you link to does not begin with 

&quot;Mulan was weaving. She was having trouble concentrating on her work. The previous night she had learned that her elderly father had been called to military service.&quot;  

Where did you get that phrase?  The poem that you link to begins 

&quot;Ji-ji, again ji-ji,
Mulan faces the door, weaving.
You can&#039;t hear the sound of the loom&#039;s shuttle,
You only hear Daughter&#039;s sighs.

They ask Daughter who&#039;s in her thought,
They ask Daughter who&#039;s on her memory.
&quot;No one is on Daughter&#039;s thought,
No one is on Daughter&#039;s memory.&quot;

Which beginning are describing as the fantastic beginning? 

Which beginning are the other responders reading or responding to ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m fond of this opening paragraph from &lt;i&gt;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&lt;/i&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like &quot;I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive....&quot; And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was screaming: &quot;Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
