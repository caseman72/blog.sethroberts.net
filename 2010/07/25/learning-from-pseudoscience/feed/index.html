		<description><![CDATA[Phil: It means whoever cobbled up Piltdown Man has nothing to offer me.  And it means that Seth&#039;s poster boys don&#039;t either; I will continue looking at evidence about global climate change, but not from them.  Fortunately there are plenty of other people who have no desire to deceive.  It happens that all the other evidence shows incipient disaster, at least for thousands of other species.  It&#039;s just opinion that when thousands of other species go extinct, that&#039;s will be bad for humans too, but it is prudent to expect so until it&#039;s demonstrated otherwise.]]></description>

Nathan, you can&#039;t stop looking at the evidence when you find that someone is trying to deceive you.  Piltdown Man was a hoax, but that doesn&#039;t disprove the theory of evolution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This book is available to download for free - somewhere, dammit - but I can&#039;t find it just now.  Worth a read.  Among many other very interesting things, it gives a great explanation of how bones work - they are surprisingly active.

		<description><![CDATA[When we&#039;ve seen case after case of &quot;evidence&quot; -- the best that can be mustered -- turn out to be cooked or outright fabricated, it becomes entirely reasonable to lose interest in the next one.  I went along, following up denialism claims to see what might be there, for longer than I should have. 

Here&#039;s a time-saver: when you find somebody is trying to deceive you as part of making his case, you can stop looking at evidence, because you have already been notified that there is no case.  Only an illegitimate claim stands to benefit from deception.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Someone asks you about nicotine. You say, &quot;As far as I know, the debate is over.&quot; That&#039;s quite different than saying &quot;The debate is over.

		<description><![CDATA[You say &quot;Whenever Iâ€™ve heard â€œthe debate is overâ€ (= itâ€™s now time to ignore reality) itâ€™s always turned out that the person saying this (e.g., Al Gore, mainstream journalists) was powerful or credulous.&quot;

I don&#039;t think the claim that &quot;the debate is over&quot; is the same as saying it&#039;s now time to ignore reality.  I also think that when the debate is over, it&#039;s OK to say the debate is over.  Suppose someone asks me about, say, whether nicotine is addictive.  That&#039;s not something I have any firsthand knowledge of --- I&#039;ve never done an experiment that would answer this, nor even read a paper about such an experiment.  But it&#039;s my impression that, well, the debate is over.  If I say so, am I ignoring reality?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heh, I was totally with you until the last paragraph.  

I disagree on two counts: first, bones are very sensitive: they use a piezoelectric sense to continually redistribute mineral deposits according the the direction and magnitude of stresses.  Second, you can&#039;t argue that some people &#039;should&#039; be insensitive for the benefit of society - it&#039;s like saying we need a race of Morlocks toiling underground.  We don&#039;t.  Besides, folly doesn&#039;t help anywhere, at any level of society, whether you&#039;re a policy-maker or a fisherman.  Blindness to reality is folly.  The occasional accidental benefits of folly don&#039;t make it indispensable.  

Foolish people aren&#039;t so much like eyeless, insensitive people as people whose eyes can only see their own projections.  When Al Gore looks at climate science data, he is projecting his own conclusions onto it.  I can say this safely because to this day it is clear that we do not know what the truth is, so any overconfident conclusion - on either side - must be a case of projection.  &quot;The wish is father of the thought.&quot;  

Some people will always be more thoughtful or perceptive, but no one should be living in their own hall of mirrors, out of touch with reality.  

I love that you nailed that Feynman argument: I&#039;ve heard that used so loosely all over the place, as an automatic trump-card, so it&#039;s good to see it downgraded from Scripture-status.  You&#039;re right, if the Cargo-cultists gave up their method after seeing it didn&#039;t work, who can criticise them?  Toddlers try out all sorts of things that seem stupid to adults just because they know more due to having already gone through the same experiments.  If adults weren&#039;t so judgmental (and afraid of being judged) they would learn a lot more.]]></description>
