		<description><![CDATA[I have discovered another way to get a good nightâ€™s sleep. A while ago, I heard about a book called AUTOCONDITIONING: THE NEW WAY TO A SUCCESSFUL LIFE, by Hornell Hart. It is long out of print (over fifty years), but I managed to find a used copy on line and ordered it. 

If one can get past the very retro cover, typeface, illustrations, and design, and the very dated vocabulary and  way of writing (â€œgrapple courageously?â€ oh, please), itâ€™s actually worth the trouble. It basically teaches what I would call self-hypnosis, or a way to get in touch with, â€œtalk to,â€ and program your unconscious, subconscious, idâ€”the part of your brain you donâ€™t usually have access to.

Iâ€™m still working on it, but I have learned to do what I call â€œtalking to the Monkeyâ€ and can sometimes get effective results. 

Itâ€™s very good for those little chores that often take too much motivation and so never get done: writing a thank-you or condolence letter, cleaning out a drawer. 

Itâ€™s good for remembering things: if you tend to think of all the things you have to do/buy or people you have to email just as youâ€™re falling asleep, you can give the Monkey a list and tell it to feed it back to you in the morning, when you have a pencil and paper.

And I have found that itâ€™s very effective for getting a good nightâ€™s sleep: I tell the Monkey itâ€™s time to go to sleep now, and that we are going to sleep right through the night and wake at X oâ€™clock, feeling fine. And I no longer even get up to use the bathroomâ€”if I wake up in the night, I remind the Monkey that this is not what we agreed on, and I generally go right back to sleep.

Iâ€™ve also explained to the Monkey that my husbandâ€™s snoring, or the funny noises the house makes when my husband is out of town, are simply â€œbackground musicâ€ that has no significance and will not disturb or wake me. And now my husbandâ€™s snoring doesnâ€™t rouse me and I donâ€™t need earplugs anymore.

It also works on minor painâ€”I can tell the Monkey that the pain is peripheral and unimportant and doesnâ€™t affect me, and although I still feel it, it doesnâ€™t really seem painful.

I havenâ€™t been confronted with any major pain, except migraines, which so far it isnâ€™t very effective against. It helps sometimes, a little bit, for appetite control. And itâ€™s pretty good for coping with worry and anxiety.

As I said, Iâ€™m still working on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No comments? Jeez.

Oh well. Could you please quantify a bit your statement, &quot;The effect does seem stronger...&quot;? Also, it would help to know whether the improvement holds up for more than 3 days, as opposed to it being some transient spike effect.

Thank you.]]></description>
