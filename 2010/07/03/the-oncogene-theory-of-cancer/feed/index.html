		<description><![CDATA[I asked myself why cancer nowdays so often and  very easy to come to us. What went wrong? Did our  lifestyle? Do diet? Did descent? or What??.. I read  medical text book a lot,  do searching, browsing..
according to u Mr.Seth what is the major cause? gene? or lifestyle?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t say that they haven&#039;t helped anyone. There are a few genes that we know do have a strong impact on cancer incidence, like the BRCA1 breast cancer gene. So my relatives that have it know they need extra mammograms and to keep an eye out for it. Is it as potent the smoking-cancer link? Obviously not, but still not nothing.

		<description><![CDATA[Kevin,

I blogged about smoking and cancer recently. 

http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/06/05/cigarettes-are-bad-right/

The results had certain puzzling aspects. I think the likely reason is that small amounts of smoking are protective against cancer because they activate the immune system. Because it&#039;s incredibly hard to determine the dose of tobacco smoke each person has gotten, the results get confusing.]]></description>
