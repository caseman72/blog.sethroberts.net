		<description><![CDATA[This makes sense. About half of all Americans suffer from inflammatory gum disease.
Omega-3s in sufficient dose have an anti-inflammatory response. But note a couple of points here, flax-seed oil is a poor source of omega-3, especially when compared to omega-3 from fish oil. Note too, most store bought fish oil capsules actually contain little onega-3! Only 25 -30% of the contents of the fish oil capsule is actually omega-3. Most of the content is filler, like saturated fats, or omega-6, which is pro-inflammatory. There is also evidence that the ratio of EPA to DHA has an effect on the anti-inflammatory activity. I have seen research done at a major teaching hospital that shows that there is an optimal ratio of EPA to DHA that shows a true anti-inflammatory response. It is only found in a product called OMAX3.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From The Omega Diet (Artemis Simopolous, M.D.) has a chapter on omega-3 and the immune system, including a paragraph on its use to reduce gingivitis.
She cites a French study where half the subjects got 1.8g EPA plus DHA supplements or olive oil supplements, the other half got olive oil supplements.  They were told to practice &quot;intensive&quot; oral hygiene for two weeks and then were told not to brush or floss for 3 weeks.  The omega-3 showed less sign of gingivitis.  

The citation:
Campan, P., P. O. Planchand, and D. Duran. Polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of experimental human gingivitis. Bull Group Int Rech Sci Stomatol Odontol, 1996; 29(1-2):25-31.

Both this book and Dr. Andrew Stoll&#039;s (The Omega-3 Connection) mention that omega-3&#039;s benefits for the immune system came from a study of the Greenland Eskimos in the 1970s.  

The first book is mostly a food book, the second is more about fishoil in improving brain health, esp. depression (Stoll does research in Psychopharmacology). 

My note:  high quality extra virgin olive oil has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@bjk: I&#039;ve found something similar just from regular cod liver oil. 

I started taking that, combined with Vitamin D, after reading on the Cooling Inflammation blog that flushing associated with rosacea is caused by inflammation similar to Alzheimers (he called it Alzheimers of the face) and can be treated with increased amounts of D. (Summary written quickly and maybe not totally accurate.)

With chewable Carlson&#039;s D, and then D + Carlson&#039;s CL oil (which also has D) My flushing disappeared almost overnight. Also, while previous attention to gut bacteria (though diet and supplementation) had mostly taken care of my acne, the oil took it the rest of the way--and helped to get rid of that irritated feeling you mention. For a while, it felt like anything on my face--fingers, the ends of my hair, moisturizer--would irritate my skin and cause a breakout. Now, nothing seems to. And on the rare occasions when I do break out, it clears up right away.

And Seth: My gums got pinker and pinker (as opposed to red) with this supplementation, which worried me (I thought maybe I was making myself anemic or something) until I read--I think on your blog--that red gums signal inflammation while pink gums are nice and cooled down.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve found the fermented cod liver oil the best delivery vehicle for omega3s. It&#039;s also important to consume the paste (chocolate and FCLO) more than once a day. Once a day usually didn&#039;t do the trick. Using the FCLO, I&#039;ve reduced the acne on my face by about 75% (this is in conjunction with reducing my vegetable oil/omega6 consumption by about 90%). Significantly, my face doesn&#039;t feel irritated to the touch anymore, and it has a nice soft feel  . . . I can shave without wincing. The FCLO was better than ordinary CLO, flaxseed oil, and sardines, all of which I tried, in order of increasing effectiveness. The dermatologist I visited recently said he&#039;d never heard the vegetable oil -&gt; acne theory before. It makes sense, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, why was Chinese flaxseed oil not helping? Because it was poorly processed. Probably was at room temperature too long. ChrisF, flaxseed oil needs to be refrigerated to slow down deterioration. I wouldn&#039;t buy it from Amazon because it is mailed without refrigeration. I haven&#039;t noticed quality differences across brands.

Annie, hemp seed oil has much less omega-3 per ml than flaxseed oil. So it won&#039;t work as well. Even with flaxseed oil, I had to drink a lot to get the best effect. I am unaware of a benefit specific to flax. Since we get lots of omega-6 in our diet, e.g., from nuts, I never try to get more in one particular food. You are more likely to be getting too much omega-6 than too little, in my opinion.

Jen, yes, I think fish oil would have the same effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking for myself, I find the taste of flaxseed oil quite noxious.  I assume that&#039;s why Seth uses a noseclip.  Best consumption method for me is two tablespoons in a glass, a blast of faucet water and a fast chug.

My gums have not noticeably improved, despite morning and evening consumption.  I ordered my oil from Amazon but have left it sitting on the counter.  Should it be refrigerated?  Is there noticeable quality variation across brands?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth - I&#039;ve been following your experiments with flax, both for dental health and appetite suppression.  Do you suppose hemp seed oil would produce the same benefits?  I&#039;m inclined to use hemp seed oil because it&#039;s supposed to be a better balance of omega 6s and 3s.  In doing so, I wonder if I&#039;d be foregoing a benefit that is exclusive to flax?]]></description>
