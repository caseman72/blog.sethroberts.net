		<description><![CDATA[Dennis, yes, that is the key insight. And, yes, it answers the question you asked me a while ago. The broader point is that it&#039;s possible to find out what the distribution of treatment effects has been (in similar experiments) and then tune the test to be most sensitive to that distribution. The current assumption that everyone changes the same amount is probably the least plausible assumption that could be made.]]></description>

The key insight here is the following, and it answers a question I posed to you some time back:

&quot;I suspect that actual treatment effects have a power-law distribution..&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I did not mean to imply that clinical statisticians are illiterate, but only that, say, a beginner statistics course would do very well to include your example as a way to promote literacy in working with data. It is simple, but interesting because it&#039;s real. A pretty good combination for an educational topic.

I will ask a couple of my math ed colleagues to look at the topic and see what comes of it.

Also, I would like to thank you for a few very simple changes I made after reading your blog, which had unexpectedly large result/effort ratios.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maria,

Thanks for your interest. The statistical point I am making here is pretty simple, yes, but the people who run clinical trials hire statisticians to analyze the data. To say those statisticians are not statistically literate is a little complicated. The point I make here has not appeared in the statistical literature (or biomedical literature) as far as I know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In Kevin Denny&#039;s example, post-treatment distribution A (with 100 added to 1 person) has a much larger variance than distribution B (with 25 added to 4 people).  So, any statistical test is going to be more sensitive to B: they will be a smaller p-value and it will be more statistically significant.  Just as Seth initially claimed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I worked for a pharmaceutical company, I used to conduct interviews and focus groups with doctors.  I have some reservations about the quality of their clinical judgment.

Doctors are susceptible to the same sorts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cognitive biases&lt;/a&gt;  that afflict everyone else.  (Example: If your first three patients on Prozac all did very well, you&#039;ll be a Prozac loyalist for years.)  With doctors, though, the cognitive biases might be even worse than average, though, because doctors are typically overconfident in their own abilities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kevin, Feynman was complaining about the same thing as me -- a focus on process rather than results among people who claim to be scientists. To point out other people who had similar ideas is reviewing the literature.

I&#039;m talking about how best to detect heterogeneous treatment effects, yes. I am saying that what you call the &quot;scientific&quot; method is likely to be better at detecting certain treatment effects and worse at detecting others than the method it replaced. Of course it is better to base medicine on evidence than on no evidence. But there is more than one way of evaluating evidence and the current way has a certain disadvantage (greatest sensitivity to homogenous treatment effects) not shared by the method it replaced (reliance on clinical experience).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But you&#039;re skewing the point by pre-choosing an overall mean (100) and then dividing it up different ways.  Then it&#039;s merely tautological that the overall mean is changed by the same amount.  The real issue is if the treatment helps 10% of people by X vs. helping 100% of people by X.  In the former situation, it won&#039;t change the overall mean nearly as much, even if it&#039;s a real effect for those 10% of people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this post is terrible. Firstly, you try to bring Feynman in on your side because Feynman was a genius &amp; everyone cashing in on his name (like the &quot;Feynman&#039;s Rainbow&quot; book advertised on your blog. But the connection with cargo-cult science is far from clear.
Secondly the statement about means being more sensitive when the treatment change each person by the same amount as opposed to a fraction of the population etc is hilariously wrong. Means DON&#039;T CARE who is changed.
Example:Pre-treatment distribution
 1,2,3,4
Post-treatment (A):
101,2,3,4
Post-treatment (B):
26,27,28,29
In one case I added 100 to just one subject in the second I added 25 to all 4. So the mean changes by the same amount. D&#039;oh. 
If you are taking about Medians, thats different but treatment effect models seldom look at this parameter. Or are you talking about heterogenous treatment effects? 
It seems to me that you are trying to provide some sort of veneer of respectibility to anecdotal evidence relative to those who do things the correct i.e. the scientific way. Its not about using different &quot;filters&quot;. I really doubt if Feynman woud have derided those who followed proper scientific methods as you appear to suggest.]]></description>
