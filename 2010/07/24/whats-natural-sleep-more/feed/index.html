		<description><![CDATA[I have insomnia where I can fall asleep very easily but awaken two hours later and cant fall back asleep until dawn, it which case its time to get up. 

I have done quite a few experiments on my self with food and have found that oils or foods high in omega 3 will wake me up early. Worst offenders are flax, fish oil, chia seed. I also discovered inadvertently that omega 3 oils in lotions and other topicals are absorbed and will wake me up early even in the tiniest amounts (Im talking a few drops of flax or fish oil!). 

I should note that my insomnia began about 8 months after starting a program for acne which included 1-3 tablespoons per day of fish oil. 
Im pretty sure I messed up my omega 3 to omega 6 balance. I had symptoms of omega 6 deficiency that went away after I quit taking fish oil, but the insomnia persists. Supplementing with omega 6 oils helps somewhat but is not a cure. I fall asleep very easily but awaken two hours later and cant fall back asleep until dawn, it which case its time to get up. 

Any ideas?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am trying to figure out my sleep problems too.  I live in the northwest (rainy gray Washington).  I made an observation.  On a sunny day, I laid out in the sun, with maximum exposure on my body, for about an hour and I DID sleep better that night.  We don&#039;t get many days that I can do that.  

I just recently came back from California where I got lots of sun exposure so I assume that my Vit D is up there (also take supplements and eat nutrient dense foods) but my sleep is still poor.  Waking many times throughout the night and feeling less rested in the morning.  

So, I really think that the &quot;sun&quot; exposure has more effects/affects than providing the Vitamin D for me.  It might be the &quot;light&quot; itself.  Wondering if I got one of the those lights for people with Seasonal Affective Syndrome would help my sleep?

I would like to try the standing on one leg.  I will let you know how that goes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, have you tried standing on a BOSU or wobble board? 

I have a inflatable blue pancake type thing called a J Fit that I got off of Amazon for about $15. I first got it to sit on at work, on the theory that maybe strengthening my core would help my back problems. (At first I could use it for only 20 minutes at a time, but now I sit on it most of the day. As a bonus, I have excellent posture. Also, my back problems are gone, but I think some other things--such as switching to flat shoes--made more of a difference.) 

Anyway, you can also stand on the JFit, or do sit ups on it, and it&#039;s designed to put you a little bit off balance and make your muscles work harder. One legged standing would definitely be more difficult, even using the same exact stance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[According to a study from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health:

&quot;skipping breakfast was associated with increased prevalence of obesity (odds ratio = 4.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.57, 12.90)&quot;

So, while skipping breakfast may help you sleep better, it will (statistically at least), make you more likely to become obese.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Seth

Excellent post.  Riffing on your thoughts here:

&lt;i&gt;1. Aerobic exercise. When I started swimming, I noticed that I fell asleep much faster â€” within a minute rather than within several minutes. Aerobic exercise didnâ€™t solve the bigger problem of waking up tired, however.&lt;/i&gt;

I think the benefits you received from swimming have to do with being in water at some temperature that was considerably less then your own body temperature.  

Reason I think this is that I used to sleep quite well after swimming pratice, playing water polo, surfing or swimming in the ocean.

Also, Tim Ferris talks about hacking his sleep with ice baths.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve experienced a bizarre shift in sleep habits.

For my whole life I was a 10-hour sleeper. If I didn&#039;t get 10 hours, I&#039;d fall asleep in class. I could never stay awake in meetings or lectures. About 30% of every movie I saw in a theater I accidentally slept through.

Then came a slew of intense anxiety episodes, which were probably exacerbated by malnutrition. At some point I experienced a severe shift in how I slept.

Since then, my body is never drowsy and I can only get 5 hours of sleep per night. I wake up in the middle of the night often, sometimes taking 1-2 hours to fall back asleep. I never feel rested.

I mention this because I find it interesting that before this occurred, I broke every &quot;rule&quot; in the book of sleep (drank caffeine at night, kept inconsistent sleep schedules, lots of artificial light, etc).

Now I follow every rule in the book, yet it has no effect.

I suspect something permanently changed in my hypothalamus (which can be damaged from stress and malnutrition), or my HPA-axis at large -- permanent in the same way a type 1 diabetic undergoes a permanent biological change.

This has been going on for about 2 years. The only relief I get is from trazodone. I will start trying some of these ideas to see how they affect my sleep. Aerobic exercise is something that had no subjective impact on sleep quality prior to my change; after, however, it does have an impact -- I do sleep better if I exercise during the day. I find this interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I previously mentioned pistol squats and variations as well and still think they make sense. They would enlist a similar, if not identical, number of muscles and it would be simple to test with little downside and a potentailly large upside -- if it worked you could perhaps get the total-refreshment feeling you got from longer periods of standing. If more challenge didn&#039;t work, it would be clear within a few nights. Consistent with the general principles of self-experimentation you outline Seth.

I&#039;d do it, but I tried the 9 hr standing experiment and it did not improve my sleep, nor did the one-leg to exhaustion technique.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Did you try my suggestion of bending your leg more?&quot; No. To make it more about how long one muscle can hold out is to make it more about stressing only one muscle.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing more of these things, over time.  Because of the posts I&#039;ve read here, I started standing 8 hours a day at work for two semesters.  I also started skipping breakfast because of the shangri-la diet (i take the oil in the mornings).  I am very active throughout the day and I go to the RSF gym at night, though.  A coworker calls me a vampire, since I am up most of the night.  I don&#039;t need to sleep a lot. I see faces in the mornings, since I work at about 6 am.  I don&#039;t get much morning light, though, because I am indoors at a cafe, where I work. I started eating 1/4 stick of butter every night.  It actually also makes food taste very good, too!

This has helped me be more productive and sleep a lot less.  Also, since I am taking 3 tbsp of flaxseed oil everyday, I don&#039;t have to worry about eating food.  I could eat very little in a day, so this helps me put my energy into doing things that have value to me, instead of thinking of what I will eat when I get hungry. 

Incorporating these ideas into my life has allowed me to save my job, which I was about to lose due to anxiety, and to move out of my parent&#039;s house.  Also, it has kept me out of the hospital.  

Thank you, Seth and all the people who contribute/comment on this blog!! I love all of your ideas!!!]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been doing more of these things, over time.  Because of the posts I&#8217;ve read here, I started standing 8 hours a day at work for two semesters.  I also started skipping breakfast because of the shangri-la diet (i take the oil in the mornings).  I am very active throughout the day and I go to the RSF gym at night, though.

		<description><![CDATA[Did you try my suggestion of bending your leg more?  I assure you, you can easily make this exercise more difficult and keep the time down without losing relevant verisimilitude in the kind of stimulus.  

At the extreme strength-level imaginable, you could do ten or twenty minutes of continuous pistol-squats.  I&#039;m not sure any human is capable of this.  Indian pelwanhi wrestlers do oodles of this particular type of squat every day:

You&#039;re just doing a low-intensity one-legged squat, mate - you can optimize this without losing any of the effects you&#039;re after; I&#039;d almost lay money on it.  After all, you know that walking and standing does as well, so you can probably safely narrow the required type of stimulus down to &#039;long-duration lower-body exercise&#039;.  

Who specifically doesn&#039;t want strong legs?  If you do them with good form they won&#039;t necessitate your doing a load of other exercises to balance out - I guess you would end up resembling a cyclist rather than a typical bodybuilder.]]></description>
