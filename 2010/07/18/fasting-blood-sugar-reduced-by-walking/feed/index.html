		<description><![CDATA[Peter at the Hyperlipid blog describes why a low-carb diet may raise fasting blood sugar, and why it may not be a problem. Search for physiologic insulin resistance at the Hyperlipd blog and you will find It. Have you measured your A1C? This might be a better measure of your overall blood sugar control. What happens if you add a few carbs, say ~100g/day for a few days?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a good example of self-experimentation leading to a successful intervention.  But you could also have consulted a doctor, or a diabetes website, and probably found out about the benefits of walking for controlling blood glucose a lot sooner.  And dearieme, your doctor should probably poke around online too. For instance, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://diabetes.about.com/od/benefitsofexercise/a/walking.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;about.com entry&lt;/a&gt; says &quot;Walking is one of the most popular and widely recommended forms of physical activity for people with diabetes&quot;, but warns &quot;Foot health is particularly important for anyone with diabetes, so the input of a podiatrist may be especially useful if you&#039;re considering a walking program.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At UCSD in 2006, I attended a bioengineering seminar given by an old man (I think he was a famous old chemical engineering professor, but I could be wrong) who was a diabetic.  He explained his self experimentation to control his blood sugar levels. He found that he only needed light exercise for about 15 minutes after each meal to keep his blood sugar levels at a reasonable level. Maybe the focus could be on stopping the blood sugar from rising in the first place?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have found the same thing as you, Seth: that long walks not only bring down BG levels. I also found that walking causes BG levels to drop more rapidly than normal after eating. So the usual 2-3 hours that it takes to return to baseline is cut in half or shorter. Paradoxically, I found that intense exercise, like running or strenuous weight workouts actually cause a brief rise of 10-40 points in BG, but then a return to a level lower than starting.  So I think the difference vs. walking is that strenuous exercise causes release of glucose from glycogen or stored fat &amp; muscle (gluconeogenesis), followed by a drop to a lower baseline.  I summarized these and a range of other findings (such as the BG-lowering effect of coconut oil) a few months ago and posted on your forum: http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=7511.0]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am just starting this to bring my glucose level down. I just got some walking poles (walkingpoles.com) to try to involve the upper body muscles. A half-hour does not have much effect so I am going to increase it to 1 hour. 
Sort of off topic. I am reading &quot;Becoming a Successful Scientist&quot; by Craig Loehle and he recommends long walks as an effective technique for deeper rumination and contemplation. Walking may be a toofer!
