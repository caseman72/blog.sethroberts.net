		<description><![CDATA[In the previous I should have mentioned the case of my own autism theory publication. It was accepted by editor HJ Eysenck (most cited scientist ever) via a process of peer-review.   Just his use of peer-review was an honest, open-minded one rather than the hostile sloppy bigotry that I had encountered from other journals (as explained in my letter in Nature http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9121540 ). There&#039;s a link to the paper at top of http://www.autismcauses.info , which also has some indications of the update review I&#039;m preparing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I applaud William Baines&#039;s initiative with this new journal.  My main reservation about it is that it explicity disowns &quot;peer review&quot;.  The problem with &quot;peer review&quot; is not the peer-review system per se, of referring to reviewers (actually PREviewers).  It would work fine if employed in a positive mode rather than a nitpicking closedminded mode.  But by saying &quot;we don&#039;t use peer review&quot;, this unnecessarily opens a wide door of opportunity for the deceitful Forces of Darkness to pretend that the journal lacks legitimacy.
Also I dislike the word &quot;Hypotheses&quot; in the title.  All my own published theories are developed structures that are far beyond mere hypotheses and attachment of such a word would demean them.  I myself put forward a new title of &quot;Biomed Ideas&quot; but was too ill to develop it.  I fervently hope the new journal will change to that far superior name as soon as possible; please consider any copyright I have on it transferred to yourselves!]]></description>
