		<description><![CDATA[My problems were exacerbated by the psychiatric drugs. But I was on a statin for a year-and-a-half before taking any of the other drugs. All of the mental problems showed up prior to taking any of the psychiatric drugs. None of the problems went away until after discontinuing the statin, even though I had discontinued taking the psychiatric drugs weeks, months, or years earlier.

If I have time, I&#039;ll blog my experiences in a linear fashion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apparently these three large randomized placebo-controlled trials got the wrong answer. Curious.

I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s curious or predictable. I&#039;m currently reading &quot;White Coats and Black Hats&quot; an expose of pharmaceutical company marketing practices. It&#039;s very common to publish studies supporting their product while ignoring or denying any ill effects. These companies manage to publish in many &quot;respected&quot; journals as well as their own, in house, journals and hide the conflict of interest]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My mum was prescribed statins as a precautionary measure due to cholesterol levels only slightly above the official acceptable threshold.  She was hesitant to take the medication and asked me to look up the side-effects online.  She did this because she knew two people who had specifically warned her off ever taking statins because of the major side-effects they had endured; among other things, hair-loss.   One of them, a woman who had had a full head of hair and no history of alopecia, now had barely a wisp left.  

This is not a medication that should be given out on the basis of statistics because there are too many unknowns and danger-signs.  It should be given out like ECT: when there is short-term danger to the patient and other methods have failed.]]></description>
