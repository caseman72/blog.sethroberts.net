		<description><![CDATA[Just curious, anyone know who authored the 2002 MDMA website?  McGraw Hill has a text called Taking Sides which offers a pro/con analysis of several drug topics, and in it, Iversen argues that Ecstasy isn&#039;t as bad as some people make it out to be.  That 2002 MDMA website had to have been written by someone very very knowledgeable in pharma, as well as sympathetic to the cause...could it have been Iversen?  He&#039;s been around since the 60&#039;s, at least....

http://www.mcgrawhill.ca/highereducation/product/9780078127564/taking+sides:+clashing+views+in+drugs+and+society/

&quot;Issue 4. Are the Dangers of Ecstasy (MDMA) Overstated?
YES: Leslie Iversen, from Speed, ecstasy, Ritalin: The Science of Amphetamines (Oxford University Press, 2006)
NO: National Institute on Drug Abuse, from â€œMDMA (ecstasy) Abuse,â€ National Institute on Drug Abuse Research Report (March 2006)
Author Leslie Iversen contends that ecstasy can result in adverse effects but that the drug has been unfairly demonized. Moreover, Iversen states that its negative consequences on the brain have not been proven conclusively. Iversen acknowledges that ecstasy may produce profound effects, although those effects are subject to an individualâ€™s perception. Club drugs such as ecstasy allow partygoers to dance and remain active for long periods of time according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). However, ecstasy may produce a number of adverse effects such as high blood pressure, panic attacks, loss of consciousness, seizures, and death. Moreover, ecstasy can produce negative effects on the brain, resulting in confusion, depression, memory impairment, and attention difficulties.&quot;]]></description>
