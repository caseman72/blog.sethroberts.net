		<description><![CDATA[Marina, I have removed the spammy links in your comment. You cannot be serious. First, benzoyl peroxide actually works. I tested it. Second, Accutane is dangerous. It has bad side effects. It is expensive. It doesn&#039;t &quot;cure&quot; the acne nor provide more than &quot;temporary relief&quot;. It&#039;s just another drug. Using Accutane is a distraction from figuring out what has caused the acne. Probably something about the diet. Not lack of Accutane. I suppose the problem with Accutane is partly revealed by comments such as yours. If Accutane were so great, it wouldn&#039;t need to be marketed in misleading ways.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It never fails to amaze me how the cosmetics &amp; pharmaceutical industries continue to rip acne suffers off providing them with useless products in order to fuel cyclical consumption. Think how many billions are made from selling rubbish like Benzoyl Peroxide or using Tetracycline antibiotics. They can never cure the acne just provide temporary relief if it can even be called that. 
Moderate/ Sever acne needs to be treated seriously with Accutane which has been used to treat 13 million people worldwide for over 25 years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Food is responsible for a vanishing minority of acne&quot; -- what is this conclusion based on? I know of no evidence that supports that idea.

&quot;Generalizing from your experience and presuming it applies to others is foolish.&quot; Years after I discovered that tetracycline did not help my acne, articles started appearing in dermatology journals saying the same thing. In this case, at least, generalizing from my experience would have been a good idea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[what a load of irresponsible crap.  food is responsible for a vanishing minority of acne, and people looking for an acne fix by adjusting their diet are in for a long wait-as in, until the process burns out.  accutane (13 cis retinoic acid, or 13cra) does not cause depression, rather, severe acne is associated with a near doubling of suiccide risk.  this is clear from the medical literature.  it is great to self-experiment, but only a fool would ignore what has been already learned by previous investigators.  furthermore, generalizing from your experience and presuming it applies to others is foolish.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s garden variety acne (zits and whiteheads)...and then there&#039;s cystic acne where the lesions look like someone put peas under your skin.  A friend of mine had cystic acne.  She was miserable both because the lesions hurt and because of the social effects of having your face look deformed.  She took Accutane when it first came out in the 80&#039;s.  The doctors were very cautious back then and would only prescribe it for serious acne.  I can understand why someone with cystic acne might consider suicide...and maybe that might then convince the doctors that they needed the stronger treatment.  I think if I looked the way she did at 25, and felt so depressed that I wanted to kill myself, I just might do it if my dermatologist told me to go home and experiment with my diet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, thanks for stating what you had believed/anticipated to work prior to your experiment.

Michael, how about you think about that some longer. I could tell you what I found out, but it&#039;s better to find out for oneself.

Cheers!]]></description>
