		<description><![CDATA[Justin, by the title (Why I am a Biological Psychologist) I meant that this sort of failure to replicate is a nightmare but is not easily avoidable outside biological psychology. (At least, I don&#039;t know how to avoid it. The cost of doing widely-varying replications before you publish is too high.) Apparently the choice overload effect depends on details of the experimental procedure that researchers in that field have no idea about. Whereas if I study the effect of omega-3 and other nutrients on brain function (an example of biological psychology) the results are more likely to be easy to replicate. For example, when I found that breakfast caused me to wake up too early I was repeating an effect that had been found in several other species, where it was called anticipatory activity. Another example is that my ideas about weight control are supported by rat research. If they are true for some humans and some rats, they are likely to be true for all humans.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be surprised if anyone figures out why Iyengar&#039;s finding is hard to repeat. It&#039;s hard enough to repeat the stuff that is repeatable.

Learned helplessness was not important for central ideas about learning; nobody would build a theory upon it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow! I&#039;d assumed that both the Seligman and Iyengar were robust findings. I think one reason they have become &quot;important&quot; apparently despite replicability is that they have the feel of &quot;insight&quot; that we can relate to. I find it easy to feel overwhelmed by too many options and to thus lose any subjective sense that I am making a choice. And it&#039;s easy to relate to the idea that after being in situations where one is objectively helpless, one can carry over the assumption of helplessness to contexts where one is no longer helpless, and get depressed. It&#039;s all very accessible. We can have an &quot;aha!&quot; experience when we learn about the findings.

I wonder if when something feels intuitive and has resonance in one&#039;s experience, it is likely to have staying power in psychology, even when there is little scientific basis for it. Someone should study this more systematically.

You&#039;ve got me wondering what other famous findings in psychology are weakly founded....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel sorry for all those dogs that Martin Seligman tortured.  And speaking of torture, Seligman has been criticized for his role in the US  government&#039;s interrogation programs:

Having said that, I do admire Seligman for his role in promoting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-12-08-happy-main_x.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;positive psychology&lt;/a&gt;.

Regarding the choice studies:  I find Iyengar&#039;s results to be plausible.  When I eat in a restaurant that has a huge menu, I find myself overwhelmed with the number of choices and start to worry that I won&#039;t order the optimal dish.

With regard to prominent authorities being wrong, I&#039;m about two-thirds of the way through an excellent and entertaining book called, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Wrong-us-Scientists-relationship-consultants/dp/0316023787&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wrong: Why Experts Keep Failing Us â€” And How to Know When Not to Trust Them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, by David H. Freedman.  The book reiterates what I more or less knew already, but I enjoy learning about the many examples that Freedman uses to back up his points.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of a friend who wasted several years of a PhD meticulously trying and failing to replicate an effect upon which a famous Professor had built their reputation - he concluded that the whole thing was probably due to a small but significant sloppiness or dishonesty in the conduct of the experiments - a matter of recording observations about a second later than was supposed to be the case according to the stated methodology - and this delay meant that a different (old-hat, mundane, obvious, uninteresting) psychological mechanism would explain everything without recourse to the new reputation-building theory. 

Examples of this are still happening - I have seen with my own eyes a rapid build-up of an international research program and hasty public policy implementation based upon a really simple error in matching control with stimulus.]]></description>
