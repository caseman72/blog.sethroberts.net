		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Gmail already has these features, almost.  Look into the Labs add-on called &quot;Undo Send&quot;, it it will allow you to delay an outbound message up to 30 seconds.  Unfortunately no loger than that. 

Also, you can sort by oldest but the option is only available after a certain number of messages.  Go to All Mail then look at the top right.  You should see: &quot;1 - 100 of 49833 Older â€º  Oldest Â»&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, Seth re: delay. When I&#039;m in a bad mood I sometimes later regret some messages. Right now the 10 second delay is pretty useless. It&#039;s usually after some pondering that I realize I should have edited. A programmable time is good, as is a day. You&#039;d need a list of &quot;pending&quot; messages. All in all, Gmail&#039;s pretty good, esp. for free.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used to use a 10-minute delay on all outgoing emails. Not as long as the day you suggest, but long enough to realise if I&#039;ve made a major boo-boo and retrieve it.

The closest GMail has is the &quot;Undo Send&quot; lab, which gives you up to 30s to reconsider. I still often un-send and edit emails within that time. Unfortunately as soon as you navigate anywhere else you lose the undo option, but it&#039;s better than nothing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thinking about it, a (less than optimal) solution to your first problem is to also pick up your Gmail in an actual email client, e.g. Thunderbird, using Gmail&#039;s POP download facility. That way, when you need to view your emails in chronological order, you could do it in Thunderbird. 

Not great but better than nothing.]]></description>

Try Boomerang for Gmail.

http://www.baydin.com/boomerang4gmail/

It&#039;s a Gmail plugin that lets you schedule when you send emails. Somewhat bizarrely, it also lets you schedule when to receive emails, or at least when to have them reappear having been already received.]]></description>
