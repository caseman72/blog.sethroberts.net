		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, sorry this is a little off topic, I&#039;m commenting here since it&#039;s the most recent entry about self-experimentation and mood disorders. My question is, in your self-experimentation, have you found any tricks that help to get over a broken heart? Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In her book &quot;Treating Bipolar Disorder: A Clinician&#039;s Guide to Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy&quot;,  Ellen Frank makes the interesting point that behavioral activation alone (i.e. just doing something) was equally efficacious to a complete cognitive therapy treatment in bringing about a resolution of unipolar depression. (page 102).

Perhaps a cold shower is a good way to get someone to just do something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The mood elevating effect of cold immersion is a common topic among cold water swimmers. I was first exposed to this idea in 2007 by Piotr Wozniak, a sleep and memory researcher. My first experience produced an elevated mood that lasted for about 2 days; but I associated this elation with the rush of doing something that I felt to be risky and coming through it unharmed. (January; Baltic Sea) However, once I&#039;d broken the ice, I started swimming in cold water regularly, and it always elevated my mood. Swimming is fun in general, but swimming in warm water, or swimming in cold water with a wet suit on, does not produce the same after effect of elation. I have never experienced as extended a period of elation as after my first swim; normally, the most noticeable effect lasts about 4 hours, with a lingering effect for the rest of the day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a big fan of cold water swimming, and I surf without a wetsuit.  I&#039;m out there as many mornings as I can fit in.  I never get a cold or flu, and I&#039;m usually pretty upbeat.  I never put 2 and 2 together, but it very well could be a result of all that time in the cold surf.  I take lukewarm showers, but I&#039;ll try going without any hot water to see if it kicks things up a notch.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. I started having only cold showers a couple of weeks ago to see if I would still get the hives I usually got from hot showers. I no longer got the hives and I also noticed an improved mood. 

I don&#039;t know if the heat caused the hives, or if it was prolonged exposure to fluoridated water. Cold showers are usually of short duration, so I might try some short hot showers.]]></description>
