		<description><![CDATA[Finding a miraculous &#039;cure,&#039; being disappointed, and then repeating the cycle is the norm for most chronic medical conditions.  And this treatment is no ordinary placebo - these patients spent many thousands of dollars, left the country, and had invasive surgery on their neck veins *against* the advice of their doctors and neurologists.  Talk about cognitive dissonance effects!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael, I am unaware of remissions in MS as large and long-lasting as the one described in my quote from the first case (&quot;Before the procedure...&quot;). Are you? If so is there a description you could point me to?

All diseases go up and down, just as all measurements do. It&#039;s the size and duration of the up/down variation that&#039;s interesting, not its existence.

Vic, I&#039;d be very surprised if liberation therapy was the first treatment these patients had tried. A placebo explanation of these results doesn&#039;t explain why the previous treatments these patients tried didn&#039;t work. Nor does a placebo explanation explain why blockage in the opened vein is associated with the improvement disappearing. And I am unaware of any placebo that produces MS results as good as those described in the article. They&#039;ve been tested and don&#039;t work this well. For example, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2896%2909377-4/abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You do know that MS often occurs in a relapsing/remitting form?  Changes like this don&#039;t have to be attributed to either interventions or placebo effects: they can be an inherent feature of the natural history of the disease.  MS can&#039;t be viewed as a typical degenerative disease, with a continuous decline in functioning for all patients.  So no, a single case report like this in MS cannot be convincing evidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I think you grossly underestimate the power of the mind over the body.  The boundary between needing a wheelchair and a cane is often very fuzzy, and certainly depends on one&#039;s mental state.  I&#039;ve seen people walk out of wheelchairs on televangelist shows.  I&#039;ve often encountered medical case reports that seem similarly &#039;remarkable,&#039; such as a woman confining herself to bed for over 30 years because of unremittant pain, whose pain suddenly went away completely after a placebo.  There is work by Ramachandran showing that unbearable phantom limb pain can be made to go away using a mirror.  When people are told that a device drives an electric current through their brain they develop a headache.  Lots of studies have documented little connection between chronic pain (back, neck, shoulder, head, knee) and physical abnormalities (except in arthritis or extreme cases).  

If you showed me a placebo controlled study and the liberation group did much better than the placebo group then I might believe something is happening.  If you don&#039;t have a placebo group, which I am aware you are not a fan of, then the evidence needs to be much stronger - show me that 7 out of 10 people go from needing a wheelchair to being almost fully functional for a period of a year or more and it *starts* approaching the level of evidence that shows that vitamin C cures scurvy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[vic, to take just the first story:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the procedure, Mr. Garvie used a wheelchair, had no control over his bladder and his left side was completely numb. . . Seven months after the surgery, he stopped taking his bladder pills and the colour had returned to his left foot. He now walks with a cane,&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Why do you think such improvement could be normal variation or a placebo effect? I don&#039;t know of any studies of MS -- or any studies of anything -- that have found placebo effects like these.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, Seth, you and I interpret things really differently.  I am completely convinced, like you, that most of the time doctors don&#039;t know what they are talking about and that most pharmacological interventions are useless or worse - still, the results of these MS patients are not remotely in the same ballpark as results from Vitamin C in scurvy patients.  Many symptoms of MS are both subjective and influenced by mental states, and their are natural improvements and deteriotiations in the patient&#039;s MS without treatment.  When I read about the improvements these patients describe they seem well within the normal bounds of MS, without any evidence for an effect of treatment beyond the psychological/placebo.]]></description>
