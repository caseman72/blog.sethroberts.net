		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Bruce.  But if someone &lt;i&gt;insists&lt;/i&gt; on going into science anyway, my advice would be to find a mentor who has a reputation of being good to his or her graduate students (i.e., paying attention to them and ensuring that they finish their PhDs in a reasonable amount of time).  Finding an interesting research topic is all very well and good, but if you can&#039;t get out of grad school, the point becomes moot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m afraid that my first response would be to try to dissuade them from a *career* in science (which hardly exists now, and will be even rarer by the time that they are dvanced in their research program) - and instead to do real science as an amateur hobby, instead of becoming a manager or technician merely pretending to do science as a paid job.]]></description>
