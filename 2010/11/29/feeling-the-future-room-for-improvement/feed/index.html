		<description><![CDATA[As I tried to argue in the related case of Alternative/ Complementary healing - http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/95/10/643.full - I believe that the problem for this kind of study, of a phenomenon whose nature is unknown, is that &#039;controlled trials&#039; are strictly impossible/ nonsensical. 

In this instance, since the nature of hypothetical psi is unknown, and the features that influence it, it is not possible to &#039;control&#039; the trial. 

When a causal phenomenon is understood, then a trial can be controlled - and the better controlled the experiment, the clearer will be the result. 

The level of significance in frequentist statistical testing is merely a distraction - a mere arbitrary convention applied to a no-causal hypotheses (the &#039;null hypothesis&#039; has nothing to do with causation). 

And significance testing has nothing to do with (is orthogonal to) causality: http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2010/10/scope-and-nature-of-epidemiology.html.]]></description>
