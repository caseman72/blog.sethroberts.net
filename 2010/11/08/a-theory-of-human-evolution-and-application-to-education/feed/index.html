		<description><![CDATA[Being as the division of human labour (excluding male/female differences) only really becomes prominent with sedentism in the neolithic around 10,000 years ago, and 10,000 years would generally be considered far to short a time for significant evolutionary change, it would be unlikely that division of labour would have had any effect on &quot;human nature&quot;.

Do we really need this whole &quot;theory&quot; just to tell us that people have different personalities?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[QUOTE:
&quot;Language began because it increased trade.&quot;

Since many animal species have very sophisticated languages, then what goods are being traded when birds sing, lions roar, fireflies flash, and insects click?

Isn&#039;t it more likely that language evolved because it had a direct role in survival and reproduction?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;When I gave them enough choice, they found activities they really wanted to do.&quot;

This sounds exactly like how we homeschool. I remember learning in a Taoist philosophy class in university that people are stripped down into finely honed copies of productive human tools through education/training - and the decision for which tool to become is often made earlier in life than perhaps necessary. My partner and I try to expose our kids to as diverse a range of possible human activities as we can, and it&#039;s very interesting to see their different preferences, given the same external input.

Great post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pip, as someone who incessantly plays with his tableware, I have to say you may have something there. Animals have plenty of desire for novelty -- they need to explore to find new food sources. That by itself doesn&#039;t lead to tool making or else the entire animal kingdom would make tools. Whether people added some sort of desire to manipulate stuff to that I don&#039;t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting theory. One question -  you reference a desire for novelty as an incentive to innovate, but did not talk about where the desire for novelty came from. Is it possible that the desire for novelty also had a hand in the development of hobbies and is was not just the practical considerations that drove the beginning of hobbies?

My theory is that the desire for novelty (and risk taking) in at least part of a population helped survival because it drove migration into new environments. The need to adapt quickly to new environments plus the desire for novelty led to tool-making and hobbies. 

Those of us who inherited the strongest desire for novelty and have the hardest time staying in one place are now diagnosed as ADHD. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting to use shoes fitting into boxes instead of shoes fitting on feet.  

But aren&#039;t shoes too great an example of your thesis to throw them in at the end as something that comes in different shapes and sizes for putting into containers?]]></description>
