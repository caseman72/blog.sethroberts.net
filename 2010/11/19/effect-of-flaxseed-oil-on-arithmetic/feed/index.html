		<description><![CDATA[Possibly there are omega 3 reseviors in the body, making the 2/3 T difference less marked. (as opposite tk wen starting). Reseviors can also work by different routes (like improvements in stability of other systems etc.)]]></description>

Do you think the Nobel Committe could do better than this?  They don&#039;t seem to have a great hit-rate overall; it would be interesting to look into just how many awards look dubious in hindsight.]]></description>

Marshall did not get an ulcer from his ingestion of the bacteria he says cause ulcers. And almost everyone who is infected with those bacteria doesn&#039;t get an ulcer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, but the subject should not have a versted interest in a particular outcome.  If you give subjects either a real drug or a placebo they cannot jinx the result by &lt;i&gt;wanting&lt;/i&gt; the effect to arise because if the sample-size is large enough then that corrupting motive will be equally represented in both the drug and placebo samples.  I think it also helps if the subjects aren&#039;t the experimenters.  But in blazingly clear-cut cases, like that guy who uncovered the true cause of ulcers, the results are too compelling to write off as bias and are easily repeatable/falsifiable.   

How did you eliminate the problem of bias in your original studies?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[G, I wasn&#039;t clear. I did this research to find the best dose of flaxseed oil. That flaxseed oil improved my brain function I had established to my satisfaction long ago. I would have preferred the opposite result (no difference) because it would have meant I needed less flaxseed oil. I live in Beijing, where good flaxseed oil is hard to get.
Almost no human psychological research has been done using tasks done for their own sake. Subjects are paid or doing it to satisfy a course requirement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would be super-cautious about drawing wide conclusions from this kind of research because you&#039;re not performing the task for its own sake: in your brain there are connections between the task and the experimental context.  Maybe you produce the link because you want there to be a link, even though you may think you&#039;re making the same degree of effort each time.]]></description>
