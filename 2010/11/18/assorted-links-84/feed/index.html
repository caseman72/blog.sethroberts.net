		<description><![CDATA[hard to say with frazier.  clearly bad to plagiarize, but when i look at the actual examples cited in the article, it looks like he plagiarized what is essentially stock text and put it forward as his own.  he&#039;s taking credit for other people&#039;s words, but is he taking credit for their ideas?    i know that happens too, and it&#039;s not called plagiarism.  what exactly is it called?  it seems like that should be regarded as worse, but is it?

i know that when i did research and wrote papers in mathematics i would often need to reiterate a standard argument -- often i couldn&#039;t rely on the audience the paper was geared toward knowing it.  i wouldn&#039;t always cite a reference if the reference was, say, &quot;any graduate-level algebra text&quot;.  and i wouldn&#039;t have been surprised if i did it in the same way as a text i had read before.  there&#039;s only so much eloquence to go around.

also, i bet that _a lot_ of people stole little bits of text here and there before it became easy to find out about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;As anyone who has worked with him knows, he is ...not a detail person&#039;&#039;: then he&#039;s not a scientist.

P.S. Is that really the same Harvard that&#039;s been giving an easy ride to the monkey chap?]]></description>
