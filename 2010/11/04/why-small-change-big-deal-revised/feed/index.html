		<description><![CDATA[One reason it matters so much: passing a threshold for all-or-nothing activities.  If I could jump 5% higher, I might be able to dunk a basketball (ok, this is not true of me but it is of somebody).  Dunking is an activity that is yes/no.  If my kid had 5% quicker reaction times, he might be a striker instead of a defender.

I bet there are things like this in non-sports life all the time.  If I could think 5% more quickly, that might make me comfortable enough with my speaking that I would be willing to challenge someone smart in a group with me who says something I disagree with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The effect of butter is so large and fast I find it hard to believe it is due to a micronutrient, such as Vitamin K2. But time will tell.

Have I considered high vitamin butter oil? thanks for the suggestion. to answer your question: not explicitly. So far I haven&#039;t tried even one variation. I&#039;m trying to figure out why my reaction time became much lower soon after I returned to China.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Butter is high in Vitamin K (K2) which is being studied in greater detail as of late and could be involved in a host of processes that contribute to greater health overall.  

Stephan&#039;s blog has some of the soundest Vitamin K related posts around, if it can reverse arterial calcification and improve the pathways for absorption of other critical nutrients, perhaps it can results in a slightly sharper and better functioning brain:

		<description><![CDATA[Curious that you didn&#039;t think to mention that the WAPF folks believe that this important nutrient in butter is vitamin K2 (see http://www.westonaprice.org/abcs-of-nutrition/175-x-factor-is-vitamin-k2.html). 

In terms of your testing, have you considered trying high vitamin butter oil instead of the copious amounts of butter?]]></description>
