		<description><![CDATA[GonÃ§alo, I believe that a common cause of depression and anxiety is a messed-up mood rhythm  This rhythm is generated by an internal oscillator with a 24-hour cycle that controls our mood. 

To work properly this oscillator needs:

1. exposure to sunlight in the early morning
2. no fluorescent light late at night.
3. exposure to faces in the early morning, 
4. no exposure to faces late at night.

If any of the four is missing it doesn&#039;t work. And when it doesn&#039;t work you are at greater risk of depression.

You can read more about this in Example 2 of my long self-experimentation paper:

		<description><![CDATA[HI 

My name is GonÃ§alo and I&#039;m from Portugal.

I really like your blog so that&#039;s why I thought about asking you a question.

I have struggled with  strong chronic anxiety and some depression for a long time. I&#039;m 23. 

I would like to ask you if you have any suggestion about what I can do to to try to understand if these syntoms have roots in nutritional deficiencies, infections, inflammation, etc. I have
some history of trauma but maybe some of this is aggravating the problem?

Are there some probable causes? Any tests I shoud do? cost-effective Solutions?

Thanks so much

Warmest wishes 

GonÃ§alo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Professor Roberts:

After reading your blog for some time, last year I started flaxseed oil (2TBSP).  After one year, my total blood cholesterol went down (206 to 194), HDL increased and triglycerides decreased (110 to 55).  Exercise and diet remained constant year over year, except that 6 months ago I began large amounts of butter and one Greek yogurt a day. 

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Darrin
Enzymes are proteins...(DNA makes RNA makes protein).  Some enzymes are constitutive (made all the time in fairly stable amounts because they are needed for routine, house-keeping functions), while others are inducible (the amount that is made depends on how much is needed for special functions). 
 
If all the proteins a cell could make were made all the time, the cell would run out of space and/or not be very efficient.  

This is pretty easy to demonstrate in bacteria.  They prefer to use glucose, but when there is no glucose left in their medium, but there&#039;s some lactose, they will turn on the genes that make the enzyme that breaks down lactose.  If you add glucose back to their diet, they turn off the lactose-digesting genes and return to glucose fermentation.

We do this too.  If you feed a diet high in protein, there is an increase in enzymes that degrade amino acids in the liver, as long as the influx of amino acids continues.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. Conventional wisdom out here in fix-autism-with-nutrition-land is to go with fish oil and evaluate based on DHA count and processing method. (Yay Kirkman!)

The story behind it is roughly the same except that kids with Autism are bad a converting ALA to DHA/EPA.

I&#039;d like to know where the notion came from that you &quot;build up&quot; enzymes by requiring them over time. I hadn&#039;t that before. Is it common knowledge?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two tablespoons of flaxseed oil a day has completely eliminated my dandruff. Two tablespoons of cod liver oil did not (nor did two tablespoons of olive oil or of butter). I have no idea why this might be the case, but for me, at least, flaxseed oil provides something the others do not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No reason to debate this. Take a omega 6/omega 3 ratio blood test and you will know what works for you.

I take such a test every six months. My last test was 2.85 to 1.  2 to 1 is ideal so I am close enough. i take fish oil and I eat omega 3 eggs. Omega 3 eggs are made by feeding chickens flax seed. A chicken body is better at converting ALA than mine is.

Your experience may differ.]]></description>
