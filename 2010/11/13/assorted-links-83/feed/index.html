		<description><![CDATA[Should you be searching out or talking about pasture butter, which is high in omega-3 fatty acids? Or cultured butter, which is normal in Europe but unusual in the US, which is filled with living cultures? Culture butter is easy to make -- take cream, add a dollop of yogurt and leave on the counter for a day or two or three, then churn. Then you get real buttermilk, too, a lovely thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If there was confirmation bias, it makes the results -- which were opposite to the direction in which confirmation bias would push them -- more impressive.

&quot;what a pathetic excuse for a scientist&quot;: well, I&#039;m impressed that an undergraduate did such interesting research. I don&#039;t care if he had preexisting ideas about what the results would be. That&#039;s the usual state of affairs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting how disappointed the researcher was that the meat images didn&#039;t make people aggressive.

So he&#039;s off to craft another study where he can try to cure the defect.

What a pathetic excuse for a &#039;scientist.&#039;  Confirmation bias, anyone?]]></description>
