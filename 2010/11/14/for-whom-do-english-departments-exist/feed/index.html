		<description><![CDATA[I graduated from PSU in June of 1976, so maybe my anecdote is way out of date. But I remember being repeatedly laughed at by my English professors when I said I wanted to write for a living. They said it was simply impossible and I should give up the idea. (I got the idea from my father who was a professional writer). 

They told me I would have to be a teacher because that was the only profession open to young women who were literate + college grads. The pressure was so great that even when I went to the CA State employment office, they said they would only send me to teacher interviews even though I had experience as an executive secretary to a TV star and had worked on a newspaper. Under pressure to support my elderly parents, I caved in and became a teacher, hated it, then became an adult education instructor which I like better, but not much.

Now I am planning to retire. I have written a book for college students telling about all of the things that neither parents nor colleges like to tell them about college. I am saving my money to self-publish it. It is called: College Crazy And How Not To Be. It includes a chapter on how to drop out. And another chapter called, &quot;They&#039;ll Call It Credit; You&#039;ll Call It Debt.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I don&#039;t know who the writer contacted. The article is unclear. Perhaps by &quot;the English department&quot; he or she meant a professor in the English department. Perhaps he or she contacted the chairman of the department. Who knows? Sure, it would be better to contact a professor than a bureaucrat. But to complain the writer didn&#039;t know the best possible procedures is like Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers blaming the guy who got kicked out of Reed because his mom didn&#039;t return a form. Someone else would have known what to do, said Gladwell.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep, as Edward Thorndike said, the problem with anecdotes is that you don&#039;t know the back story leading up to the observation. I concur with q and Alex on this one. It&#039;s very bad form to draw general statements from an anecdote. Anecdotes can be incredibly helpful in suggesting what to look for but not for confirming what you found.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I contacted the English department about creating an independent study...&quot;  Well there&#039;s your mistake, right there.  You need to contact a professor (preferably someone who already knows &amp; likes you) to get tentative approval.  Only &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; do you approach the bureaucrats.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[at the school i went to (huge midwest state school) i&#039;m sure he would have got either answer depending on who he asked, how he asked, and what mood (or how busy) the person he asked was in.  i asked a lot of profs for independent study (including in the english dept, and i wasn&#039;t a major) and and got both kinds of answers depending on differing factors.  and unsurprisingly, it&#039;s been the same story after university -- sometimes people say yes, sometimes people say no.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, there are lots of questions here--not all English departments are alike, not all professors would have treated him &quot;like a mental patient,&quot; and some institutions are more flexible in response to students&#039; requests.  At my alma mater, a small liberal arts college, I had student directed tutorials with professors from the first year, including both theoretical and practical projects (designing and implementing a social survey, ethnography, communication theory).  Most universities now offer various kinds of classes--one of my former students is now screenwriting and wants to incorporate ideas he developed in my class into his screenplays and filmmaking (this at the University of Michigan).]]></description>
