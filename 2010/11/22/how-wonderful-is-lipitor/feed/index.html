		<description><![CDATA[Wayne, do you know if the statins you take are lowering your IQ? See the previous comment. Cholesterol lowering has been associated with more death from suicide and accidents. If this association is due to cause and effect, it implies that cholesterol lowering makes your brain function worse. Suicide rate and accidental death rate are very insensitive measures of brain function, more sensitive measures of brain function might show a strong association.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth-

I recently stopped taking Zocor [a statin, like Lipitor]. I started taking it at the same time I started using a CPAP machine to treat sleep apnea. While my sleep was more restful, I remained fatigued. After a year of Zocor, I was diagnosed with ADHD. Following this diagnosis, I tried a string of medications - adderall, stratera, and ritalin. I even became depressed and was put on an SSRI. My memory and mental prowess faded and became extremely spotty at best. I would use IQ apps on my iPhone to measure my mental prowess -- and usually scored in the 75-100 range! (Prior to Zocor, similar, computerized IQ tests would yield answers from the 130s to the 170s.) Even moderate exercise would wipe me out for days - unless I was taking the maximum dosage of adderall.

So I quit taking Zocor. (Initially, I tried using COQ10 to moderate the effects, but it proved ineffective.) Even though I am obese, I can now exercise in moderation with no ill effects. My mind is back, as are my computerized IQ scores. I no longer arbitrarily stop talking in the middle of sentences after losing my train of thought.]]></description>
