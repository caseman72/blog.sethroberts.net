		<description><![CDATA[This like my favorite Polish joke.

---

Stan and Lev are walking home from an evening out, a bit unsteadily. Stan spots a little frog by the side of the road, and says, &quot;Lev, I&#039;ll bet you five zlotys you won&#039;t swallow that frog.&quot;

Lev is thinking how he has spent too much, and how an extra five zlotys in his pocket would make for an easier morning at home. He snatches the frog and gulps it down. Stan hands over the money, and they walk on.

As they walk, Lev imagines he feels the frog jumping in his stomach. He starts to resent having been tricked into swallowing a frog. After a few minutes, he spots another frog, just a little bigger, and says, &quot;Stan, I&#039;ll bet you five zlotys you won&#039;t swallow that frog.&quot;

Stan is thinking that he really hadn&#039;t expected Lev to swallow the frog, and that he really couldn&#039;t spare the money. He swallows the frog. Lev hands back the five zlotys, and they walk on, each lost in his own thoughts.

A few minutes later, Lev turns to his friend and says, &quot;Stan, why did we swallow those frogs?&quot;

---

I gather that &quot;swallow a frog&quot; sounds really funny in Polish.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You could make the same argument for the US re: GDP.

I think it also illustrates the confusion of cause and effect in economics. It seems the current administration and many before it, believe that consumption drives economic growth (&quot;go out and spend and help the economy&quot;). It&#039;s economic growth, through savings and production that drives consumption.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, China cares too much about GDP. Whenever I watch the Chinese news, they constantly talk about how the GDP is improving.

GDP is a flawed measure. I wrote an article in 2008 about the flaws of GDP:

		<description><![CDATA[Paul, this joke reflects the common belief that the government cares too much about GDP and too little about living standards. For example, a lot of Chinese GDP involves infrastructure -- building roads for example. A little-used road contributes little to living standards. So it is complicated. A well-used road contributes a lot to living standards in the future.]]></description>
