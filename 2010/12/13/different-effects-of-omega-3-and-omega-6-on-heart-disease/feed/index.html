		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Susan, thanks for your comment. I don&#039;t know what you mean by confounding (&quot;confounding the effects of omega-3s and omega-6s&quot;). In experiments (such as the data analyzed by Ramsden et al.) confounding is changing two things at once. In surveys (such as what Willett et al. do), the only use of &quot;confounding&quot; I know about is the idea of unrecognized confounders -- meaning something that wasn&#039;t measured is correlated with something that was measured. But Willett et al. measured both omega-3 and omega-6 consumption so that didn&#039;t happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[The group at Harvard has been confounding the effects of omega-3s and omega-6s for decades. We absolutely require omega-6s in our diet (on that we all agree) but that robust inverse association b/n omega-6s and heart disease would disappear if omega-3s and omega-6s were properly controlled for (as it is in the current study by Ramsden et al.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The &quot;Israeli Paradox&quot; is an ecologic study without much ability to separate the effect of omega-6.  In fact, Israeli arabs who consume tons of olive oil and little omega-6 have higher rates of heart disease than Jewish Israelis who consume omega-6.  Other studies have shown that countries that have shifted their cooking oil to omega-6 rich unsaturated fats tend to witness decreases in heart disease relative to countries that have not (e.g., in eastern europe).  Also, rigorous epidemiologic studies show a robust inverse association between omega-6 consumption and heart disease, which is evident no matter how you slice the data, and is particular strong among the young (see the work from Willett&#039;s lab at Harvard).  Obviously, there may still be residual confounding, but this data certainly doesn&#039;t support that omega-6 is particularly harmful.]]></description>
