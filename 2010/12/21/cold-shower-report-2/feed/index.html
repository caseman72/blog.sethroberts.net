		<description><![CDATA[In the Four Hour Body, Tim recommends a regimen quite different than what I did. Cronise, from whom Tim got the idea, started like this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He drank a gallon of ice water between waking and 11 A.M.; he slept with no covers; he took midwinter â€œshiver walksâ€ of 20â€“30 minutes with nothing but a T-shirt, earmuffs, and gloves on his upper body. He later found less painful options, but the results were undeniable. He lost almost six pounds in the first week.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I took a 4 or 5 minute cold shower daily -- that&#039;s all. I am not sure they caused weight gain but my weight started going up shortly after I started them and started going down soon after I stopped them. Tim&#039;s milder recommendation is to use an ice-pack on the back of the neck for 30 minutes. Perhaps cooling the blood going to the brain (ice pack) is quite different than cooling all of your skin (what I did).]]></description>

maybe it was a residual effect from being more connected to the earth&#039;s electrical potential ?
You could test this by walking barefoot over wet gras (morning dew) and see if you have the same effects.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
Since you have a masochistic streak, you might try sleeping on the floor (i.e. with only a yoga mat or carpet for padding). I started that a while back to address some lower back pain and kept it up even after the back pain went away. I&#039;d be interested to if you find any measurable effects. All I can say is that I ended up kind of liking it (and in fact I should start doing it again). Unlike you, I&#039;m too lazy and disorganized to collect the necessary data (mood is too hard for me to quantify, for example).

As I just got into terms with Tim Ferriss (4hourbody) experiments that cold water makes the body loose fat more quickly.
Did I get it wrong?

		<description><![CDATA[I started taking cold showers during a period where I was getting very little sleep.  I found them to be kind of addictive, refreshing and a nice surrogate for a cup of coffee before leaving the house.  I&#039;ve always been a believer that taking a splash in a body of cold water is one of the most invigorating and natural human enterprises.  A short swim in cold water also happens to erase a hangover.  Never noticed any weight gain.

In the coldest months of winter I usually find they don&#039;t have the same appeal.  But from May-September I probably could count on one hand the number of hot showers I take.]]></description>
