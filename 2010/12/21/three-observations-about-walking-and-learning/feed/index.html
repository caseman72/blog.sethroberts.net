		<description><![CDATA[Hal, I can&#039;t get access to the whole Goucher College article. But I wonder if it assumes that interventions effective in the lab also work outside the lab. In lab experiments, of course, the subjects (students) have to study the to-be-learned material. An unpleasant method of study may be more effective than a pleasant method of study in the lab but outside the lab pleasantness matters and a student may be less likely to do an unpleasant method. When the student predicts &quot;wrongly&quot; the effectiveness of Method X, it may be that the student, unlike the author of that article, is taking pleasantness into account.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you say that &quot;large non-obvious effects&quot; for enhancing learning/memory just haven&#039;t been discovered.  This in-press paper that I just ran across today presents some of the first serious data I have seen about what learning-method recommendations are and are not obvious.  The paper concludes that a number of effective interventions are not obvious at all to the average person  (or at least to the average Goucher College student) :

Effect size is another issue--I think the effect sizes are often pretty large, but that&#039;s a more complicated discussion...]]></description>
