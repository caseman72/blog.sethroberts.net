		<description><![CDATA[I believe walking improves brain function because of, well, danger. 

Think of our ancestors walking in the forest full of hostile creatures: they had to be super-alert all the time, and after the trek for food find their way back.

		<description><![CDATA[This is obvious to me so it is nice to see others thinking and researching this phenomenon.  People pace when they think because it increases the effectiveness.  I have been doing it my whole life.  I speculate this accomplishes two things.  One, greater blood flow which probably helps the brain.  Two, if the brain and body are occupied in motion, the brain may be less distracted than otherwise.]]></description>
