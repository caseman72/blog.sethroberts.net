		<description><![CDATA[The notion of a drug safety and efficacy trial being conducted by someone who says he knows what the results will be is obscene. That the drug will be given to children makes it doubly obscene. That Biederman got millions for this sort of thing and failed to report it merely confirms what a horrible person he is. That Harvard lets him do this speaks volumes about Harvard. This is far worse than plagiarism and making up data (both of which Harvard tolerates, at least with its faculty).]]></description>
