		<description><![CDATA[If the &quot;aquatic ape&quot; meme (not a theory) had not been picked up and promoted, we would all  be better off.  So, not a good example.

Perhaps a better example: plasma fluid dynamics is mathematically intractable, so astrophysicists go out of their way to avoid any hypothesis that might require doing any.  Every observation has to be explained by gravitation alone, or it becomes unfashionable to mention at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The decline effect is another good reason to push for open-data requirements. These requirements not only hold professional scientists to a higher standard of accountability but also allow outsiders to use existing experimental data to develop unorthodox hypotheses and, sometimes, to challenge orthodox beliefs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;I conclude that both science and journalism will work best with systems where amateurs and professionals both have substantial power.&lt;/em&gt;

I think that an amateur can be subject to pressure, just like any professional. More so, actually. No conventional journalist would have gotten the kind of heat Assange has gotten: other journalists would have stepped in.

You may have the cause and effect backward. People who refuse to &quot;fit in&quot;  are less likely to become fully recognized professionals.  Could Assange have gotten a job at the New York Times?]]></description>
