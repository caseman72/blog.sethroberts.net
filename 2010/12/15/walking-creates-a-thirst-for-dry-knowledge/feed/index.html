		<description><![CDATA[I noticed a similar thing. Before exams I now always wander through the woods (many paths, not many people, so distractions are not too numerous). I started off with flashcards and quickly discovered the &quot;few at a time&quot;-rule. By now I use the Mental Case iPhone App (no affiliation). It does a similar thing and repeats only a few cards until you get them right, although it switches them out one by one.

I think it has to do with giving the moving parts of my body something to do while my brain can concentrate on information. I get really restless after a few minutes of dry learning while sitting, but a three-hour walk per day does wonders to my marks and is still pleasant.

I can&#039;t compare it to a treadmill though, as I don&#039;t have one and don&#039;t want to learn in a gym.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of the rocking motion you see Jewish and Islamic students adopting whilst reciting/memorising scripture - always appeared to me to be a adaptive response to the unnaturally static mental and physical intellectual experience. If you want to go down that route, of course, there&#039;s also a possible link to the kind of rocking / repetitive movements you see in traumatised children / animals kept in cages. Walking sounds like a much less maladative response to me! I&#039;m gonna give it a try.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if it is true or not, but I heard once that Mao Zedong taught his soldiers to read by pinning characters to the back of each soldier. Each soldier know the meaning for their word and tell it to the soldier behind them. While marching each soldier would be reading the symbol in front of them over and over.  Rote learning at it&#039;s finest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a great motivational read for me. I&#039;m moving to Beijing in 4 months and I&#039;ve been trying to stick with a program whether it be Rosetta Stone, Live Mocha or the many Mandarin books I have, but it gets old for me really quickly. This is something I can do while on the bike at the gym to help the time go by and hopefully help me pick up my Chinese a bit faster. Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s something about the rhythm of movement  that helps to cut out distraction and set the right frame of mind for learning. I&#039;ve found reading on an exercise bike is fantastic, but never tried it with language learning (I memorised most of the Japanese katakana, but it was so boring!).

Will definitely try this one]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suspect that there&#039;s a strong natural-selection benefit to being aware of your surroundings, to quickly taking in new territory â€“ threats? food sources? â€“ and to detecting changes in familiar territory. Since walking is what would have exposed early humans to their surroundings, we can predict that walking would have, over time, evolved to engage the brainâ€™s capacity to observe, store, recall, and compare.

To continue this line of thinking, when walking outside, this capacity would be put to its intended use. We wouldn&#039;t notice it because, operating as evolved, it would feel completely normal. But when walking on a treadmill, this capacity would be engaged but unused and, we might predict, foster a sense of boredom.

This hypothesis explains why flash cards â€“ something to observe, store, recall, and compare â€“ would seem so fulfilling on the treadmill: this engaged but previously unused capacity is finally given an outlet.

One interesting experiment would be to control for exercise effects by comparing walking to, say, low-intensity bicycling for flash-card memorization. Since bicycling is something we would not expect to have been part of human evolution, we would expect it to be less effective than treadmill-walking for this purpose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps you&#039;ve seen or posted on this before (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdheWK7u11w), but your description of how you learn you characters reminded me of this clip that I&#039;d seen in the past from Alexander Arguelles about one of this language learning techniques. Similar mechanisms at work here? 

Thanks for the interesting post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I walk about 2.5 miles per hour. I haven&#039;t tried Rosetta Stone. Because the whole thing has become enjoyable there&#039;s no need (yet) for things that make it more pleasant, such as picture and sound.

Flashcards allow a really clear sense of accomplishment plus later testing and recording (I can mark on the flashcard itself how well I did). I thought Anki would be an improvement over flashcards but now I think the ease of use of flashcards compensates for the several advantages of Anki. An ipad app with continuous high-quality feedback would be good. I haven&#039;t come across a language-learning program with good feedback. Anki has terrible feedback.]]></description>

I find it much more useful than simple flash cards since it involves more of the senses and is well done. It would be hard to pull off with a laptop, but treadmill + rosetta stone would be interesting. A well executed ipad app would probably work better.]]></description>
