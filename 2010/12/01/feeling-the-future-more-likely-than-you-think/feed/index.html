		<description><![CDATA[CTB,  yes, that&#039;s true. I&#039;m trying to say why Bem&#039;s experiments should not be quickly dismissed. Galvani&#039;s experiments showed how psychology (or at least study of the nervous system) could be helpful to physics. If the future can affect the present that is new physics. Before Galvani, people knew about static electricity. They just couldn&#039;t study it well. It was just a strange thing. I think everyone knows that gravity has an ordering effect (things in different places are drawn to the same place) and the passage of time has a disordering effect, but what to make of that opposition, if anything, hasn&#039;t been clear. It is just a strange thing. Perhaps there is some relation to Bem&#039;s results, just as static electricity and other easily-noticed phenomena (such as lightning) turned out to be related to Galvani&#039;s results.

Joe and Henrico, thank you for your comments. You make good points. I hope to discuss this with a physicist....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry...by &#039;the point of all this&#039; I meant I don&#039;t see the connection between the billiard ball thought experiment (requires untrue assumption that the balls exert enough gravitational force on each other to pull them together, overcoming the opposing air movements) and the Bem experiments which produced real effects without any untrue assumptions being made.  

But I think you&#039;re trying to say: the Bem experiments produced real effects, and these results might be demonstrating that precognition is possible...so, let&#039;s think about some other reasons to believe that precognition is possible.

		<description><![CDATA[I tend to agree with Henrico on the gravity/time symmetry...

The example of the billiard balls is not actually one case being run back and forth in time; it&#039;s two non-equivalent cases.  Case 1 involved the air molecules being more powerful than gravity, and pushing the balls apart as time moves forward.  Case 2 involved gravity being more powerful than air molecules and pulling the balls together as time moves forward.  If you run Case 1 &quot;backward&quot; (start the balls apart and run time backwards) the air molecules will not push the balls together, they will continue to move the balls around randomly.  If you run Case 2 backward (start the balls together and run time backwards) gravity will hold the balls together.  In Case 1 gravity is explicitly weaker than the air molecules, in Case 2 gravity is explicitly stronger.  In either case there is no gravity/time symmetry, only the special situation where you have â€œCase 1 rulesâ€ (gravity weaker than air) as time moves forward and â€œCase 2 rulesâ€ (gravity stronger than air) as time moves backward.

I think it&#039;s more helpful to think of time as a dimension (length, width, depth, timeâ€¦) and gravity as a force (gravity, electromagnetism, lift, dragâ€¦).  Events are caused by forces and measured relative to dimensions.  Some events are conservative in time and space, tossing a ball in the air for example, and there is force-force symmetry IN time with those events (gravity is symmetrical, in time, with the projectile force sending the ball into the air).  Some events are non-conservative in time, like the â€œdrinking coffeeâ€ example, and so in those instances there is no force-force symmetry in time.

This is a very interesting line of thought and I&#039;m looking forward to the rest of the posts, but I think there is a lot more work to do to establish the validity of a time/gravity symmetry.  Or maybe I&#039;m missing a subtler point that someone can point outâ€¦]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Entropy is the tendency for a system to move from order to disorder due to the random disturbances you mentioned in the ball example.  The force of gravity can counteract entropy...otherwise, for example, the planets in our solar system would not be orbiting around the sun, they&#039;d be moving off into the cosmos.  

If the balls were heavy enough to exert gravitational pull on each other and move together, they would be using the force of gravity to overcome the force of entropy.  If you filmed this happening, then played it in reverse, it would look like &#039;time in reverse&#039; but the reverse film would be an impossibility in reality unless you put in some sort of energy to make it happen.  

I.e., only one of the directions happens spontaneously (depending on which force is bigger), and that is the direction which corresponds with time moving forward.  

Also looking forward to the point of all this....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Henrico, that&#039;s a nice way of looking at it. Suppose there are just two particles in an enclosed space and the only important force is the force of gravity. When you run time forward, the two particles move closer, due to attraction. When you run time backward, they move further apart, due to repulsion (gravity in reverse). In the second case, however, the increase in information (predictability of location) is very slight because the particles are already far apart and are at random locations. Those locations become only slightly less random if the enclosure is large enough. 

More concretely if you have a bunch of randomly-placed particles in an enclosed space and you run time backwards with just gravity as a repulsive force they will appear to be moving randomly, as far as I can tell. The build up of information is far clearer when time goes forward. Then gravity will cause them to clump together. Their locations will become perfectly correlated.

In other words, I am not so sure the operation of gravity causes information (predictability of location) to increase when time runs backward. If information is defined as correlation of location, then with two particles, yes, they become negatively correlated due to repulsion. But as the number of particles increases the effect -- increase in negative correlation due to repulsion -- becomes weaker and weaker.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you start with a random distribution of particles, running the laws of physics forward or backwards will both look &quot;normal&quot;.  It is only after the simulation has run for a period that reversing the time direction makes it look funny.  But that effect holds for both (i) starting with +t, and reversing so the equations use -t, and (ii) the opposite, starting with -t, and reversing so the equations use +t.  In both cases, the reversed simulation starts to look normal again when you pass the point of the initial distribution.

This is due to the fact that running the simulation (with +t or -t) creates information that is not random (but reflecting physical law).  The issue is not time direction, but information.

The separation of balls due to random fluctuations is not the mirror image of gravity, and so I&#039;m not following what you are saying, but look forward to your posts on this.]]></description>
