		<description><![CDATA[Alex, the path to wider acceptance is to find out if it is true in other people. I believe that is best done by starting small, the smaller the better. It is a poor idea to do big studies before you have done small studies. That doesn&#039;t mean big studies are bad or unimportant; it means small studies should be done first. Maybe my preference for starting small is why you interpreted earlier comments by me as &quot;downplaying the importance of replicating [my] results&quot; which is not true at all. I think it is very important to learn to what extent the results can be repeated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, what do you see as the path from your (or anyone&#039;s) initial self-experimentation all the way to acceptance by the larger scientific community?  In previous comments, you seem to have down-played the importance of replicating your results -- or, at least, of scaling-up studies to use larger sample sizes.  So... where is one to go after discovering something new in oneself?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark, thanks, I didn&#039;t know about that.

&quot;the random timing of the big benefits strengthens the motivation.&quot; Good point. Learning psychologists such as me know very well that partial reinforcement (e.g., rewarding only 25% of bar presses) produces great resistance to extinction than 100% reinforcement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Data collection always seems like such a lot of work to me. You explained very well why people do it. It reminds me of my own twisted relationship with Google Reader. Except theres a large chance I read mostly mundane stuff. There&#039;s always those times where I learn something really interesting or useful. Not too often but enough to keep me, what, addicted? I&#039;ll never admit to that.

I expect that the random timing of the big benefits strengthens the motivation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

I love your approach of self-experimentation and I&#039;m a big advocate for it.

I don&#039;t know if the relationship between male testosterone levels and abstinence has been brought to your attention. People who abstain report improved brain function, strength, mood, overall energy and focus. A Chinese study found that men&#039;s T peaked after 7 days post-ejaculation [the study seems to have stopped soon after, there is no data it seems regarding abstaining for longer periods].

Similar to your SLD forums, there is this massive forum thread in which hundreds of guys testify to these effects:

http://www.sosuave.net/forum/showthread.php?s=060780d57fe8bcad7e90e782d797c32c&amp;t=20053

It would be great if you could give this topic attention. Many people dismiss it since it doesn&#039;t go well with popular belief, but in my opinion the experimental evidence of all of these forum posters is too much to ignore.]]></description>
