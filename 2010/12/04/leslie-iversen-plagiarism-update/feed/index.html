		<description><![CDATA[This could reasonably be an honest mistake, although if so it points to carelessness. But the claim that &quot;Apparently undergraduate plagiarism is a big problem at Oxford&quot; implies that plagiarism is a bigger problem in Oxford than elsewhere. This I doubt. One lecturer at another university has said to me that she routinely gets essays blatantly copied from intenet sources, complete with embedded HTML codes clearly identifying the source - students do not even bother to paste-as-text. This is because we ask students to produce, not think. In my own teaching I ask for short essays on non-standard topics, and have yet to detect any evidence of plagiarism. The students seem to prefer those tasks as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is one honest mistake scenario I am afraid will sometime happen to me. When I research for longer works, I usually paste longish quotes (with references or links next to them) right into the draft. When it&#039;s a Google Document being edited together by many people, or simply a long and complex document, things get moved around a lot. I can easily see how a piece may land somewhere separate from its reference.

What I don&#039;t understand is the lack of communication and transparency. If an honest mistake is made, why not tell the world what it was, why it happened, and what you are doing to prevent it?]]></description>
