		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if the increased thermogenesis would be conducive to weight loss.

I also wonder if doing this repeatedly would cause you to grow (metabolically active brown fat.

		<description><![CDATA[Submerging in snow is a part of the traditional Russian steam bath routine. First, you gradually raise the temperature and humidity inside (this part is somewhat similar to Native American ceremonies) while drinking kvass or beer to sustain electrolytes. You use specially aged and soaked birch branches with leaves to gently beat yourself all over - this opens up pores and does some complex things to circulation. When you are VERY hot, you go out and roll in the snow, or just splash yourself with a tub of cold water in the next room. Amazingly, the sensation is extremely pleasant. The cooling is welcome and it does not feel like a shock. Then you can go back to the steam room for more, repeating the cycle a few times.

Needless to say, every step can go pretty wrong if you don&#039;t know what you are doing. For example,  raising the temperature or humidity too abruptly will most definitely cause cardiovascular problems. Applying too much strength with branches will not feel painful, but you will get scars. I would strongly advise learning from someone experienced before trying any of this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A monk at a temple in Japan told me they do a cold water meditation.  They douse themselves in cold water then sit for hours.  He said the experienced monks knew to get the bucket of water ice cold if possible because the body would warm strongly and dry out their robes.  The novices tried to use warmer water and ended up shivering in wet robes.  This was 20 years ago so I don&#039;t remember the details.  Google says I might have heard of shinto misogi or been at the Kamakura temple.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, there must be thousands of middle-aged men who were, like me, seventh--graders when Ian Fleming&#039;s Bond novels came out in paperback in 1962, driven by President Kennedy&#039;s enthusiasm for them.  Since we could neither shake nor stir Martinis, nor even touch girls, or drive Aston Martins, the only thing Bond did that we could do, we did; take a cold shower every day.
There were no discernible effects.
Yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s one more option to try, besides hot and cold showers, and that&#039;s a hot shower with about 5 seconds of cold water at the end - just enough to undo the increase in body temperature from the hot water. I&#039;ve found this leaves me feeling more energetic then regular hot showers, at least for the 30 minutes or so immediately after.]]></description>
