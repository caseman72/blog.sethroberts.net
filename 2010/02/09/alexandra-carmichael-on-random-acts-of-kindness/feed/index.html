		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Seth.  I suppose it&#039;s also possible for people to give different names to the same mood effect, based on the kind of frame through which they view the world.  Someone who has a &quot;loneliness&quot; frame may interpret the good feelings that result from helping others as &quot;I feel less lonely when I help others,&quot; while someone else who has a &quot;low self-worth frame&quot; might interpret those same good feelings as &quot;I feel greater self-worth when I help others.&quot;  
That would make it even more difficult to predict the pleasant results that result from something like cooperation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it really being kind when we are, even subconsciously, hoping for something in return?  Real kindness is not fancy. Just responding to someoneâ€™s need with simplicity, without awe at your own charity, without expecting anything in return. In fact, without any sense of self at all.  Kindness says, &quot;I want you to be happy.&quot; 

&quot;Life&#039;s most persistent and urgent question is, What are you doing for others?&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Nadav, yes, humans are cooperative -- so something must push us to cooperate. Somehow it must feel good or produce pleasant results. But predicting what pleasant results it produces is hard. Does it improve happiness, reduce irritability, increase serenity, reduce sensitivity to stress, reduce anxiety, increase feelings of well-being, or what?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;SETH Thanks, Alexandra. Itâ€™s especially interesting that helping others raised your feeling of self-worth. I wouldnâ€™t have guessed it would have that effect.&quot;

Seth, you&#039;ve written that much of your self-experimentation has pointed to the wisdom of returning to our more ancient lifestyles: morning sunlight, fewer ditto foods, stand more, etc.  I speculate this may be another example of that: before the invention of money or the bartering of goods, the main currency of human societies was probably reciprocity.  You simply couldn&#039;t get along in a tribe without contributing to the welfare of others, which in turn ensured they would contribute to your welfare.  By that logic it wouldn&#039;t be surprising that helping others raises your own self-worth, as in a sense you are accumulating &quot;assets.&quot;]]></description>
