		<description><![CDATA[Alex, yeah, that&#039;s a good point. The bacteria is dangerous not because it grows in your body but because of its byproducts. Perhaps that&#039;s why we seem to have a built-in aversion to spoiled food. As I said, I throw it away even though I&#039;m not afraid of it. (I agree with you, I should be afraid of it.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Like you, I&#039;ve never been one to worry about expiration dates, and I&#039;ve been known to eat leftovers that I found in the back of the &#039;fridge and that were well past their prime.  In fact, this is a frequent subject of conflict with my wife, who won&#039;t eat any leftovers that are more than a few days old and who is quite diligent about checking expiration dates.

That having been said, a few months ago I had a pretty serious bout of gastrointestinal illness that I suspect was food poisoning and not the flu.  I never figured out where I got it.  I&#039;m not suggesting that I had botulism, but &lt;i&gt;Clostridium botuinum&lt;/i&gt; doesn&#039;t grow in someone else&#039;s body and yet is quite dangerous if ingested (or, at least its toxin is dangerous).  So I wonder if it&#039;s at least possible that under certain conditions, with certain foods, that spoilage in an of itself, can make the food harmful.  Is there a clinical microbiologist in the house?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I&#039;m not worried about spoilage-related bacteria because I believe that bacteria that prosper in one environment (old food) are going to die in a much different environment (inside my body). I throw away spoiled food, sure, but not because I&#039;m afraid of it. I&#039;m much more afraid of bacteria that have grown successfully in someone else&#039;s body.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s an interesting article about the expiration dates printed on food packages, but I think that this section needs to be explained better: &quot;we should focus our efforts on what really matters to our healthâ€”not spoilage bacteria, which are fairly docile, but their malevolent counterparts: disease-causing pathogens like salmonella and Listeria, which infect the food we eat not because it&#039;s old but as a result of unsanitary conditions at factories or elsewhere along the supply chain.&quot;

Are there no spoilage-associated bacteria which are harmful?  Is it possible that very low levels of disease-causing pathogens can grow exponentially over time and rise to the level where they are dangerous?]]></description>
