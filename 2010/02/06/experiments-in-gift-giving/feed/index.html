		<description><![CDATA[Not so much on the character. I assume you&#039;re referring to the simplified version of huan: æ¬¢ if it comes through. The original character was: æ­¡, which (according to Wenlin) comes from guan4 é›š as a phonetic (from a picture of a heron, but not a character any more), and qian4 æ¬  &quot;breath&quot;, as in ha1qian4 - å“ˆæ¬  - yawn from a picture of a person with their mouth open (in the ancient version of it). So the idea that being short of breath might relate to owing makes a bit of sense. 

If anything, you might want to say that breathing again -&gt; happiness (works for me),  but in etymology and ornithology the &quot;again&quot; probably just has something to do with the sound of the name of a bird.

But the experiment seems like a great idea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even better if the gifts are free or otherwise un-purchased! :)

I practice random acts of kindness, with a goal of helping at least 10 people a day (and at least 1 person I don&#039;t know). I find this helps my mood toward the end of the day, when it is most likely to fall - no matter what else has happened that day, at least I&#039;ve helped 10 people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The word &quot;generosity&quot; comes from the Latin word meaning &quot;of noble birth&quot;. I suppose the idea is that &quot;well born&quot; people are more giving than &quot;low born&quot; people, but then it&#039;s easier to give resources away if you have a monopoly on them to begin with. Then there&#039;s a Veblen aspect...people may give stuff away to prove that they have so much extra money that can afford to give the gifts.]]></description>
