		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
Methinks you give Madonna too much credit. As an attorney (a lawyer representing clients), I find that clients want to be told &quot;we&#039;ll win&quot; and other comforting thoughts, and it&#039;s hard to find a path between pollyannaism and defeatism (which one will be accused of quickly). In this case, I&#039;m suspect that Madonna thought that all her money could buy her the outcome she wanted. It sure does help, but I have to tell my clients: &quot;No guaranties!&quot;, no &quot;slam dunks&quot; (I don&#039;t want to be the local George Tenant). An honest appraisal of prospects? Yes. Certainties? No. I&#039;m as quick to suspect the client in this case as the attorney as the source of faulty expectations. 

As to perverse incentives, the client, who must pay a significant sum, has the incentive to maintain a skeptical attitude and press for honest assessments. However, if you&#039;re rich enough (alas, not my class of clients), the money doesn&#039;t caution you since you have so much of it. Most people would prove more careful with their money.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jim, why do you even bother going to a dermatologist if you don&#039;t want prescriptions and just want to stop using anti-bacterial soaps? The only thing a derm can do is give you prescriptions. 

Lance, are you sure olive oil isn&#039;t a vegetable oil?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LemmusLemmus, sure, there are forces pushing professionals to tell the truth, too. I am saying there are forces (well, one force, self-interest) pushing them to lie. The relative strength of the various forces, who knows? As for shopping around, if everyone in the profession agrees on the untruth -- as dermatologists appear to have done -- you can&#039;t easily find a better specialist.  As far as I know, you can&#039;t easily find a dermatologist who will say that acne is due to diet.

lance, do you have any idea what that &quot;book in the base library&quot; was called? I&#039;d like to look at it.

Jim, why haven&#039;t you tested your idea about harsh anti-bacterial soaps causing dry itchy skin by simply not using them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was serving in Korea, I found a book in the base library (no new books since about the Vietnam War, as far as I could tell) by a dermatologist who had experimented with his patients and discovered that transfats and polyunsaturated fats cause acne. It was only much later when I figured out the differences between the different kinds of fats that I realized he was right, that it&#039;s the prevalence of vegetable fats that causes certain kinds of acne. Now that I eat sardines in olive oil every day, and avoid all the vegetable fats, my acne has gone away after about twenty years. Couldn&#039;t have done it without the internet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But what about reputational effects? Once you find out our doctor/lawyer is clueless or a liar, are you going to bring more business their way? The narrow self-interested stategy makes most sense if the expert expects a one-shot transaction or thinks the customer won&#039;t find out about his (the expert&#039;s) deception.

Empirically, there are anecdotes to counter yours.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s very interesting. In a couple weeks, I will be going to my first-ever dermatologist appointment to discuss my dry, flaky, itchy, red skin, which I think may be caused by harsh anti-bacterial soups.

I was fascinated recently by a blog post called &quot;Paleo I Donâ€™t Care: I Like No Soap; No Shampoo.&quot; on Richard Nikoley&#039;s &quot;Free The Animal&quot; blog. I plan to tell the dermatologist that I want fewer chemicals on/in my body, not a bunch of prescription stuff. It&#039;ll be an interesting appointment.]]></description>
