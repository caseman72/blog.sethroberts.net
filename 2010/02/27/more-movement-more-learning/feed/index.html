		<description><![CDATA[[...] A new blog post by Seth Roberts discusses the theory of movement learning: Five years after my own experience as a third-grade teacher in Illinois, I was training teachers at the University of Washington and received a federally funded grant to conduct research in the Seattle Public Schools. During the 1977 school year, 250 students from four elementary schools studied language arts concepts through movement and dance activities for twenty weeks. The third grade students involved in the study increased their MAT [?] scores by 13 percent from fall to spring, while the district wide average showed a decrease of 2 percent! The primary grade project [?] students also showed a great improvement in test scores. Most significant was the direct relationship the research showed between the amount of movement the classroom teacher used and the percentage increase of studentsâ€™ test scores.

		<description><![CDATA[One of the more overwrought parts of the book Nurtureshock (which I enjoyed, all in all) had to do with the positive impact of role-playing activities on the learning in the young.

On the other hand, the classic lecture in the Agora occurred as the lecturer led people about on a walk.

		<description><![CDATA[sure, i overstated when i said &#039;completely different&#039;.

in your case you changed one thing and you got an effect, so the effect was probably due to that change.

in the kids&#039; case they changed probably hundreds of things and so we could discuss whether one or another of those things was important.  my first assertion / strawman would be that play-acting aids child learning a lot.  it might be difficult to tease this out from movement.  i think it would be difficult to get kids to pay attention to something like math or reading while walking around and if they aren&#039;t paying attention there&#039;s no point.  i suppose my base assertion is that if kids pay attention they will learn.  

desk learning is partially about removing distractions in order to encourage focusing on something.  you have to ask yourself how well this works.  i wouldn&#039;t think it would work that well, but i prefer and have always preferred chaotic environments.

there are other things besides walking that you could think of too.  you could test &#039;i learn better when i talk to myself out loud&#039; or &#039;i learn better when i sing.&#039;  you could do isometric abdominal exercises while sitting at a lecture and see if that helps or hinders learning.  (it would probably help your balance if nothing else.)

on another subject, have you heard of any experiments with eating with your hands and weight loss?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a book I was recommended (though haven&#039;t read yet) called &quot;Smart Moves: Why Learning is not all in your Head&quot; by Carla Hannaford.  

The product description on Amazon says:
&quot;Neurophysiologist and educator Dr. Carla Hannaford brings the latest insights from scientific research to questions that affect learners of all ages. Examining the body&#039;s role in learning, from infancy through adulthood she presents the mounting scientific evidence that movement is crucial to learning.&quot; (and more, but I figure this is enough to establish a connection with what you are talking about).

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;completely different&quot;? No, in both cases adding plenty of movement to a learning task was really helpful. Sure, there are big differences, mainly in the nature of the activity. But it isn&#039;t obvious why walking should be so different than moving around a room. Nor is it obvious why language learning should be so different than the vocabulary and simple-concept learning which is a big part of what third-graders do.

My work sheds a new light on the work that Gilbert describes. It suggests a new explanation: Movement makes kids more curious.

In terms of their effect on the average reader, I suppose, yeah, they are completely different. The subjects (me versus third-graders) are worlds apart and the effects differ greatly in how surprising they are. At least those are the differences that strike me. But I believe the underlying mechanism may be the same.]]></description>
