		<description><![CDATA[Vic, have you been to any other colleges? The This American Life report made Penn State sound different than any of the colleges I&#039;ve had experience with. And quite apart from whether Penn State is much different from other schools, the whole phenomenon of alumni attending football games for decades suggests something powerful is at work. The alumni are incredibly protective of this thing they do; it must mean a lot to them. I&#039;ve been to some of those games. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s because college football is incredibly fun to watch; it surely has something to do with group identity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I would be suspicious about info based on visits to N Korea. If a foreigner visits, he is accompanied by a government escort. If you were a N Korean citizen, you would not want to be the person who said something negative about life in N Korea in front of that government official. 

I have read that China does not like N Koreans sneaking into their country. They send them back. So maybe the half who return are just the ones who got caught.  8-(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The rate of return may not be a good indicator of how well a government is doing its job. Imagine two countries A and K. 10% of citizens of both these countries would prefer to live somewhere else.

In country A, the government doesn&#039;t care a bit about emigration (if government exists in that country at all). The country is mainly producer of agricultural goods, with minimal international trade. Nearest country with substantially better living conditions, country X, is 3000 km away.

In country K, the government is afraid of all its citizens emigrating, and tries to make it as difficult as possible, by issuing passports only to loyal people, for instance. Emigration is portrayed as treason. X is a neigbour country.

Now, in country A (African type) there is no need for people to travel abroad, except emigration. Business travelers are rare, since there are almost no businesses owned by A&#039;s citizens, and to travel 3000 km for pleasure is out of reach for almost all of A&#039;s inhabitants. Therefore, meeting A&#039;s citizen in X, we can expect that he is an emigrant with 99% probability, and the return rate would be in order of 1%.

In country K (Korean type) the people who can travel abroad are workers of government organisations sent on business trips, people from border areas coming to X to do some private business (if there are private businesses in K) and the K&#039;s elite on vacations. Now, meeting K&#039;s citizen in X, the probability that he is an emigrant is much lower.

So we have expected high return rate for A and low for K, whereas the average desire to emigrate can be the same.

If one compares North Korea to African countries (which I assume you&#039;ve done actually), one could be surprised that not all travellers are emigrants. If one compares it to East European communist regimes (which I have done implicitly when reading the post),  one can conclude that if half of the travellers never return, certainly even much of the loyal supporters of the regime betray it when they have an opportunity - and there would be nothing to explain by group identity.

To make sensible analysis, we should take into account rather the ratio of emigration to overall population. Of course, such analysis would be distorted due to different difficulty of emigration from different countries. The return rate seems to overcome this distortion, but it probably brings at least as big own problems.

		<description><![CDATA[David, the dark side of what I&#039;m saying is that perhaps this sort of group identity can develop only in situations where there are winners and losers -- meaning that people who belong to the losing side aren&#039;t happy. I hope not. I&#039;d like to think it can develop around excellence of any sort. Or even something less than excellence, such as competence. As for Raiders games, I used to be a 49ers fan. Watched every game (at home). I enjoyed the games a lot but it didn&#039;t give my life meaning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At UC Berkeley, I&#039;ve always asked students why they didn&#039;t go to a different school they live near.  So far, they have always said something like, &quot;Because Berkeley is better.&quot;  A professor at Cal told me that he works so hard on papers.    I said, &quot;Why?&quot;  He said, &quot;That&#039;s why Berkeley is the best!&quot;  So people at Berkeley feel special, too!  I guess because of the prestige of the school.  I didn&#039;t realize it was prestigious around the world until foreign summer school students told me.  

Today, I asked a former Tsinghua student why Tsinghua accepts a small percentage of students. He said, &quot;There&#039;s a lot of people in China!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bryan, that&#039;s a good point. I think group membership is required for this special mechanism to kick in. You have to convince people they are part of a special group. Telling someone they are special (by themselves) doesn&#039;t work. Perhaps the more special you think you are the LESS this works because the less you feel like joining your inferiors in some big group.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;And not just saying it, but also encouraging it and giving persuasive reasons. 

This seems to be the key. Going to California public schools in the 80s and early 90s, I was subject to my fair share of self-esteem programs, the essential message of which is &quot;You are special&quot;. I can&#039;t say me or my classmates were positively impacted.]]></description>
