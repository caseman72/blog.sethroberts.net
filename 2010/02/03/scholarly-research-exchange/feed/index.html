		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, there are &quot;pseudo-journals,&quot; such as the SRX journals, and there are &quot;real&quot; journals with very low impact factors -- such as many journals. I&#039;m not sure drawing a sharp line between them makes sense. At least the SRX journals are trying something new. If I recall correctly, they reject about half of the submissions.

rps, the company aggregates content (e.g., many neuroscience articles in one place) and organizes the review process. It has about 200 employees.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  If authors are paying $500 per article, I doubt this is the wave of the future or anything like it.  It sounds more like a scam where people can buy publications in pseudojournals and put them as lines on their C.V.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What does this publishing company really do to justify their income? I&#039;m not a scientist, but my dad used to edit a journal and he told me how it worked. He worked for free since it was supposedly prestigious, the authors didn&#039;t get paid anything, and the publisher charged $50 a copy to university libraries.  This may have made sense in those pre-internet days when you had to publish it on dead trees and coordinate with university libraries, but now you could just put it on a website for essentially nothing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Darin,
I suspect you&#039;re right. Here&#039;s a more general formulation of your hypothesis: 

&quot;1) everything thatâ€™s already in the world when youâ€™re born is just normal; 2) anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it; 3) anything that gets invented after youâ€™re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until itâ€™s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.&quot; -- Douglas Adams

		<description><![CDATA[My hypothesis: People aged 33 and above have a irrationally negative view of self published info on the internet. At 50 and above it&#039;s complete taboo. Below those ages people are more likely to filter self published material less stringently. Their mental filters will be equivalent to what I (age 35) would use to filter a radio commercial. There will be no more internet stigma.

The result would be that in three decades it will be acceptable to self publish many results and cheaper for lay people to read primary sources. The scientific community&#039;s &quot;immune system&quot; will have been reinvented into something still very flawed but better than the journals used today.

That&#039;s a falsifiable hypothesis and I&#039;m sticking with it.

Put another way, Journals have been dead for over a decade, except for the fact that other forms of self publishing have been unnaturally stigmatized. I think the stigma will clear and science will find a cheaper way of &quot;blessing&quot; important results.]]></description>
