		<description><![CDATA[Hello seth. I was wondering if you can provide some suggestions regarding Omega 3  Fish oil pills? I  have been delusional for years now but no hallucinations.  I have not been diagnosed yet. Should  I start consuming this natural supplement? I really don&#039;t want to get on anti-psychotic drugs as you  too have  claimed  of them to have severe side-effects. Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am surprised that the notion of using baker&#039;s yeast to fight cancer is being treated as new idea. My layman&#039;s understanding is that for more decades than most of the readers of this blog have been alive, beta glucan, derived from the cell wall of baker&#039;s yeast, has been studied for its apparent ability to boost immunity.

I do not claim to know how effective beta glucan is for such a purpose, but I do gather that this substance is also present in a number of medicinal mushrooms, maitake among them.

Also, health food stores have sold beta glucan pills and mushroom extracts for many years, although some brands are reportedly of much higher quality than others.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Newsweek magazine has a cover story this week about how antidepressants are nothing but glorified placebos:

http://www.newsweek.com/id/232781

Although they work no better than placebo at alleviating depression, they do have adverse physiological effects on the brain.

Here is an excellent article about the dangerous effects of psychotropic drugs:

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,
I have been following your blog for some months now...and have experienced a marked improvement with gum inflammation while using Flaxseed Oil.  When I saw the article on Brewers Yeast, I did some googling that brought me to the Sloan Kettering/Integrative Medicine/Herb site and while I couldnâ€™t find Brewerâ€™s Yeast info,  I did take a look at Flaxseed Oil.  http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/69220.cfm   I was diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer in 2006 and darn-- according to SKCC, flaxseed has phytoestrogenic effects and should be used with caution by ER+ individuals.  Do you think Fish Oil is as effective for inflammation?  I have tried searching your blog for a comparison of the two.  I wonder if there is a comparable â€œdoseâ€ of Fish Oil to the very effective 2 TBS of Flaxseed Oil?  Thanks for your help.]]></description>

Overcome by curiosity, I clicked over here just to see if you had beaten me to the scoop and to seeing the connection. I laughed to see that you had. I&#039;m proud to sport you on my favorites list.]]></description>
