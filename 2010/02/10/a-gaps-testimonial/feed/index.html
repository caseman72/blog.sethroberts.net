		<description><![CDATA[My 16yo son&#039;s asthma has also been almost 100% cured by dietary changes and, oddly, gymnastics. We have cut out almost all sugar (that has been the most difficult part of the diet), eliminated diary (except for kefir from goat&#039;s milk), only eat whole wheat flour, no white flour products at all, no processed foods, take a boatload of vitamins and have started chelation using the Cutler protocol.

One of the biggest changes came when he started doing handstands at home. He watched a Damien Walters video on free running and yearned to do it. After a week of practicing handstands, he had a weekend of something like a cold: stuffed up, coughing (a productive cough which is what you want but rarely get with an asthmatic), tired, but no fever or any other symptoms.

I&#039;m a yoga person and happened to be reading the world&#039;s greatest yoga book (http://tinyurl.com/bestyogabook) and noticed that upside down poses are great for the lungs. I concluded, not very scientifically, that he had dislodged some crap in his lungs... But after this sick weekend and his intense gymnastics workouts (see one here: http://www.abroadincostarica.com/2009/11/ffa.html), his asthma is 99% gone. When I hug him, there is no wheeze. I hear nothing which is a miracle.

I&#039;ve been studying, reading, exploring alternative paths to health since we moved to Costa Rica 4 years ago. I started out looking for ways to help (healing wasn&#039;t even part of my vocabulary back then) Ryan&#039;s asthma. I knew there must be a better way.

I also started out convinced that mercury poisoning from the few vaccinations my kids did was responsible for the asthma and some learning disabilities for my oldest boy. I do still feel there is a connection but maybe just in the gut. Mercury does stay in your body, getting it out is critical for good health, but maybe it does not cause the autism/allergies, etc. Maybe it just creates other problems that then create the a/a... then there is the aluminum, viruses, and other toxins injected with the vaccines.

Today, after treating colds, asthma, cuts, even my dog&#039;s infections, preventing flu, a myriad of evidence piling up around here, I wouldn&#039;t go to a doctor unless I had a broken arm. My husband manages his high blood pressure with magnesium... well, the list is endless.

We have not followed the GAPS diet strictly but basically adhere to it in spite of that! We are all happier and healthier because of our new eating habits.

I found you because I&#039;m starting your diet. I am a firm believer in self-experimentation. Thank you for being out there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you haven&#039;t already found it, this article suggests a link between autism and gastrointenstinal abnormalities.  Essentially, the cause of the unusual development in the brain may also cause unusual development in the enteric nervous system in the gut.  There is also a brief mention of the interaction between the immune system, the enteric nervous system, and bacteria in the gut.  It&#039;s short on detail but full of hints to things you like to write about.  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gut-second-brain]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeff, I worry less about the accuracy of this report than I worry about the accuracy of a scientific article reporting something similar. I don&#039;t worry at all about &quot;something being a coincidence&quot;. I accept that the behavior changes were due to the dietary changes. There are many similar reports to this; nothing rests on the accuracy of just this one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
How much do you worry about self-reporting accuracy in a story like this?  With just one example do you worry about something being a coincidence and that correlation is not actually identifying causation?

A lot of aspects of this account (by Millie) struck me as strange.

		<description><![CDATA[That is a VERY compelling account. Yet another example of how dietary intervention can have profound and positive health consequences. Add this to the list of dietary interventions that have &#039;cured&#039; migraines and EPP (erythropoietic protoporphyria)--see here (http://epistemocrat.blogspot.com/2010/02/ancestral-fitness-bricoleurs-two-e.html), and here (http://pigeonrat.psych.ucla.edu/systems/file_download.aspx?pg=277&amp;ver=1) for the poster.]]></description>
