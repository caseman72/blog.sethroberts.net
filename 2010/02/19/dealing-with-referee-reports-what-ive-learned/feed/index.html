		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Again, the worst behavior by referees is when they are recommending rejections or are simply sitting on papers.  This stuff will not get revealed by publishing reports for accepted papers, generally speaking, unless the editor has overruled them or the author has kowtowed to ridicuous demands (&quot;cite me, me, me, me...!&quot;).  Nobody is going to publish unpublished papers to show the comments on them, nobody.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Barkley, I see your point. That makes sense. But I wonder if it would be like cameras on reality shows: After a while the contestants forget about them. Or at least that is my impression, given how much the contestants embarrass themselves. And perhaps the possibility that their comments might become public would lead to better behavior by editors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

In my comments on MR I noted that the most intense complaints about reports resemble yours, about bad reports that lead to a paper being rejected.  These will not be revealed by publishing the reports of papers that are accepted.  Your Xinhua students may have found errors in published papers (in which case there is an opportunity to write a publishable comment), but do not expect editors under such a system to publish papers with reports whose critical comments have not yet been responded to.

I argued that such a setup will make it less likely that editors will do the brave thing and publish papers that have outstanding critical comments in any report.  Some of the most cited papers I have published in JEBO have had exactly that sort of situation, reports from referees or even associate editors opposing publication.  Maybe publishing these would be interesting, but most editors are chicken shits who would not publish such papers so as to avoid any embarrassment on their part.  This proposal would only lead to more mediocrity than we already see in published journal articles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One last story. I found a brief article on review etiquette and courtesy written by a famous psychologist a lot of years ago, read it, and found it very inspiring and helpful.  I mentioned it to my advisor, describing to him how good an essay it was.  He told me that 15 years prior to that he had received a review from that same individual that was the rudest one he&#039;d ever received.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few years back, a retiring editor of a journal wrote in his goodbye letter that the most enjoyable thing to him while he was editor, and what he would miss the most, were the comments that the reviewers gave to him, the ones not to be shared with the authors.  
I once worked on a paper as a coauthor down on the list that took six rounds of revisions and objections by mainly one reviewer.  The lead author on the paper, who had written a lot in the area, knew who the dissenting reviewer was, just by how s/he wrote.  I often wondered what the editor thought about letting it go on that long.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

When Aaron and I presented our clinical poster -- &quot;The Role of Nutrition in the Epigenetics of Health: a Patient-Driven Approach -- at UCLA a few weeks back and listed our two individual e-patient self-experimentation cases as content, one academic looked over our poster and then told me, &quot;This is not science. There&#039;s no real science here. This is just two cases.&quot;

Clinical medicine is founded on the patient narrative, the study of individual patient cases. Somehow this spirit has not translated into the empirical side of medical inquiry. Clinicians engaged with patients in self-experimentation, I suspect, is one practical way to fill that gap.

Best,

Brent]]></description>
