		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m surprised it hasn&#039;t been obvious to most people that movement is good for thinking and learning.  Perhaps what we really need is to overcome bias in perceptions about ourselves in order to better recognize these performance factors.  I believe trying to improve performance at sports through training and diet helps us become more accurate evaluators of performance factors.  It has made a difference for me but I think you have to push yourself to the limit.  If you&#039;re winning every race without trying, you probably won&#039;t be striving for accurate evaluations.

Your blog topic reminds me of one of Richard Feynman&#039;s anecdotes about walking in order to think about physics, but doing it in the middle of the night.  He was stopped by police that wanted to know why he was out walking at an unusual hour.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Here&#8217;s the backstory. We came across a tiny little blurb on Slatest the other day that referenced a blog by Seth Roberts, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Tsinghua University in Beijing and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley. He discovered that when you add boring and boring, you end up with pleasant. In Roberts&#8217; case, task No. 1 was studying Chinese via a flashcard system called Anki. Stone bore. Task No. 2 was riding the treadmill. Another big yawn. But when he combined the two, he found that both became pleasurable. He walked, he learned, he enjoyed. All about the distraction? Diversion? Multi-tasking with a purpose? Nope, writes Roberts. More like evolution:  The Anki/treadmill symmetry is odd because lots of people think we need exercise to be healthy but Iâ€™ve never heard someone say we need to study to be healthy. The evolutionary reason for this might be to push people to walk in new places (which provide something to learn) rather than old places (which donâ€™t). To push them to explore.

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Not only is it good to get up and move around, but if you&#8217;re doing something boring, it might be far more enjoyable to do it while you&#8217;re huffing away on the treadmill. And especially if you&#8217;re trying to memorize stuff, it might go quicker if you&#8217;re walking while learning. Maybe the practical lesson is that we enjoy learning dry stuff when walking but not when stationary. Pity the 99.9% of students who study stationary. Ideally youâ€™d listen to a lecture while walking somewhere, perhaps around a track. [...]]]></description>

Nice discovery. You might check out this site:

http://www.treadmill-desk.com/

I have one myself. Currently attached to the handles, but this causes too much vibration. I&#039;m going to make a free standing desk. They&#039;re also available from Steelcase, but fairly expensive, ~$5K.

This fits in with flow-type theory.  Ideal functioning requires using lots of one&#039;s available resources.  If one is not using all the resources, you have a concern.  

I also note that the examples you gave are both cases of mixing moderate physical activity with moderate mental activity.  This may be relevant to your findings.]]></description>
