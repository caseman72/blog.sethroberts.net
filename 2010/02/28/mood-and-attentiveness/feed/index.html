		<description><![CDATA[One general finding of emotion researchers is that inducing positive mood, by having the experimenter tap the subject on the shoulder and smile, or offer cookies, or various other manipulations, results in a greater range of more creative associations to words, so at least the imagination is opened up. 

I don&#039;t know how the &quot;trinket&quot; finding fits into the overall research. I&#039;m a writer who is very depressive -- the one word people use repeatedly to describe my published writing is &quot;thoughtful,&quot; for whatever that is worth... Depression can make you question the point of doing anything; it can paralyze motivation, which in turn may free your attention...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This line of research led Andrews to conduct his own experiment, as he sought to better understand the link between negative mood and improved analytical abilities. He gave 115 undergraduates an abstract-reasoning test known as Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices, which requires subjects to identify a missing segment in a larger pattern. (Performance on the task strongly predicts general intelligence.) The first thing Andrews found was that nondepressed students showed an increase in â€œdepressed affectâ€ after taking the test. In other words, the mere presence of a challenging problem â€” even an abstract puzzle â€” induced a kind of attentive trance, which led to feelings of sadness. It doesnâ€™t matter if weâ€™re working on a mathematical equation or working through a broken heart: the anatomy of focus is inseparable from the anatomy of melancholy. This suggests that depressive disorder is an extreme form of an ordinary thought process, part of the dismal machinery that draws us toward our problems, like a magnet to metal.&quot;

Obvious implications for the benefit of meditation, here. Putting aside a little bit of time to very pointedly not solve any problems.

If concentrating on a problem is depressing, the drive to concentrate on solving problems might be implicated in depression. Or the depression itself might only be coincidental, happiness might compete with problem-solving for resources. Happy people might be better at problem solving because they have more of these competed-for resources.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Depressed people certainly are better at some things than non depressed (never depressed) people-such as processing negatively weighted words http://tinyurl.com/yj8kc5s The trouble is the things they tend to be better at may not help them. Better recall for negative events but worse recall for postive ones and less accurate and exegeratted recall for their own physical ailments http://tinyurl.com/yzzchgb
 

Interesting post thanks, Mark]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The question that came to my mind was this- Did the happier, more upbeat people focus more on the other people (cashier) than the items around the checkout, and did the melancholy shoppers focus more on the items and less on the cashier?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sometime ago I practiced Tibetan Buddhism and read Chogyam Trungpaâ€”an interesting monk by any measure. I could be off since I&#039;m working with memory, but I recall in one of his books I read he was stressing not only attentivenessâ€”no surprise thereâ€”but also how important it was to feel melancholy as a way of life. As if melancholy were the only emotion underlying a present and attentive life.]]></description>
