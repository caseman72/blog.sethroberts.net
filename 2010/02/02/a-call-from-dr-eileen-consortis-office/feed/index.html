		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, the parathyroid adenoma was causing me to have high levels of calcium in the blood (this is how I was first diagnosed), so it needed to be removed regardless.  All the references I found recommended removal of the adenoma.

The neck has many delicate structures, particularly nerves.  A fairly common complication of neck surgery is damage to the laryngeal nerve, which can cause hoarseness (sometimes permanent).  Doing neck surgery twice, when once is enough, doesn&#039;t make any sense.  My first surgeon seemed to specialize in breast cancer, where taking a biopsy sample is more routine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you ask a surgeon if you should have surgery most of of the time the answer is going to be &quot;yes&quot; because that is the solution they are trained to provide.  Surgeons cut and sew and, if they spend time thinking about their profession, it is more likely to be about how to cut and sew better, not how not to cut and sew. So, in a case where you have doubts that surgery is necessary, it may be better to consult with a non-surgeon.  

This doctor apparently accepted the conventional thinking of her profession (i.e. cut out everything that could grow to be a problem) as fact, even though research may not exist to back up that thinking in this case. In reality, much of medicine is practiced is practiced this way. (As an example, check out this recent article: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/health/26child.html?ref=health) If medicine purely relied on scientific fact and not on cultural norms, one would expect to see less variance in the way things are done from city-city in the U.S. and between countries. 

Too bad the system isn&#039;t more objective  and transparent when it comes to treatment outcomes and we are left to scour the internet to find some clues.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My son had repeated strep throat infections over the course of a year.  We were referred to an ENT doctor who suggested tonsillectomy.  I researched tonsillectomy for strep with no tonsillitis and found that on average in the year following a tonsillectomy patients like my son get one fewer strep infection.  Surgery with it&#039;s risks, and ten day recovery, seems like a steep price to pay for one fewer infection.  I brought my son to a naturopath who made some supplement and herb suggestions that we followed and my son has not had strep since.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned from dealing with the healthcare industry, it&#039;s this: you have to do your own research and take charge of your own situation.

About ten years ago, I was diagnosed with a parathyroid adenoma (a non-cancerous growth of glandular origin).  My endocrinologist referred me to a surgeon whose office was in the same building.  The two doctors were buddies, as I found out later.

When I went to my initial appointment with the surgeon, the first thing I noticed was that his waiting room was filled with posters, flyers, pamphlets, etc. all about breast cancer.  I saw no information about any other type of cancer.  This fact immediately made me suspicious.

When I met the surgeon, he told me that his plan was to do an operation to take a biopsy sample, and then go back at a later date to excise the growth.  This strategy made absolutely no sense to me.  Surgery in the neck is complicated and risky, and there didn&#039;t seem to be any reason to do it twice, when you could remove the growth the first time.

I went to my local medical school and looked up a bunch of articles and textbooks.  I couldn&#039;t find anything that corroborated the surgeon&#039;s recommendation.

I asked my endocrinologist to refer me to a surgeon who specializes in endocrine surgery.  The second surgeon basically confirmed my suspicion that the first surgeon was nuts.

I had my surgery with no significant complications.
