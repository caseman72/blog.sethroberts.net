		<description><![CDATA[Seth, the economics professor said that he agrees that Freakonomics is low- status research.  He said, &quot;But I would use the word &#039;popular [instead of low-status]&#039; &quot;  and  &quot;it&#039;s not real economics research.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Turning again to the economics profession, a good example of high/low status problem is the gap between economists who work on policy (say in think tanks or government) and academics.  Relatively simple analysis of data is essential input for policymakers and top decision-makers.  And government is an important part of our economy.  So, in this sense, policy economists do very useful work.  (I&#039;m not saying they are all good -- just that they have an important role.)  The majority of the person-hours expended by academic economists has nothing to do with improving policy analysis.

We also seem to have a system in the US (and other countries) where some of the very top economist positions in government are filled by those who first made their name as academics.  In other words, they had to spend a long time demonstrating their high status to other academics (in not very useful ways) before getting the chance to employ relatively &quot;simple&quot; analysis in the public service.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth is 100% right about the paradox of Levitt.  Levitt himself is high-status and that high-status allowed him to low-status type data exploration e.g. baby names, the economics of drug dealers etc etc

(I should mention before Levitt, Steven Landsberg and David Friedman were also writing economics books in a similar vein.  However, I don&#039;t believe they did extensive research into some of these low-status subjects, generally only doing theoritical exploration of these e.g. why does popcorn cost so much in movie theaters?  etc etc

I know more than a few macro-economists who sniffed (jealously) at Levitt&#039;s massive mainstream success, commenting on how &quot;un-serious&quot; and &quot;unimportant&quot; his work was.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;m glad you mentioned psychiatry.  I may have posted this link in the past, but here is an excellent book about the psychiatric establishment and how it does more to harm patients than help them:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Mad-America-Medicine-Enduring-Mistreatment/dp/0738203858&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mad in America: : Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Robert Whitaker.

Whitaker (the author) is also coming out with a new book soon:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Epidemic-Bullets-Psychiatric-Astonishing/dp/0307452417/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

It should be out in April.  I&#039;ve pre-ordered it.  If it&#039;s anything like the previous book, it should be excellent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LemmusLemmus, I&#039;m not saying all economists think alike. Lots of people were glad Nixon went to China. Enough prominent statisticians liked Tukey&#039;s emphasis on graphics that the whole area has become more popular. Nor am I saying that Levitt&#039;s work was simply low-status. It was also well-done -- just as Tukey&#039;s work wasn&#039;t merely low-status. He also introduced important new ways of making graphs. Disdain for what Levitt has studied has been publically expressed by Heckman, one of his colleagues. But I agree with you to this extent: Levitt had technical skills that made his work on low-status questions more acceptable to his profession.  People are far more concerned about their own status than other people&#039;s. Professor X, who would never study something low-status, might be quite happy that Levitt did so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I&#039;m not buying the revised version of the Levitt&#039;s-work-as-low-status view either. According to his CV, he got the John Bates Clark Medal in 2003. The papers that went into Freakonomics are (based on Wikipedia&#039;s chapter overview, plus memory - i.e., I may have overlooked stuff):

Cheating teachers - 2002 , QJE, Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs
Cheating sumo wrestlers - 2002, AER
Drug-selling gang&#039;s finances - 2000, QJE
Abortion and crime - 2001, QJE
SES and names - 2004, QJE

The established economists that vote for the Bates Clark Medal clearly liked the &quot;low-status&quot; stuff that went into Freakonomics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Socktopi &amp; M, you make a good point that perhaps I should have made. (In an earlier draft, I did.) It&#039;s like Nixon and China. That his anti-communist credentials were secure made it easier for him to go to China. Long before Exploratory Data Analysis, John Tukey&#039;s very high status was assured. He was a co-inventor of the Fast Fourier Transform, for example. I&#039;m sure he was utterly unconcerned how EDA would affect his perceived status. (As L says, it didn&#039;t help. It really did get a scornful reception from some high-status statistics professors.) Likewise with Levitt. Just as you say, Socktopi, Levitt&#039;s very high status made it easier for him to do low-status research.

I wouldn&#039;t call the stuff Levitt studied &quot;esoteric&quot;. For the field of economics, they are esoteric topics but for the general public they are common concerns: &lt;em&gt;What to name our baby?&lt;/em&gt; for example. You could say that by doing such research, Levitt signaled his extremely high status -- just as Tukey did, just as Nixon signalled his extreme anti-communism by going to China. In practice I don&#039;t think it works that way. I don&#039;t think the motive for the work is signaling. I don&#039;t think Nixon went to China to show how incredibly anti-communist he was. Nor did Tukey write EDA to show how incredibly high status he was.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this post is great and agree in general.  But I&#039;ll chime in and agree that Steven Levitt is about as &quot;high status&quot; as you can get within the academic economics community.  The Clark Medal is only given out once every two years (as opposed to one Nobel a year).  I think one of the reasons that he is high status is because he has used fairly conventional econometric techniques to &quot;colonize&quot; areas not traditionally the realm of economists.  (Eg, what would have been considered the realm of sociology.)]]></description>
