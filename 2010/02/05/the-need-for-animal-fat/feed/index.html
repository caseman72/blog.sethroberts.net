		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps I misunderstood the post &quot;On the 3rd day nausea and diarrhea developed. When fat meat was added to the diet, a full recovery was made in 2 days&quot;

It sounds like this was just 3 days into a new diet that he got a common upset which then cleared up 5 days into the diet. Quite normal even without a new diet.

Is this another case of far too little original data being published?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two factors changed coincident to the digestive problem clearing up:

1) meat fat was introduced to the diet
2) more time had passed

How can we find out which factor cured the digestive problem?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Big fan of fat over here. I&#039;ve tried low carb eating, but I kept gaining weight. Could not figure it out. Suddenly realized I was focusing on protein, and lean protein at that. Once I switched my focus to fats, I lost the weight I had gained, and I can&#039;t tell you how much better I feel after adding more animal fats into my diet. My dry skin totally disappeared. Bring on the butter, cream, and whole eggs!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I take away from that is that if you eat meat, you should also eat a certain amount of fat with it. I don&#039;t know about a vegan diet, but switching to vegetarian has helped my digestion. 

When your SLD stuff first appeared on the freakonomics blog (was it ~4 years ago already?) I did the SLD based on your original paper and was suddenly eating a lot fewer calories each day. I decided if I was eating fewer calories, I should make sure I get the most value from those that I did eat, so I started eating a lot more veggies and quickly stumbled into being a vegetarian. When stopped eating meat, my digestion improved greatly. Around the same time I added yogurt (which I suddenly craved), and then (after you blogged about it) Kombucha. They have improved things even more (in particular, reducing sensitivity to dairy I used to have). 

The only animal fat I get is from eggs (which I do eat frequently) and diary (which I only get from yogurt and some cheese).
