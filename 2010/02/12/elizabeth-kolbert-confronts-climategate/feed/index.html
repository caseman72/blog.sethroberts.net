		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Will. I suppose he was saying that he wasn&#039;t in the least shocked by the Climategate emails. If he didn&#039;t learn something from the emails, he&#039;s not too bright. If he thinks others didn&#039;t learn from them, he&#039;s wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, yes, you and I differ greatly on how much we (the scientific community) actually know about this. Phil thinks the science is settled, so do you, but I think the science (e.g., Hansen) is far less certain than claimed. I also believe its overstatedness will eventually become clear. (This post is about one small example of that.) Phil says, &quot;how could 90% of the experts be wrong?&quot; I say: Lots of people move into the &quot;wrong&quot; column when there is money, attention, and status to be made by such a move. Especially when the fact that you&#039;re wrong is hard for the general public to realize. (E.g., dermatologists claiming that acne isn&#039;t caused by diet. An example where &gt;90% of the experts are wrong.) I wish there was a prediction market where I could put money on my belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, that&#039;s a great post you link to, but doesn&#039;t suggest anything is settled. The comments provide a number of interesting critiques of the post which aren&#039;t convincingly refuted. I&#039;m an agnostic on the extent and signicance of anthropogenic influence on the climate.

Most interesting to me is how difficult it seems for people to remove their emotions from the debate. Informed, intelligent people take positions on either side and seem frustrated by, angry at, irritated with or hostile toward people who don&#039;t share their opinions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, that&#039;s an interesting point. Kolbert is not a science write in the usual sense. The only science she writes about is climate science. Before writing about climate science, she wrote about politics. I suppose she got permission to write about global warming by telling her bosses that the science was settled, the news in the coming years will be about the translation of science into action, which is basically politics. Now that the science turns out not to be settled, she is in a difficult position.]]></description>
