		<description><![CDATA[Vic, I don&#039;t think that propping up the Big Three for a few years or even ten years going to save American manufacturing. All manufacturing is much larger than those three companies. The book In Praise of Hard Industries lamented the loss of American manufacturing expertise long before GM went bankrupt. As for small businesses, all sorts of businesses that are now big (such as Google) were both small and hard to imagine 10 years ago. There&#039;s a reason that people move to Silicon Valley to start businesses rather than to India or Nigeria: the prospects for those new businesses are better here. If you mean that large businesses are the sign of a rich country, you&#039;re obviously right -- but I&#039;m sure that those large businesses were once small. The rich country is rich because it provided an environment that allowed small companies to flourish.]]></description>
