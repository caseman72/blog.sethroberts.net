		<description><![CDATA[I rejected: 1. a two finger classification task. 2. a balance task. 3. a short-term memory task (digit span). 4. a paper-and-pencil classification task. 5. an arithmetic task where the problems are blocked rather than separated.  6. a one-finger typing task with preview (the string to be typed is shown before the signal to start typing). 7. a one-finger typing task without preview. 8. A time-discrimination task (the interval between clicks). 9. A task requiring me to move the pointer a precise distance using the touchpad. 10. A task where I move the pointer from place to place on the screen as quickly as possible.

Task 9 was the most fun and I&#039;m sorry I couldn&#039;t use it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What were some of the other tasks you rejected?

I had a friend who played a great deal of blitz chess on ICC. They give you a quantified rating. He had a lot of variation between 2100 and 1600. Thinking back, I wonder if that wasn&#039;t a good measure of his brain function. He had a lot of late nights. On a particularly late (early?) morning even I beat him once.

I think the only factor I would control for is how much chess I played recently. I noticed that my rating would go up if I played a lot and go down quickly if I quit. Maybe that&#039;s just too big of an effect.

Anyway... what did you reject?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Justin &amp; Mike, thanks for your interest. Okay, I will post the R code.

Ming-Chi, I would think that peak performance is less variable than average performance. In peak performance, everything is pushed up against a ceiling, not so in average performance. I also don&#039;t understand how average performance could be measured.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed your talk at the QS meetup Professor Roberts. 

Reaction time with simple mental tasks measure peak performance. Whereas arguably one may find average performance more directly relevant for day-to-day work. And statistically it may enjoy smaller measurement variations for making inferences. 

It was the first QS event I have been to. Hope to hear more of your findings in the future. Thanks!]]></description>
