		<description><![CDATA[I have had severe digestive problems with food ever since I had a breakdown 3 years ago. I was also suffering from TMJ which had not been diagnosed &amp; was taking aspirin every 2 hours from months for the pain. Before this I had celiac disease, was lactose intollerant, and also stayed away from corn, but I was doing quite well. After this, many of the things I could eat before, including a little tomato began to really upset my stomach. I started the Intro diet with 1 tsp of saurkraut juice (and have been taking a probiotic before I started) for 3 days &amp; now my stomach feels on fire. I haven&#039;t done any of the rest of the diet (the bone broth). Also I have quite a rash. SHould I cut the saurkraut juice to 1/4 tsp. or stop for a bit?]]></description>
