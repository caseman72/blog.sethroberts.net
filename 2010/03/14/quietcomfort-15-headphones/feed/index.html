		<description><![CDATA[I used to buy foam ear plugs by the industrial case for my wife when she was in nursing school and then working on her CRNA -- she would use them and give them to friends.  They work very well.  You can clean them by tossing them in the laundry, just put them in a button down pocket on a pair of pants or a shirt.

They really worked well.  Flents is a brand of foam ear plugs.

Of course you can&#039;t listen to music or podcasts with the earplugs the way you can with noise cancellation ear phones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Timothy Beneke,

you might want to try Flents &quot;Quiet! Please&quot; Ear Plugs. The NRR 29 gives you 7 extra decibels of noise reduction over Mac&#039;s.  25 pair cost ~ $8.00. Downsides: a little time-consuming and solipsistic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I prefer the in-ear headphones that suppress external noise due to their flanged plugs (like earplugs). They are very small and require no power source.  They are great for yardwork when using the lawnmower or leaf blower which is also a great opportunity to listen to a good book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did the same experiment on BART after noticing how much less exhausted I felt after flying with QC2s.

I&#039;ve ended up using Apple&#039;s in ear ($80) earbuds which block out a lot of sound as a regular compromise.  They aren&#039;t as good as the QCs, but they are a lot easier to wear in public.

I find that the noise of busy streets is similarly exhausting, and these have made a huge difference to my general sense of well-being.]]></description>
