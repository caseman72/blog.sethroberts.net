		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re wrong, but . . . you&#039;re awfully sure of yourself here.  Remember how the other day on my blog you criticized an author for &quot;taking 10 minutes to call&quot; a person mentioned in her book . . . and it turned out that she _had_ tried to call him?  No big deal, just a point to illustrate that sometimes you go a bit over the top.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And speaking of books that make no sense, I once had a girlfriend whose favorite book was &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Memories-Dreams-Reflections-C-G-Jung/dp/0679723951&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Memories, Dreams, Reflections/i&gt;, by Carl Jung.  I tried reading it, but I never made it past the half-way point.  It seemed like the most unbelievable collection of pretentious, pseudo-profound codswallop.  But a small part of me had some doubt -- perhaps I was just too stupid to understand the depths of Jung&#039;s thinking.  Thus, many years later, it was gratifying for me to read the following book &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3345/is_3_22/ai_n29044108/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of a biography of Jung:

==========================

Jung was a preternaturally unclear writer and thinker:  he would never say anything clearly when obfuscation would do.  Whether this was from lack of talent or an unconscious appreciation that clarity led to the possibility of contradiction and even refutation, no one can say...

What was Jung&#039;s lasting legacy?  He founded a small and on the whole harmless esoteric psychotherapeutic cult.  His doctrines will never attract large numbers of people because his writings and teachings are diffuse, contradictory, and overloaded with erudition that partakes more of pedantry than of scholarship.  [...]

To read Jung is to enter a world more of connotation than of denotation, of meanings hinted at rather than expressed forthrightly.  To extract a definite opinion from Jung is like trying to catch an eel with soapy hands, or trap steam with a butterfly net.  His esoteric erudition is formidable:  it is difficult to refute a man who will not say what he means, but backs whatever he means up with a plethora of references to fourteenth-century texts.  Actually, Jung was grossly superstitious, had no idea what a logical argument was, and was capable of believing the purest nonsense.
