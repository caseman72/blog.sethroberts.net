		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit late to the party (your entry was dated March, 2010) but as a sexy old woman (77), my mantra is butter is a reason to wake up in the morning. I&#039;ve gone through every type of butter available, hoping that the organic grass-fed type (truly deep yellow in color) would be the best but Jana Valley (Czech butter) is number one for me. 

People are always asking how, at my advanced age, I am wrinkle free and when I say that I eat lots of good saturated fat, they shudder.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dean, why do you think that hand activity might matter? In the case of the anomalous results, I ate the butter a few hours before the test. And the effect -- the improvement caused by the butter -- seemed to grow during those hours, which is what you&#039;d expect as a nutrient is gradually absorbed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hand activity prior to solving equations could count as another parameter. Since buttering the bread could be counted as hand activity, it might be more accurate experimenting to butter the bread before the baseline is measured, or solve equations after buttering but before eating the butter.
Also how long after eating the butter do you solve the equations? Maybe there is an optimal time to wait to obtain the best results.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Pork fat is about 40% saturated fat. So I got more saturated fat from my pork fat than I got from my butter.&quot;

Actually pork fat reflects what the pig ate because of how it&#039;s digestive system works. If you feed pig corn and soy, it&#039;s fat is going to be a lot more unsaturated then the nutritional tables are telling you. On the other side cow has bacterias in rumen that will saturate the polyunsaturated oils she eats. Rest assured that you ate a lot more saturated fats with butter then with lard.

&quot;Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m catching on: butter is not a paleolithic food. Pork fat is much closer.&quot;

I would not fall for this paleo dogma. We are mammals. It&#039;s paleo only in the mythological thinking of the &quot;let&#039;s do every stupid thing hunter-gatherers did&quot; kind, but metabolicaly speaking it&#039;s a nonsense. Butter is easier to absorb because it&#039;s higher ratio of short and middle chain fatty acids mean that it needs less action from your digestive system, and for the same reason it&#039;s also better fuel. Same for coconut oil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great self-experimenting! I think it would be very useful to redo your experiment with the four manipulations delivered in various orders to really isolate the individual factors by balancing out order effects. If you replicate the butter effect (which is not surprising to any one who knows of the work of Weston A. Price), then it would be interesting to do direct comparisons among various dietary lipids, such as coconut oil (~90% medium chain saturated fats), lard, tallow, butter, olive oil, and fish liver oil. I&#039;d love to see a comparative analysis of the effects of fatty acids on cognition.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, thanks for the link. As for pork fat vs. butter, I divided my pork belly into meat and fat -- physically divided it -- and made sure I got plenty of fat. For example, 100 g in one meal. Pork fat is about 40% saturated fat. So I got more saturated fat from my pork fat than I got from my butter. I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m catching on: butter is not a paleolithic food. Pork fat is much closer. Standing and walking and walking on rocks are very paleo. Butter was the least paleo thing I did, yet it appeared to be the most effective.

Alex, trials with errors are dropped from the numbers used to compute average reaction times. I do an analysis that adjusts for overall error rate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re catching on, Seth...despite all the demonizing it gets from the mainstream media, animal fat is the stuff of life. I suggest looking up the Paleo movement (this guy, a well-written, levelheaded MD, is a good place to start: http://www.paleonu.com/what-is-panu/); most of us eat diets primarily composed of animal fat, and credit it with improved fitness, sleep, mental functioning, and general health. 

As for the difference between pork and butter, the difference isn&#039;t whether the fat is trapped in cell walls, but whether it&#039;s saturated or unsaturated. Butter is 51% saturated fat by weight; pork belly is only 19% (calculated from nutritiondata.com). Repeat your comparison with other foods high in saturated fat (such as coconut), and I suspect you&#039;ll find the same results.]]></description>
