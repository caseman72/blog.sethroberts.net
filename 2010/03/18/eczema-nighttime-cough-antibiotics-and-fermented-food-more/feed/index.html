		<description><![CDATA[I have been stunned at how my sinuses have improved over the last four months after ingesting larger quantities of probiotics.  After reading Huffnagle&#039;s book The Probiotics Revolution and your writing on the umami hypothesis (which led to an attempt to make the most umami-infused high-fat burger ever), I&#039;m now eating 1-2 c yogurt day, taking Culturelle Lactobacillus (1/day) and several other bacteria-laden products.  While I still have allergies, I have only had stuffed sinuses twice (for one day each time) for the last four months!  I had been known at work as the guy who sneezed coming in and had suffered from extreme sinus closure (neti pots didn&#039;t help, decongestant rebound was a problem).  I still sneeze from allergies at times but they seem to have gone down as well.  Also, 4 caps of flaxseed oil per day--still helping my gums.  Fish oil seems to work better for my mood and thought process, though.  Am now trying the Shangri-La diet (appetite suppression strategy)....you&#039;re a star, Seth!]]></description>
