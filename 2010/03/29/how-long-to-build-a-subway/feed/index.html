		<description><![CDATA[I wonder how Tokyo compares. It seems there is a new subway line or extension every year that I had never even known was under construction. You can go anywhere within the Yamanote Line circle of central Tokyo and easily walk to one station or another in a few minutes.

They have some lines now that are really, really deep, many escalators segments down, because they have to tunnel under other subway lines. There was a book by an ex Japanese TV journalist about &quot;underground Tokyo&quot; that I started to read (before I figured out it was an insane conspiracy theory book about secret underground bases and institutions) that had some interesting subway construction data, including that the cost doubles with every X meters of depth. Among other things, the amount of water seepage gets worse and worse the deeper you go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I assume the increasing progress in Beijing (at least in the underground part of the system) is due in large part to a big change in digging technology. I don&#039;t know if this link will come through, but here&#039;s a fascinating article on the Swiss company that developed the new machines: http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/09/15/080915fa_fact_bilger]]></description>
