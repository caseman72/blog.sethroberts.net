		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I also use an SMF forum for my &quot;Getting Stronger&quot; blog, but it is hosted by SiteGround.  By coincidence, I also had my forum hacked on Thursday, and it crashed!  It was being overrun by spambots (computer generated spam) from Russia and China, posting Viagra ads and the like.  I thought I was getting good traffic this weeks, but it was the spambots.  I contacted SiteGround and they fixed the problem immediately.  I found their service is terrific.  You don&#039;t get to talk to humans (except their sales department), but they have you post tickets on their site, and I got immediate response, within 15 minutes.  They rebuilt my site completely from backups.  I&#039;m very satisfied. (Incidentally, I&#039;ve altered my registration procedure to require reading of more difficult letter patterns, and confirmation by e-mail.  So far, no more spambots.]]></description>
