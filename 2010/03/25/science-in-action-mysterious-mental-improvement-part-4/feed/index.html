		<description><![CDATA[RJB Boston, I think butter helps because our brains need certain fats to work their best. And my diet wasn&#039;t supplying enough of them. Butter has the missing fat or fats. I believe this effect isn&#039;t restricted to me, for four reasons. 1. the brain is more than half fat. 2. As far as I know, everyone thinks fat tastes good -- and this reflects an underlying need, I&#039;m sure, just the way we like salt reflects an underlying need. 3. Long ago, people ate lots of animal fat. 4. There are cultural traditions that animal fat is &quot;brain food&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

It is interesting to me that you so quickly dismiss the effects of practice and time.  My experience as a juggler (as well as the admittedly anecdotal experience of my juggling friends) does not bear out what seem to be the underlying assumptions[1].  In particular there is the phenomenon of the &quot;click&quot;, a sudden increase in the ability to perform a certain trick or maintain a pattern, usually accompanied by a sense of increased understanding or an improved ability to feel what is going on or even a sense of time slowing down.  These clicks sometimes happen after long, regular periods of practice and sometimes even when returning to a skill after taking a break of a month or two.  Often progress is marked by several clicks, and while steady progress does occur sometimes (typically when improvement is a matter of increased endurance or speed), this seems to be the exception rather than the rule.  Following a click, there is rarely complete regression to a previous level of competency, even after a prolonged lapse, a little rustiness notwithstanding.

Now I&#039;ll admit, I was not paying close attention to my diet or habits when I experienced my most recent clicks (nor indeed the less recent ones), so it is possible that they were more likely to happen when I consumed a greater than usual amount of butter or fish oil.  And that would indeed be interesting.  I would suggest, though, that one has to be extremely careful when drawing conclusions from such a limited set of data, especially when we have so little knowledge about how the brain&#039;s abilities change over time absent the effects of dietary changes.

--

[1] To wit, that skill in a given area improves with practice in a more or less continuous way and tends to asymptotically approach a ceiling.  Please correct me if I&#039;m misinterpreting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, my family is a strong believer in the benefits of butter.  Glad to see your experiments confirm that.

@TommySchmitz got me thinking about the effects of different kinds of butter.  Seth, have you worked on anything like that?  I was specifically thinking about organic butter and butter from cows who have no antibiotics and are grass fed ... things like that.

I just found your writings today but am going to look more closely into your thoughts.  Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 

Interesting observation about butter, and it got me perusing some of your other posts.  At one point a pop-up question (an ad, perhaps) appeared asking if I were aware of Lank o Lakes spreadable butter with canola oil.  Well, a few days ago we had our own weird (and off-topic) observation about butter. My girlfriend was cooking with both margarine and butter.  Two spoonfuls of each were on the kitchen counter, inches apart, when a line of ants approached the spoons.  Hundreds.  They all went for the margarine.  Not a single one approached the butter.  Not to monkey with the Land o Lakes marketing strategy, but math-test mileage may vary for the ants.  - Tommy.]]></description>
