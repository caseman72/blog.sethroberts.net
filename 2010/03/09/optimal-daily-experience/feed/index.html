		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth,

I like your post it really speaks some truth in the matter of physical needs. The body needs to be constantly releasing certain chemicals like endorphins and adrenaline which are commonly produced by exercise. It also needs to get into the habit of breaking down fat cells and fatty acids, and of course burning calories. I agree with the other stuff but mainly support the point of physical activity as I&#039;m a professional fitness blogger myself. Cool blog by the way! Feel free to drop by mine anytime. 

Take care]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] A paper by Seth Roberts on how/why self experiments are so effective (PDF) via Quantified Self.  Over 12 years, my self-experimentation found new and useful ways to improve sleep, mood, health, and weight. Why did it work so well? First, my position was unusual. I had the subject-matter knowledge of an insider, the freedom of an outsider, and the motivation of a person with the problem. I didn&#8217;t need to publish regularly. I didn&#8217;t want to display status via my research. Second, I used a powerful tool. Self-experimentation about the brain can test ideas much more easily (by a factor of about 500,000) than conventional research about other parts of the body. When you gather data, you sample from a power-law-like distribution of progress. Most data helps a little; a tiny fraction of data helps a lot. My subject-matter knowledge and methodological skills (e.g., in data analysis) improved the distribution from which I sampled (i.e., increased the average amount of progress per sample). Self-experimentation allowed me to sample from it much more often than conventional research. Another reason my self-experimentation was unusually effective is that, unlike professional science, it resembled the exploration of our ancestors, including foragers, hobbyists, and artisans.

My categories mostly seem to overlap with yours -- and with each other: learning something can count as both Intellectual and New!
However, I&#039;ve found it useful to include Artistic (which is really &#039;Creative&#039;, but the acronym got confusing: encompasses writing, craft activities, baking) and Cultural, which might be anything from reading a novel to listening to (new) music to watching a movie.

		<description><![CDATA[Alexandra, long ago (the 1970s?) someone found that commuters tend to travel about an hour per day -- regardless of the length of their trip! so people who had short distance trips made them longer duration than necessary.

		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating as always, Seth!! Having come to rely perhaps too much on tracking devices to homogenize my life, I&#039;m cautiously warming up to a life of extremes... 

I&#039;m especially curious about the daily travel though - what&#039;s the reasoning behind that?

For my own list I would add a good laugh and a long hug each day (tied in to social connection), and a monthly meta-layer of re-evaluating my life goals and my optimal daily experience list. :)]]></description>
