		<description><![CDATA[ben, the reason for using very simple arithmetic problems is so that little learning will be involved -- I already know really well that 3 + 1 = 4. Use of larger numbers will allow more learning. I don&#039;t know really well that 17+39 = 56.

		<description><![CDATA[it seems like you are measuring response time more than anything, with times in the sub-second range. perhaps you should do less trials of larger digit additions, so that you&#039;d have to do multiple operations and juggle numbers. I think long pauses for &quot;duh&quot; moments ought to be included in the data.

could you post your R code?]]></description>

Yes, very soothing. I started taking flaxseed oil a month ago, and noticed the calming effect pretty much immediately. I&#039;m not a particularly anxious person, so I&#039;m curious to see if people with anxiety problems respond the same way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve used Spectrum Organic and Barlean&#039;s flaxseed oil. I never found a difference.

The math test I do is simpler than the math test on that page. I only use addition, subtraction, and multiplication -- no division. And the two numbers being combined are always single digits (0-9). My test doesn&#039;t have the awkward interface of the web test--you keep your hands on the number keys and type a single digit. And each trial is separated from previous trials by a few seconds at least. I go at my own pace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What strikes me about the flaxseed oil is how emotionally and physically soothed I feel for about half an hour after I take it. It has a calming effect; I&#039;m tempted to say that it induces a state of serenity, or near-serenity. It certainly assuages hunger far more than an equivalent number of carbohydrate of protein calories does. 

I&#039;d be very curious to see ANS physiology measures or other measures of things associated with calmness and soothing -- oxytocin or vagus nerve activation. 

Also, does anyone else find flaxseed oil soothing?]]></description>
