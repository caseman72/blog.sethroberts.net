		<description><![CDATA[I once had to learn enough Chinese to get by thanks to a quick unexpected trip (for a funeral of all things) to China. I heard from a military intelligence friend of mine that in his unit, he learned that when you need to learn a new language, if you engage in cross-dominant physical activities (crossing your legs and arms, doing things with both hands at the same time, etc, there is actually an exercise program called Brain Gym that they used), then you will learn at a significantly faster rate.

It worked for me, it worked so well, that I now use those Brain Gym exercises when I need to learn anything at all!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds familiar to James Heisig&#039;s approach, where he also separates the meaning from the reading (pronunciation) of Chinese characters, and focuses on creating mnemonic clues based on the radicals. Scroll down to the bottom of this Wikipedia entry for links to free sample PDFs.

		<description><![CDATA[I would echo the advice to learn pronunciation as well as meaning, for two reasons. First, because as you learn more characters they become more regular, with useful keys to both pronunciation and meaning. The more cues you have to a character the less like you are to have retrieval failures. Second, since you spend time in Beijing, it makes to learn as much spoken Chinese as possible, and to do that it is important to integrate spoken and written language (particularly because Chinese has so many homophones at the level of characters, given that there are an order of magnitude fewer syllables than English has). 

A really fascinating book, now out of print, that touches on these issues is David Kelley&#039;s &quot;Deciphering the Maya script.&quot; It describes two attempts to decipher non-alphabetic scripts (Mayan and hieroglyphics) that only succeeded when they were able to connect them to the closest remaining spoken languages. I believe he also says that students at Harvard in the mid 1900s would try to learn classical Chinese using a meaning-based method (since we don&#039;t really know how classical Chinese was pronounced) without great success.

I think you&#039;re right that if you had to pick one thing to focus on, meaning over pronunciation would be the right thing to do with characters. We published a study a few years ago in JEP:LMC looking at how readers of English and Chinese responded to errors that are either visually similar to or phonologically similar to what should have been there (e.g., &quot;Paul Revere rode/robe/road his white horse&quot;). The basic finding was that Chinese readers used visual and phonological similarity as about equal cues, but English adult readers just used phonology beyond the very first fixation, so &quot;road his white horse&quot; is usually fine and &quot;robe his white horse&quot; never is. (Feng, G., Miller, K., Shu, H., &amp; Zhang, H. (2001). Rowed to recovery: The use of phonological and orthographic information in reading Chinese and English. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 27, 1079-1100.)

But the neat thing about the trek you&#039;re on is that you can try different strategies and go back and relearn what you missed. Really a perfect field for self-experimentation, which has certainly been my experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The best language-learning experience I ever had was a summer course at age 20 at the U of C (the good one, in Illinois, called French for Reading Knowledge.  We paid no attention at all to pronunciation, conversation - we just ground through the grammar as we read more and more.  I was left with the memory of many sentences that worked which I picked up from Gide and Giono, and can still read it easily.  When I met a Frenchman in the next few years, I would amuse him with my pronunication but amaze him with the complex ideas I could express - had I continued or lived in France for a few months, I would have been fluent.  Alas, I didn&#039;t.
On the other hand, in German classes from 3rd grade to Freshman in college, I learned it all - and now have very little (although I can sort of answer questions put to me in German in English).  My &quot;sense&quot; of French after 6 weeks of study remains better than my sense of German after 10 years of study - 35 years later.
Let your Chinese friends frown.  Pronunciation excellence avails you naught if you can&#039;t find the words, or can only bore your hearers.]]></description>
