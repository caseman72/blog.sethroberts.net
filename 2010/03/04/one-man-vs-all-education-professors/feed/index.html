		<description><![CDATA[Shane: I have also known teachers dedicated to their craft, and (unfortunately not redundantly) to seeing their charges learn.  My mother in law was one. But that says nothing about &lt;i&gt;educators&lt;/i&gt;, a nearly disjoint population.  The origins and aims of the education establishment were published openly and without shame in the 19th century, under names such as Mann and Carnegie, and it has remained true to its traditions.  There are great teachers, but they never, ever become educators.

At my university, the School of Education was where people washed out into when they failed everything else.  It was closed a few years after my graduation, for reasons that probably had nothing to do with that fact.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article about Lemov.  Sounds like he has a promising approach.   One thing that I didn&#039;t like about the NY Times article is that I had to get to the bottom of the entire gushing article to find out that they really don&#039;t have any real studies showing whether or not his results are replicable.  It would be nice if the next steps were someone funding studies to find out whether or not his work could be reproduced on a wide scale using average teachers and administrators (and are not simply the product of an extremely gifted individual being able to lift those around him to great heights).

		<description><![CDATA[I remember a few years ago, Seth&#039;s long self-experimentation paper was the most downloaded  out of all University of California published papers.  Not only  that, but there was a shorter paper he wrote that ranked high in downloads, at the same time.  I think the rank these papers occupied were #1 and #4.  Way to go!  I just found out recently!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Phil, thanks for explaining that.&#039;You&#039;re right that I misunderstood. I agree, some sort of filter is needed. I think a diversity of filters is a good idea. I&#039;d prefer a system in which, rather than every journal peer-reviewed, some journals were merely editor-reviewed (less democratic than peer review) and other journals published almost everything but had rankings based on reader response -- e.g., rankings by number of times downloaded (more democratic than peer review).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I was trying to point out --- by yanking your chain a little --- that peer review serves an important purpose of making it harder for people to publish work with obvious mistakes in it.  I&#039;ve had my own struggles with peer review --- twice in my career, I&#039;ve had journals reject a paper not because they found something wrong with it, but because one or two reviewers thought it didn&#039;t advance the field in an interesting way; my response has been to publish in other (less respected!  But still peer-reviewed) journals.  I don&#039;t want to sound like I&#039;m entirely satisfied with the normal peer review process.  But I don&#039;t have an alternative to propose, either.  I certainly would have no interest in reading a journal that published whatever anyone chose to submit, because most submissions would be garbage.  _Somebody_ has to serve as gatekeeper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There was an article in the Atlantic on this topic the other month, whose thesis was that Teach For America had been collecting crazy amounts of data to figure out what works, and coming up with actionable guidelines.  A bit confusing as the article you linked would seem to indicate otherwise.

I don&#039;t want to be flagged as spam, so I won&#039;t include a link, but you can find the Atlantic article by googling &quot;what makes a great teacher.&quot;

I&#039;d also like to add that I find the sort of comment made by Nathan Myers tiresome in the extreme.  I know a great many teachers, and while they vary in their effectiveness, they don&#039;t vary in their lack of membership in the far-reaching conspiracy to crank out mindless drones that he describes.  A pretty pedestrian set of incentives is all that is required for the generally poor educational outcomes in this country.  Tinfoil hats and Illuminati can be left out of the analysis, I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Phil, there&#039;s nothing wrong with trying to impress one&#039;s colleagues -- among other goals. It&#039;s when that&#039;s your only goal, or almost your only goal, that there&#039;s a problem. The reason that one person could do a better job of training teachers than all education professors put together, I submit, is that they cared far too much about impressing their colleagues and not nearly enough about other goals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the UK at least, teacher trainer/lecturers tend to be highly politically motivated, and almost always on the left. They can be reluctant to subject teaching approaches to fine-grained empirical analysis or value quantitative study (they prefer qualitative studies, as they highlight the experiences of valued social outliers). On my post-grad teacher training course, I was taught plenty about working class disengagement and its relation to the teaching of reading, but received little or no indication of the comparative success of different methods.

Bear in mind that not only education students but also their professors tend to be less able than their peers in other departments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is disappointing. The Cold Call technique listed in the article reminded me of a moment where my Communications professor had wondered (more to himself but in front of the class) better ways to teach us. He was doing pop quizzes with us and most of us didn&#039;t care enough to do well. I approached him the next class asking him to cold call us instead of asking us to raise hands and he regarded it apathetically and didn&#039;t implement it in the class. I felt bummed out about it. Got an A in his class but privately have thought of him as one of the worst teachers at my university. In spite of this, he remained popular because of his charisma.

Generally, I&#039;m incredibly skeptical whenever people say you either have it or you don&#039;t. I think growing up in a culture filled with data has made me wonder about specific techniques which people may unconsciously use to be successful in an activity.  

Given such mediocre products and processes coming from universities I wonder how a better university would workâ€”and how to finance and start one. But I digress. I&#039;ve got Lemov&#039;s book marked to get from the library whenever it comes out. Thanks for pointing it out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your mistake, Seth, is in believing &quot;educators&quot; have any interest in teaching, or in children learning.  Their whole focus is on driving out any initiative that might lead them to disrupt class or, later, society.  They&#039;ll mostly pick up reading, eventually, but that&#039;s no great shakes.  What matters is a supply of docile proles, and that 1848 never, ever happens again.]]></description>
