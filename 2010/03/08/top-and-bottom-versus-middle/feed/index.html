		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
Really interesting idea. Do you think this could also be applied to the medical research system? 

I work for a nonprofit organization (the Myelin Repair Foundation) which recently launched Where Are The Cures? (http://wherearethecures.org) to give patients (and friends/family) a voice and knowledge on how the medical research system is broken. 

As a nonprofit organization, the Myelin Repair Foundation (http://myelinrepair.org) is trying to speed up that process by bridging the gap between academic scientific discoveries and pharmaceutical companies. There are so many players in the process (NIH, FDA, other nonprofit disease research orgs, clinicians, patients, etc.) How could you create a Top &amp; Bottom vs. Middle in this system?

Empowerment in a workable system would be shared between patients and doctors. Presently all the POWER is held by the payers and rule makers who happen to be government regulators and insurers. Doctors have let the system be taken over by these entities. This has changed the way docs are able to care for their patients. Try going to a private solo doc who does not participate with the third parties and you may find a truly free and empowering system that works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed that about the &quot;How to Walk to School.&quot;  As an aside, I&#039;ve always found it notable that God delivered Israel from Egypt by parting the Red Sea, and THEN the 10 commandments came.  kind of like if you love and are grateful for what your neighbor, business partner, wife has given you,  you do not even need to be told not to kill, lie, steal, etc. . . . . . Anyway, I digress, as a Chicagoan, really interesting idea to help prevent the exodus of young vibrant families to the &#039;burbs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[doctorsh, that&#039;s an interesting point you make. However, I&#039;m not sure I completely understand, much less agree, without examples. For example, I don&#039;t know what you mean when you say obamacare will reduce patient power. Could you expand on what you mean?
I&#039;ve had plenty of experiences where patient empowerment would help. One involved a surgeon to whom I was referred:

http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/02/02/a-call-from-dr-eileen-consortis-office/

Another involved my dermatologist: He wasn&#039;t terribly interested in whether the drugs he prescribed actually worked. Which hurt me, of course. A third involved the mother of a friend of mine. She was given so many drugs they were actually killing her -- her doctors didn&#039;t notice. It was only discovered by accident.]]></description>
