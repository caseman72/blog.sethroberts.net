			<div class="entrytext">
				<p>My personal science introduced me to a research method I have never seen used in research articles or described in discussions of scientific method. It might be called <strong>wait and see</strong>. You measure something repeatedly, day after day, with the hope that at some point it will change dramatically and you will be able to determine why. In other words: 1. Measure something repeatedly, day after day. 2. When you notice an outlier, test possible explanations. In most science, random (= unplanned) variation is bad. In an experiment, for example, it makes the effects of the treatment harder to see. Here it is good.</p>
<p>Here are examples where wait and see paid off for me:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Acne and benzoyl peroxide</strong>. When I was a graduate student, I started counting the number of pimples on my face every morning. One day the count improved. It was two days after I started using benzoyl peroxide more regularly. Until then, I did not think benzoyl peroxide worked well &#8212; I started using it more regularly because I had run out of tetracycline (which turned out not to work).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Sleep and breakfast</strong>. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/">I changed my breakfast from oatmeal to fruit</a> because a student told me he had lost weight eating foods with high water content (such as fruit). I did not lose weight but my sleep suddenly got worse. I started waking up early every morning instead of half the time. From this I figured out that any breakfast, if eaten early, disturbed my sleep.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Sleep and standing</strong> (twice). <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/">I started to stand a lot to see if it would cause weight loss</a>. It didn&#8217;t, but I started to sleep better. Later, I discovered by accident that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/03/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">standing on one leg to exhaustion made me sleep better</a>.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Brain function and butter</strong>. For years I measured how fast I did arithmetic. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/13/arithmetic-and-butter/">One day I was a lot faster than usual. It turned out to be due to butter</a>.</p>
<p>5.<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/26/damage-due-to-mercury-revealed-by-brain-test/"><strong> Brain function and dental amalgam</strong></a>. My brain function, measured by an arithmetic test, improved over several months. I eventually decided that removal of two mercury-containing fillings was the likely cause.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Blood sugar and walking</strong>. My fasting blood sugar used to be higher than I would like &#8212; in the 90s. (Optimal is low 80s.) Even worse, it seemed to be increasing. (Above 100 is &#8220;pre-diabetic.&#8221;) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/">One day I discovered it was much lower than expected</a> (in the 80s). The previous day I had walked for an hour, which was unusual. I determined it was indeed cause and effect. If I walked an hour per day, my fasting blood sugar was much better.</p>
<p>This method and examples emphasize the point that different scientific methods are good at different things and we need all of them (in contrast to evidence-based medicine advocates who say some types of evidence are &#8220;better&#8221; than other types &#8212; implying one-dimensional evaluation). One thing we want to do is <strong>test cause-effect ideas</strong> (X causes Y). This method doesn&#8217;t do that at all. Experiments do that well, surveys are better than nothing. Another thing we want to do is <strong>assess the generality of our cause-effect ideas</strong>. This method doesn&#8217;t do that at all. Surveys do that well (it is much easier to survey a wide range of people than do an experiment with a wide range of people), multi-person experiments are better than nothing. A third thing we want to do is <strong>come up with cause-effect ideas worth testing</strong>. Most experiments are a poor way to do this, surveys are better than nothing. This method is especially good for that.</p>
<p>The possibility of such discoveries is a good reason to self-track. Professional scientists almost never use this method. But you can.</p>

			<p>Getting taken seriously when I do any self-tracking is an uphill battle when I&#8217;m dealing with arrogant jerks in long white coats (a.k.a. MDs).</p>
<p>They dismiss my experiences as anecdotal, and if I don&#8217;t slavishly follow their &#8220;doctor&#8217;s orders,&#8221; they call me noncompliant, nonadherent, crazy, and suicidal.</p>
<p>At that point, I have a name for them.</p>
<p>I call them my ex-doctors.</p>
<p>An arrogant jerk is still an arrogant jerk, even if the jerk wears a long white coat.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m interested in self-tracking, but I haven&#8217;t figured out HOW to do it (without it being too cumbersome / time consuming / inconvenient).  Is there something you&#8217;ve written (or someone else has written) that gives tips to a beginner?  I imagine you&#8217;ve learned a lot over years of doing this about what makes it easy enough to stick to.  </p>
<p>When you suggest that one measure something daily, then wait and see &#8230; well, I&#8217;m trying to think about what sorts of things are likely to be worth measuring.  I guess that depends on the individual, and what issues/problems they&#8217;d like to improve.  Sleep and mood are clearly useful ones.  Weight too&#8230;.  But I&#8217;m curious &#8211; what do YOU measure daily?  And &#8211; about how much time does your self-tracking take (not analyzing / making connections, just the stuff you record each day)?</p>

			<p>Seth, Im sorry, but I&#8217;m still a skeptic about your butter-arithmetic hypothesis, and your assertion that consuming butter makes you feel better.</p>
<p>In one of the Public Library of Science blogs, &#8220;Obesity Panacea,&#8221; a recent post called &#8220;Does thinking hard impact your heart?&#8221; made this statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;The results of this study suggest that an experimental mental work condition consisting of a 45-min period of reading and writing a summary, as other types of mental work (such as arithmetic) utilized in the laboratory, can modulate cardiovascular responses in healthy young adults through a reduction in cardiac parasympathetic activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, perhaps it is the mental work (arithmetic), not the butter, which makes you feel good. (But my long-ago calculus class at Duke in 1961-62 sure didn&#8217;t make me feel good. And the grade I got really made me feel bad.)</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/obesitypanacea/2012/08/09/does-thinking-hard-impact-your-heart/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.plos.org/obesitypanacea/2012/08/09/does-thinking-hard-impact-your-heart/</a><br />
<strong><br />
Seth: I believe butter makes me faster at arithmetic. From your comment I am unable to figure out why you question this. I have not studied mood effects of butter.</strong></p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve heard about that sort of neutral accumulation of data in studying nature&#8211; there are projects that keep track of bird-watching results. I&#8217;ve heard of another project of that sort done by scientists&#8211; I&#8217;ll post if I remember any more details.</p>
<p>The Longevity Project is probably another one.</p>
<p><strong>Seth: Many scientific projects collect data over long periods of time (years). In psychology this is called longitudinal research. In psychology at least, the people who do these studies don&#8217;t try to learn the cause of sudden changes (if any). In what I&#8217;ve seen, they ignore them. </strong></p>

			<p>I agree that data accumulation is a rare way to do science, and there should be more of it.<br />
<strong><br />
Seth: Data accumulation is common. Outlier investigation is rare.</strong></p>

			<p>Thanks for this post. Ever consider posting some of the templates you use for self-tracking?</p>
<p>Regarding one-legged standing, I&#8217;ve been doing it for a few days now and am getting restorative sleep that I have rarely had since childhood, where I was on my feet for a large chunk of the day playing. I wonder why I didn&#8217;t think of doing something so simple on my own; clearly it would have  helped to have used a journal.</p>

			<p>Seth, you wrote: &#8220;I measure daily: 1. weight. 2. fasting blood sugar. 3. sleep. 4. brain function. It takes about 7 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>1. is obvious.<br />
2. I&#8217;m interested in, but a Glucometer is expensive. Are you testing only once a day? When do you test?</p>
<p><strong>Seth: I test once/day at 8 am.</strong></p>
<p>3. I&#8217;ve heard you describe before. You record your subjective feeling of restedness on a scale from 0 to 100, including decimals (ie 97.5).<br />
4. You test with solving arithmetic in some program. Any chance you could share the details if not the program itself?</p>
<p><strong>Seth: I will soon announce a way that a small number of people can use the test I now use. I  no longer use an arithmetic test.</strong></p>
