		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Roberts,

When I consume 2 tablespoons of coconut oil at a time, it doesn&#039;t feel right and I get a stomach ache.  Is there a way to consume the coconut oil in one fell swoop and somehow mitigate this mild nausea?  I imagine the issue is consuming the oil on an empty stomach, but isn&#039;t that the point?

Thanks for your blog!

 - Ross

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The issue may be lack of the right enzymes for digesting it. Your body doesn&#039;t make enzymes it doesn&#039;t need. Start with a tiny amount of coconut oil -- that doesn&#039;t cause a stomach ache -- and gradually work up to 2 tablespoons.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth!
I have just read your book and I could not put it down!! I had been complaining recently that no one had yet made sense of the whole weight loss puzzle. People have got close but no one has put all the pieces together to make a coherent theory. 
And then I find this book - it is a mind blower and truly does make sense of all the facts about weight loss, everything fits and makes sense in this theory. 
I really do believe you&#039;ve hit the nail on the head. I&#039;m so glad you have because I had set myself a project to figure it all out - but I could never have come up with this - as it&#039;s coming from a different angle to the purely physiological. 
Quite honestly - I think you ought to be up for a Nobel prize or something - this information will be priceless to millions - once it becomes better known. 
I had just started &#039;The Carbohydrate Addict&#039;s Diet&#039; book before I read this and this is probably the second closest thing I have found to getting the full picture after your book. 
Your theory makes sense of all the observations about food cravings described in their book, for example; MSG , which intensifies flavours, leads to intense food cravings and weight gain. 
Totally brilliant - it&#039;s all starting to make sense :) 
Thanks so much - reading your book is one of the best things I&#039;ve ever done! 
I&#039;ll be back to post my own success with the diet - started yesterday and definitely noticed some appetite suppression already.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, Johanna, that&#039;s nice to hear. From your lips to God&#039;s ear.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had success on and off on the shangri-la diet.  I usually stop because of stress in life leads me back to old habits of anxious snacking and bad habits of diet soda and smoking at nigh cut into that 1 hour window of non-flavors.  I&#039;ve tried every diet imaginable, but really do prefer the SLD due to it&#039;s simplicity, cost effectiveness and only small amounts of exercise.   My only curiosity is whether or not it works because of the aspect of our paying more detail to our diet and true hunger or the actual flavorless calories.  All in all, I do want to enjoy my food, and seem to be losing out on the positive effects of tasty foods.  Also, is it the fat content that suppresses appetite.

Lately I have found my best formula in a long time.  I take about 10 grams of fish oil first thing in the morning, then a couple of eggs with some cheese on Scandinavian Bran Crispbread.  This combo leaves me filled and satisfied throughout the day.  Only diet soda, tea and maybe some peanuts during the rest of the day.  I&#039;m single and work nights, so it has not been a social problem.  I would imagine I&#039;ll continue to make changes, but I have lost 25 pounds since early January.  I usually weigh around 250 and am 6&#039; 2&quot;.  I do want to add the SLD in combination again and see what happens.  

By the way, my sleep has been much better than in a long time.  I think the vitamin D and late sleeping has been beneficial, along with the high Omega 3 content, which I take for my bipolar.  I will add the SLD and give a later update.

Thanks Seth.]]></description>
