		<description><![CDATA[Alexis, I can see your point about motivation hacks potentially cutting off useful signals sent by unmotivation, and about blindness to the unmeasured areas of life. I use other tools (like daily journaling, happiness/health tracking, and time set aside for faraway thinking) to be strategic about those things, which I think is better. But certainly it should be pointed out that one should not blindly hack productivity without another way of getting perspective.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very interested in this but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s a feature or a bug that the system results in feeling &quot;great&quot; about working 70 hours a week. 

Perhaps it is a way to become pleasantly addicted to extremely hard work, but that&#039;s a dangerous power. I was working about 60-75 hours/week doing ios development over Jan &amp; Feb, and in the end I was sick (but I&#039;m not in my exactly young).

Also, I worry that using monitoring to drive up efficiency means you get very efficient at what you can monitor, and crowd out all slack which is valuable over the longer term for creativity even if it&#039;s benefit harder to monitor. Reading this post, for instance, would not count as productive.

That said, if there were a good app for this, I&#039;d be trying it tomorrow.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The percentile feedback actually worked very well for me.
I used your R scripts on Max OS X.

I have a two-display set-up, so I dragged the window with the chart to the second display, so that it wasn&#039;t obscured by other windows. This was a critical factor for me to make this system effective. When I started to see the productivity chart all the time, it started to be much more motivating.]]></description>
