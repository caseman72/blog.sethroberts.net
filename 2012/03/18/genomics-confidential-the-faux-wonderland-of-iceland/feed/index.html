		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I have seen nothing that suggests genes make a big difference in any common disease and plenty that suggests environment makes a big difference.&quot; 

You are dead right about this. The more we learn about epigenetics, the less our previous model of genetic determinism makes sense. We know beyond a doubt that gene expression can be turned off and on (it&#039;s an essential part of how we determine a gene&#039;s function in the first place). Any given gene&#039;s function is affected by other genes and by the cellular environment. 

What we learn from genetic studies in the future may help us understand the mechanisms of how gene expression can be modified by behavior, but it&#039;s missing the big picture-- that behavior can change gene expression, and thus every bodily process! 

I&#039;m interested in JRM&#039;s example: &quot;I have a gene that reduces the efficiency of vitamin K recycling. Guess what? Liquid vitamin K2 drops is one of the few supplements where I notice the effects.&quot; Did you experiment with vitamin K2 drops before you received your genetic analysis, or after?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe it won&#039;t change medicine, but it is extremely interesting nonetheless.
I just got my 23andme results back.  One of the things they look at is warfarin sensitivity.  I have a gene that reduces the efficiency of vitamin K recycling.  Guess what?  Liquid vitamin K2 drops is one of the few supplements where I notice the effects.  Before, I always had chapped lips.  Personal genomics has the potential to indicate which supplements would be most useful.
What else?  I apparently have some gene variants for increased intelligence.  Over time, personal genomics will help break the taboo on differences in IQ.  
I am a carrier for cystic fibrosis.  The gene affects transport of chloride ions.  Personally, I am neurotic about salt intake.  It has to be just right.  If I eat fruit, I need to balance it with salt because the potassium in fruit throws off the electrolyte balance.  CF sufferers produce mucus in excess.  So, I imagine that carriers still produce abnormal amounts of mucus.  This would provide an explanation of why I suffered chronic ear infections as a child.  Mucus would block the Eustachian tube creating a breeding ground for bacteria.  Of course, it was&#039;t the sole cause.  Mucus producing foods such as dairy would also be a cause.  Since going paleo, it is not a problem anymore.  
What else?  One of the reasons I got tested was to see if I had genes for hemochromatosis.  I don&#039;t.  So I can keep on eating my 1.5 pounds of meat a day.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You sound like an extremely sophisticated consumer of genetics information. Yet even for you the only practical benefit seems to be what you say in the last three sentences: &quot;One of the reasons I got tested was to see if I had genes for hemochromatosis.  I don&#039;t.  So I can keep on eating my 1.5 pounds of meat a day.&quot; I wonder why you think we know everything about &quot;genes for hemochromatosis&quot;. How much variance do the hemochromatosis genes we know about explain? what if they explain only 10% of the variance? If I were worried about too much iron in my blood I would simply have it measured. So even your one practical example doesn&#039;t make sense. I&#039;m not saying the info isn&#039;t interesting...but the defenders of its practical value seem to have a hard time being convincing.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Parents increase their child&#039;s risk of coronary heart disease through their genes and not through the family&#039;s diet or lifestyle

a study of more than 80,000 men and women who were adopted as children showed that susceptibility to the disease is transmitted in the womb and not in the home.

They found that adoptees who had at least one biological parent with CHD had up to 60 per cent more chance of suffering the disease themselves, compared with a control group.
In contrast, growing up in a home with adoptive parents who suffered from CHD resulted in no additional risk for the child, even if both parents had the disease.

		<description><![CDATA[Michael Rose found that he could breed longer living fruit flies by natural selection (http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/06/science/06conv.html?pagewanted=all),  so it is not that far-fetched to think there could be something in the genome to account for longevity.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: No doubt genes influence longevity. But how much -- the size of the effect -- is important. Is the genetic influence on longevity like pieces of gold laying on the sidewalk (high benefit/cost ratio) or like the gold found in seawater (low benefit/cost of extraction ratio)? In other words, how does studying genetic effects on longevity compare to studying other effects (e.g., nutritional effects) on longevity?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
