		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, 

I am learning R now, and finding that having a Google form synced to my iphone, which I can then read into R is a flexible way to collect data.

What tools or publications would you recommend for learning more about data analysis and visualization. I&#039;ve been reading the R blogs. In my psych education I received the SPSS approach you critique. 

Thanks, 

Brian
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Exploratory Data Analysis by John Tukey is pretty good. It is a strange subject, data analysis: Those who do it all the time (practicing scientists) don&#039;t write about it -- they don&#039;t write statistics books or even articles -- and those who write about it (the authors of statistics books) appear to do not much of it. For a long time statistics textbooks used made-up examples, presumably because their authors had so little contact with actual examples. Psychology professors don&#039;t seem to entirely realize their advantage (considerable experience with actual data) because when they write about statistics they often imitate statistics professors -- e.g., most intro stats texts written by psych professors imitate intro stats texts written by stats professors.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just wondered if you&#039;re familiar with KXEN and whether they&#039;re making inroads into academic circles.

Also have you tried Tableau for going over the data visually? It&#039;s my personal favourite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing that might help would be if someone could identify a book or resource that would educate work-a-day computer programmers on data analysis. I think we&#039;re special and deserving of a special book just for us. We are capable of implementing analysis if it&#039;s described to us, but woefully incapable of applying it to real data. It&#039;s a painful blind spot for me. 

For instance, I find this very interesting:

http://blog.linkibol.com/2010/05/07/how-to-build-a-popularity-algorithm-you-can-be-proud-of/

But the best I could do would be to pick one and implement. I don&#039;t get much insight from reading it.
