		<description><![CDATA[First and foremost; Seth, I thank you for sharing.

May of last year til August of last year, I was on 4000IU D3 and 1000mg/q12hr. I was ok but still sluggish and work at night and sometimes with an OT. Since I am diabetic II and loosing weight it isn&#039;t working on my favor.

October of last year, I was tweaking with OTC med for a month. I increased my D3 to 10,000 (q12hrs) and Lovaza 2gm(q12hrs) and Multivitamins with D 400IU as well as cooking mushrooms as meat substitute. this one works for me quite well my energy is back 200%. Being said, I have lost almost 20lbs in two months. 

Addendum: My Dr is well aware of my OTC and Rx meds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I began taking mega doses of Barleans fish oil in the morning a few weeks after increasing the D3 to 5000.  I&#039;ve never fell asleep so fast and deep as I have now.  I&#039;m 38, bipolar and am off ambien and benedryl just recently.  I do take a small amount of melatonin.  The only problem is I sleep at least 9 hours a night and am quite slow in the mornings.  It&#039;d take this anyday over the chronic insomnia.

Thanks for the article Seth and the sharing Ase.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for reporting your experience. Your immune system is probably working much better now than when you had chronic insomnia.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is all so interesting.  When I read about the vitamin D on your blog this fall, I went out and got me a bottle from the local supermarket (in Sweden).  What caught my eye then was that I hoped it would help with my around 3 pm slump, which was so bad I basically could not work beyond it.  OK, maybe I could, but it would be hard concentrating, and I would need a nap, and by that time I needed to go home anyway...

I started taking 1 in the morning, with my cup of sugar water, and fish oil capsules that I use for the SLD (which has gotten me down from slightly overweight, to normal weight, and my waist is now roughly where I expect it to be).  And, I do think it improved the afternoon slump rather quickly. 

But, nothing for the night.  I never had sleeping problems earlier (except during pregnancy).  It took 3 kids for me to become sleep-deprived.  But, I have been having a hard time sleeping, and also of waking up multiple times.  

I upped the intake to 4 tablets - but that just hurt my stomach.  I have eased back - between 2 and 3.  And, there may be an improvement.  Not back to where I used to be, but fewer waking up in the night.  But, not as noticeable as the lesser afternoon slump (or finding my waist).]]></description>
