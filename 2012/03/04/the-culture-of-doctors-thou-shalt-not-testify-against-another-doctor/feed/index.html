		<description><![CDATA[The other thing that doctors do is give you a negative diagnosis, deliberately saying things are worse than they are.  If you survive or do well, then you have done better than expected and will be happy.  If you don&#039;t, then you did as predicted and are less likely to blame them.

This, in spite of the research indicating that positive predictions improve patient health.  I remember sitting there, listening as a faculty member at a medical school explained that to me, in between his classes teaching ethics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Doctors are squarely in the &quot;guardian&quot; group, and (mostly) operate under its morality as described by Jacobs. This includes accepting money only at arm&#039;s length (indirectly via insurance), and active deception &quot;for the greater good,&quot; as you have described here.

This is fine if we trust these men as the most intelligent, moral, and capable beings on earth. If not, we have a serious problem, which is further exacerbated when doctors begin operating under a blend of both moralities--protecting each other and maximizing profits--without concern for the welfare of the patients they are sworn to protect. 

If understood in light of Jacobs&#039; theory, this is the most rational argument, in my mind, for placing healthcare completely in the hands of (local) government, along with all other guardian functions, like military and police. As I argue at length at my blog, there is little difference between viral invaders that plan to kill us, and men with guns planning our demise. We need guardians to protect us from both dangers, regardless of their size.]]></description>
