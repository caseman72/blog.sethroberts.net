Mmmmm eggs are good though...fish-finger sandwich with a cooked egg with runny yolk..the food of kings..!..

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: A rat liked scrambled eggs. I thought that translated into good advice: eat eggs.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tend to eat more raw egg yolks than whites myself, but I don&#039;t currently discard all raw egg whites. Here is some info to consider that&#039;s counter to the standard view of raw egg whites as mostly or completely harmful and cooking as a total solution to the alleged problem:

Even Mark Sisson says at that above link: &quot;If you like raw eggs, I’d say have at it – with the above info in mind.&quot;

&quot;Let&#039;s start with one simple idea: Mother Nature isn&#039;t stupid. She didn&#039;t make human beings the only species that prefers foods that will kill us.&quot; -Tom Naughton

Cooking doesn&#039;t destroy all egg white avidin:

&quot;It is a myth that light cooking completely destroys the avidin. According to this study (http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119344834/abstract?), poaching eggs only destroys one third of the avidin while even frying leaves 30 percent of it behind.&quot; (The Incredible, Edible Egg Yolk, July, 2005, by Chris Masterjohn, http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Egg_Yolk.html)

Raw egg whites may actually provide benefits:

&quot;Heck, even — shudder — raw egg whites may give a glutathione boost in some people comparable to that given by raw milk! ....

Raw Egg White — The Trusty Sidekick?
The researchers searched over thirty publications identifying the sequences of edible plant and animal proteins and concluded that the only two types of protein in the food supply containing these unique bonds are whey proteins and egg white proteins.  They noted the following:

&#039;It may also be noteworthy that from time immemorial, whey from raw milk and/or undenatured raw egg white have been administered to children and to the sick as prophylactic or therapeutic measures in folk medicine.&#039;&quot; (The Biochemical Magic of Raw Milk and Other Raw Foods: Glutathione, September 11, 2010, by Chris Masterjohn, http://www.westonaprice.org/blogs/cmasterjohn/2010/09/11/the-biochemical-magic-of-raw-milk-and-other-raw-foods-glutathione)

Wild animals and hunter gatherers don&#039;t restrict themselves to eating only infertile eggs, the way most modern Americans do. One difference between conventional supermarket chicken eggs and the wild eggs that primates and other wild animals eat in the wild, is that most supermarket eggs are infertile and restricted to a narrow range of egg development. It turns out that fertile eggs contain less avidin than infertile eggs (The Merck Veterinary Manual, http://merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/171406.htm).

Wild animals don&#039;t restrict themselves at all to any particular stage of development in the egg cycle. They eat anything that won&#039;t fight back so much as to be a serious threat. Thus, they eat some of their eggs in the fertile stage or beyond (see also Balut http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balut_(egg)), maybe most of them. Luckily, fertile eggs are increasingly available in the USA.

&quot;Maybe fertilized eggs would be helpful for folks who want to down a lot of raw whites without worrying about inducing biotin deficiency.&quot; -Denise Minger 

&quot;An egg seems intuitively analogous to a seed, so it seems like fertilization should neutralize the anti-nutrients like sprouting does to seeds. That’s a good topic to research for another blog post perhaps!&quot; -Chris Masterjohn 

&quot;Dr. Sharma, PhD, who is a biochemist with Bayer, contacted me about this issue. His investigation into the matter revealed that there is not enough biotin in an egg yolk to bind to all the avidin present in the raw whites. He found that 5.7 grams of biotin are required to neutralize all the avidin found in the raw whites of an average-sized egg. There are only about 25 micrograms -- or 25 millionths of a gram -- of biotin in an average egg yolk.&quot; http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2005/02/09/raw-eggs.aspx

It will be interesting to see what results Seth&#039;s raw vs. cooked egg experiment produces. It&#039;s refreshing to find someone who doesn&#039;t jump to conclusions before he has done any testing. For it to be a relatively fair test, he should presumably use fertile, pasture-raised chicken eggs, or perhaps other high-quality eggs like free-range duck eggs.]]></description>

I do avoid raw egg whites as avidin can cause biotin depletion. Mark Sisson has a good article explaining it.

It seems like the best of both worlds is sunny side up or poached.

		<description><![CDATA[I concur with Tucker Max, at least on the difference between pastured eggs, and not.  We have chickens in our backyard...they live on grass, bugs, weeds, etc...and the eggs aren&#039;t even recognizeable as the same type of food as store fed, even &quot;Free Range&quot; ones.  

1.  The yolks are impossible to describe as yellow.  I&#039;m pretty sure yellow yolks are a strong indicator that the chicken producing them is undernourished.  Think orange, like the fruit.

2.  My wife has an egg alergy, getting pimples if she eats many store-bought eggs.  Not true of our backyard chickens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; the very first time I did it was at night, like 9pm, and I couldn’t get to sleep until 3am I had such a huge burst of energy. It’s not quite like that anymore

Yeah, that&#039;s how the placebo effect works for me too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How and where do you get eggs you trust to be salmonella free? I&#039;m living in NYC, and I can&#039;t seem to find in-shell pasteurized eggs anywhere.

Given how horrible chicken raising conditions in the US are (even the so called &quot;cage free&quot; ones - 15 minutes a day outside the regular cage is enough for that designation), how do you trust your eggs to be disease free?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I eat my eggs scambled OR raw, but when I eat&#039;m raw I only eat the yolk. It&#039;s a Spanish snack: Huevo con miel ( http://www.spain-in-iowa.com/2011/04/huevo-con-miel-raw-egg-yolk-with-honey/ )

I don&#039;t think that raw egg whites are good. I&#039;m not sure about it, but I think I read somewhere that the egg white should be heated before consumption. 

I like the taste of a raw yolk, it&#039;s basically the same as &quot;sunny side up&quot;! I don&#039;t like the taste and texture of the egg white. Just the yolk for me, with some salt most of the time!]]></description>
