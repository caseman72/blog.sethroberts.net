		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I was surprised about how you didn&#039;t repudiate the &quot;n=1&quot; rhetoric before. It&#039;s simply wrong. The number of observations is not equal to the number of people with self-experimentation, since it&#039;s not cross-sectional data. Self-experimentation means a possibly large and growing &quot;n&quot;, all on the most relevant subject - yourself.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It&#039;s a subtle thing. Experiments with one subject are called &quot;n = 1&quot;. Yet experiments done in only one lab are not called &quot;n = 1&quot;. Is &quot;n = 1&quot; derogatory? Or does it just serve to identify a certain kind of experiment? Not obvious.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
