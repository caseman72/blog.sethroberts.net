		<description><![CDATA[Tom: I believe the scatter you see in HDL reflects actual physiological changes.  The device has very little variance from test to test in that measurement.  Part of why the skew in HDL reflects other experiments during the red time series (my second post is about that).  I have an idea about where the rest of the skew comes from and will post a follow-up if I can figure it out.  The non-HDL number (i.e. the total cholesterol measurement minus the HDL) is much less accurate and the device seems to contribute considerable variance.  With enough data points I think the readings are useful.

Dustin: my doctor told me some of his patients have had similar results from butter consumption.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had a similar result with butter consumption.  I did a brain function month trial of eating a half cube a day and (w/out planning) ended up getting a lipid profile pretty much exactly at the end of it.  Both LDL and HDL were the best they have ever been for me.  In fact on my whole blood report there was only one thing in the &quot;warning&quot; column and humorously that was a note that my risk of a heart attack was less that 1/2 of the average.

On a related note I always find it funny when people ask how can you possibly stand eating that much butter in a day.  I vaguely remember having to hide the butter in bread or other things the first week or two, but by the end of the month I was totally addicted to plain butter by the slice.  In fact, while I&#039;m happy that it is good for my brain and my body I now find it hard to pass by the fridge w/out sneaking a slice of butter (at least several times a day).  My kids are slowly acquiring a butter addiction as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[seth, 
  when you consumer butter is it by cooking or just eating it raw?  does it matter?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t know if it matters. I eat it raw (with small pieces of meat.)&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That home device sure has a lot more scatter than the lab tests.  I suppose we&#039;d like to have the lab be more precise than we can be at home, wouldn&#039;t we?

Seth, I don&#039;t remember your figures.  How do these results compare with your own changes?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I didn&#039;t measure the effect of butter on my HDL, etc. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
