		<description><![CDATA[This person misunderstands the purpose of a hospital. Patients are kept admitted to the hospital for medical care, not help with activities of daily living. If a patient can&#039;t manage ADLs, they need a caregiver or nursing home. She will not find a hospital that is willing to keep her admitted for the entire recovery. This is her own fault for being unwilling to use a skilled nursing facility/rehab center, which is a very common and normal thing to do, and not the fault of the hospital for providing poor &quot;customer service.&quot; Rather, the hospital would have been negligent to perform a procedure on a patient that had no way to meet her care needs at home. Another option would have been to hire a visiting nurse or home health aid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In mice (as mentioned above):

http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/blog/dr-charles-mobbs-diabetic-kidney-damage-can-actually-be-reversed-with-a-high-fat-low-carb-ketogenic-diet/10660

You&#039;ll get a kick out of that one.  Of course he doesn&#039;t want to put actual *humans* on a ketogenic diet, he want to develop a drug...

In humans:

&quot;Pete is a 30 YO male, 175cm tall, 110kg (I can’t tell you hw depressing and embarrassing it is that the US can’t figure out the metric system) and pretty much a mess. He is sedentary, stressed, has terrible sleep and exists on packaged pastry products and beverages with “DEW, Pepper” and similar monikers. Recently Pete had to get a physical and he had: high blood pressure, elevated: blood glucose, BUN, creatinine. Given that his condition was obviously not good it was recommended that his renal function get checked out. Tests indicated Pete was operating on approximately 10% of normal kidney function. Pete was pretty shaken up by his condition…peri-diabetic, facing dialysis ( his doctor wanted to start dialysis IMMEDIATELY) and all at the ripe old age of 30. Fortunately for Pete, his employer was a member at a wacky little gym called NorCal Strength &amp; Conditioning and the employers offered to not only pick up his gym membership for a few months, but would pay Pete on an incentive basis: $5 for every pound lost. This is a small IT company, and I’m sure this situation violated multiple California state “fair employment” laws…but it’s what happened here. Pete went through an initial assessment at NorCal, and it was recommended that he work with Amy Kubal on his nutrition. The course of action involved a low protein (10-15% protein) low carb ( less than 10%) high fat (mainly from coconut products), ketogenic diet. Pete’s doctor was horrified, but we petitioned for one month of “tinkering” to see how things went. Three weeks later Pete’s GFR was 80% of normal instead of the previous 10% and his BUN was within normal ranges. His doctor was interested…but baffled. Pete has subsequently titrated up his protein intake with no ill effects on kidney function.&quot;

http://www.robbwolf.com/2011/06/16/clearing-up-kidney-confusion-part-deux/

&quot;Anyway, the first thing to do with a paper like this is to check whether the authors cited Nielsen&#039;s 2006 case report of a human being having their diabetic renal failure halted and partially reversed. I mean, this might be relevant... 

They didn&#039;t.&quot;

 
http://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com/2011/04/diabetic-nephropathy-and-lost-swede.html

 
I hadn&#039;t kept up with the comments on your post... Sorry for being unnecessarily cryptic.

The fascinating thing from Mobbs work was the importance of keeping protein very low, since protein in excess of dietary requirements was converted to glucose, which is what was poisoning the kidneys... Remove the glucose, kidneys heal.

And to Wilbur: All case reports, or any published science, is an anecdote.  What&#039;s important in science in reproducibility.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wilbur, yes, anecdotes are not necessarily clinically valuable. But as Seth points out, if the alternative treatment suggested does no harm on its own, there&#039;s only upside. I really don&#039;t get this attitude. 

My mom&#039;s kidneys were beginning to lose function last year. For various reasons, I suspected she had a problem with gluten. Her doctor offered no real advice, other than &#039;when they actually fail you will need dialysis etc.&#039; He offered no other treatment possibilities. He suggested she lose a little weight , although she wasn&#039;t particularly overweight. (Maybe 15 extra lbs.)  

I insisted she adopt a paleo-ish diet, with gluten avoidance being the priority. A year later, she feels better in many ways, and has improved her kidney performance substantially. Her GFR has improved from 31, which is moderate-to-severe, to 62, which is mild kidney disease. Apparently this kind of improvement is vanishingly rare for a 70-yr old. 

So I&#039;ll take that anecdote, thank you very much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Reversal of Diabetic Nephropathy by a Ketogenic Diet [in mice]...

...Diabetic nephropathy, as indicated by albumin/creatinine ratios as well as expression of stress-induced genes, was completely reversed by 2 months maintenance on a ketogenic diet.&quot;

Paper can be found at PLOS One.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, Dennis, that&#039;s good to know. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0018604&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The paper&lt;/a&gt; was published in 2011. Three of the authors are from a neurobiology department.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
