		<description><![CDATA[When you cast about for a good to say in a person&#039;s defense and the best you can come up with is a single instance of epistemic luck, well, as I said: no praise is plenty.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I wasn&#039;t casting about. I posted that link weeks before Rush&#039;s current problems. There is a backlog of posts, that&#039;s why it appeared recently&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If no praise had ever been written about Rush, too much praise would already have been written.

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, I agree completely. It is no longer a good idea to attend most modern universities. 

I suspect that in the future, college will become compulsory in the same way that American grade-school was at one time provided by the private market, and has since become a forced part of every American child&#039;s life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I had been asked that question, I would&#039;ve replied yes to only about 5% of my classes.

I don&#039;t think college Is about educating people anymore. I think at this point it exists just to feed millions of unsuspecting people into gigantic loans that cannot be discharged by bankruptcy. It is the new slavery.

		<description><![CDATA[Why is that a scary thought?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It is a scary thought because of the emptiness -- lack of overlap between what is taught and what students want to learn -- it might expose.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
