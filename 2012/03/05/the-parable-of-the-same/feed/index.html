		<description><![CDATA[It must have been that the Twinlab product contained something active other than SAM-e, or consumerlab&#039;s tests for SAM-e are dreadfully inaccurate. They tested about 15 different brands and only a few failed; the rest contained the stated amounts of SAM-e according to their method:

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s fascinating. Thanks.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I trained as an Occupational Therapist, one of the things we were warned about was that not all prescription drugs are equal - sadly the fillers and colours can change the drugs affect/ absorption rate etc. I was working in the NHS at the time NICE came into being, which was going to limit people&#039;s (and their doctors&#039;) choice of manufacturer of their drug, and we knew that many people were going to get a less satisfactory outcome. 

I personally have a problem with drugs with a pink colouring - it slows the absorption rate for me. I found this out with Indomethecin - our British &#039;cheap&#039; indomethecin has bright pink colour on it, and takes about 45 mins to start to help me, whereas the &#039;white&#039; ones start to work in 10 mins. This is a serious delay for any drug with a time base to it. Luckily I have a very on-the-ball pharmacist who hunts out and stocks the &#039;right&#039; coloured medication for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Market forces driving real quality, is a myth.

The places I have worked, have confused quality with satisfying and fooling customers. This is often called TQM, Total Quality Management.

The bosses have also been mainly concerned with having alpha primate status, and considers real quality improvement to be a threat to their status.

All this nonsense of the pharmaceutical industry, the climate scam, the military industiral complex, corrupt doctors, etc., are not aberrations. They are rather typical of most work today, in my experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What brands did she try? Surely someone makes a high quality SAMe today. Did she try Jarrow? Consult consumerlabs.com?

Perhaps twin labs&#039; version was actually the wrong chemical?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: She tried all brands for sale in the US.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; 2. So much for the placebo effect.

Que? I see zero mention of anything like blinding.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: All brands should have been equally effective placebos.
&lt;/strong&gt;
(Some Muslims get so upset about some cartoons being drawn or books being burned they will kill dozens of people over it. Proof that paper is a drug more powerful than testosterone or steroids at inducing rage!)
