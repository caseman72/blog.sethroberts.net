		<description><![CDATA[I used Moodscope for a few months, as I was learning to cope without SSRI&#039;s after a 4 year period with miserable, life-limiting depression.

I haven&#039;t used it for about 3 months now - principally because its user interface is REALLY IRRITATING!  For those who don&#039;t know it, Moodscope presents a set of 20 choices to make in random order.  Half of these are positive (&quot;inspired&quot;, &quot;attentive&quot;), and half negative (&quot;hostile&quot;, &quot;nervous&quot;) on a scale of 1..4, from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;very&quot;.

I know WHY the interface is this way, but selecting a score is VERY TEDIOUS for this late-50&#039;s computer scientist. Each card has two scores on each of two virtual faces and is presented in a random orientation, so to select a score, I need to &quot;flip&quot; and &quot;rotate&quot; the card until the score I wish to select is at the top and then click on it.

At the end of the process, Moodscope presents a score, between 0% and 74%, which used to pretty closely mirror the way I was feeling. So, for me personally, the pain of clicking irritating cards outweighed the benefits of getting an objective measure of my mood.  The graph of mood over time was interesting, but not compelling.

I see Moodscope is now advertising paid subscriptions for premium services. I haven&#039;t played with those.

The value of sharing?  Sharing a mood is a VERY intimate thing to do.  I experimented it for a while - one person was simply not interested, and another was interested enough to respond, but I didn&#039;t find the interactions helpful or unhelpful.

I think I&#039;d have carried on with Moodscope, but not with sharing, had it been possible for me to enter the data more conveniently.  Typing this has (almost) encouraged me to set up a google spreadsheet for the purpose...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my god I hate people who use my mood against me in constructive debates. Like any argument is moot just because I&#039;m not super happy at that exact moment? 

Even my mom does it at times, &quot;I&#039;ll come back when you&#039;re in a better mood&quot; I mean, why are my opinions of less value at that point?

Anyway, it&#039;s very interesting to see the effects of a scientific study of moods, although I would imagine there&#039;s quite an ambiguity among people - like how would you define your moods? For some you need to be REALLY pissed off to be angry, whilst some find it easy and natural.

In any way it&#039;s something to look out for, particularly in the field of mood related disorders - let&#039;s just not hope that everyone starts seeing bipolarity in themselves.

		<description><![CDATA[Well said! And this applies to innovation and improvement in all areas of life. It is exactly why economies &quot;stagnate&quot;--because industries gradually come to organize themselves as if they were government departments, often with explicit support from governments.  Modern medicine and public schooling are good examples of this process, but it can happen to any business, any time the focus is removed from individuals. 

Guardian syndrome morality does not allow innovation except by elite leaders. Commercial syndrome morality allows for more innovation (wealth creation) by allowing everyone to create innovative products and ideas-- not just the men at the top of the pyramid.

If individuals lose their ability to innovate and create solutions to problems, the growth of the economy slows--precisely because a &quot;growing economy&quot; is just another way to say &quot;lots of people finding ways to make life better for each other.&quot; 

And this is why half the nation feels that reducing government is stimulating to an economy--because they recognize that wealth (new and useful stuff) depends on the creativity of individuals, not just leaders.]]></description>
