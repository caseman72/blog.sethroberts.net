		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I learned a few things but his weird idea that “there are no genes for food intolerance” makes me wonder about everything else he says.&quot;

I like that idea.  I&#039;ve often explained to people who tell me that celiac is a genetic condition that this is logically equivalent to saying that a person who falls to his death died of a genetic condition: his genes didn&#039;t give him wings.

Wheat&#039;s a toxic plant.  It&#039;s hardly surprising that we can&#039;t digest it, but that fact doesn&#039;t mean there&#039;s a gene that&#039;s responsible for gluten intolerance.

On a related note, you might find this interesting:

&quot;IBS and Gluten Intolerance&quot;

My IBS is food-triggered.  Either wheat or seed oils sets it off, wheat is worse.  I suspect IBS is simply one manifestation of wheat poisoning (goat-grass poisoning, to be correct), and celiac is another.  Which effect you have is determined by your genes, of course...

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: yes, it is misleading to call celiac disease a genetic condition. But unlike wings, a certain gene that makes you more susceptible to celiac disease is quite common.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife suffers from chronic digestive problems, probably IBS (other possible diagnoses have been ruled-out by tests).  She finds significant relief from drinking kombucha.  Before trying kombucha, she tried various drugs -- to no effect.  She also tried soy yogurt and various probiotics sold at health food stores, but none of those treatments had any effect.

Drinking kombucha is not a cure.   She drinks eight or ten ounces every day, but she still has flare-ups of her symptoms.  Nevertheless, she&#039;s much better now than before.  She also eats kim chee and miso soup, but we haven&#039;t tried to isolate the effects (if any) of those foods, and she doesn&#039;t eat them daily.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I suggest eating several fermented foods daily, not just kombucha. Kefir is easy to consume and easy to make.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How do (non-dairy) fermented foods fit in our evolutionary history?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Early in evolution, I believe more fermented foods were chosen over less fermented foods, when both were available -- because the more fermented foods tasted better. Call it accidental fermentation. For example, old fruit was chosen over fresh fruit. Later in evolution, I believe foods were deliberately fermented, as they are now.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
