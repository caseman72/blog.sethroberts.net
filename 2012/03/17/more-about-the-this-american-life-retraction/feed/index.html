		<description><![CDATA[TAL&#039;s audience wants to a) feel good about liking This American Life and b) feel OK about using Apple products. Scapegoating Daisey kills two birds with one stone. But it seems to me the producers are just as much to blame as Daisey for this story being presented as &quot;journalism.&quot;

Tom, if you listen to the retraction show, Daisey quite evidently feels shame.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;The producers are just as much to blame.&quot; I agree and have yet to see this point made even once in all the journalistic comment (e.g., James Fallows, The New Yorker). Apparently journalists prefer to blame non-journalists (Daisey) for bad journalism. It doesn&#039;t make complete sense but there it is.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like your Michael Jordan example and will probably use it elsewhere. Firsthand testimony is a powerful thing. 

Or imagine applying Daisey&#039;s technique to the US military. Take the worst examples of injured soldiers that you could find in the news anywhere in the country over a few-year period. Tell a story in which you personally met all of these people as individuals, in a context that suggests the injury rate must be many orders of magnitude higher than it is. Give those soldiers words and actions that fill out the needs of your story to make it especially poignant and close with a call-to-action to email some high mucky-muck to &quot;do something&quot;. Come to think of it, I&#039;d be surprised if this hasn&#039;t been done yet. Somebody call Michael Moore, I&#039;ve got a pitch for him... :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like this guy&#039;s analysis of of the Daisey lies.    

www.insidehighered.com/blogs/education-oronte-churm/mike-daisey-liar-and-so-am-i

Advocates like Daisey, Mortenson, Frey, Breitbart, and Gleick make it difficult to understand the truth when looking at issues like the Keystone oil pipeline.  Each side spins a believable tale.  But what source can we trust, when no news organizations pay for decent fact-checking any more?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wonderful post Seth! I think you are correct. A bias for the simple story is behind a lot of this. Life is complicated!  That takes a lot of the &quot;conspiracy type thinking out of the equation.&quot;  I had as default model &quot;journalists are dumb&quot; but I have had some really sharp students as declared journalism majors so I was always troubled by my &quot;simple story&quot;.
p.s. Thanks so much for Shangri-La! The flax oil has raised my HDL, allowed me feel in control of my weight, and improved my gums. My dentist  after a 2-3 year absence by me asked &quot;who is taking care of my teeth.&quot; No one but the flax oil, brushing, and Seth! Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nancy, agreed.

Interestingly, the Public, the theater where Daisey is currently performing (the show closes Sunday) revealed yesterday that they also hadn&#039;t known that he was lying in his monologue about what he had witnessed, saying &quot;...we wish he had been more precise with us and our audiences about what was and wasn’t his personal experience in the piece.&quot;

So even the playhouse was expecting a higher level of integrity.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;So even the playhouse was expecting a higher level of integrity.&quot; That&#039;s a good way of putting it. There is such a thing as too much dramatic license. And Daisey&#039;s defense that his work is &quot;theatre&quot; does not please an actual theatre owner.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is a continuing trend:  Gleick and his fabricated Heartland memo, Breitbert and his out-of-context editing of Sherrod&#039;s speech, and now Daisey and his spin on Apple factories.  These people created lies to tell what they consider to be the true underlying story; they were motivated to influence the world to make it better.   

Interestingly enough, the brilliant David Simon in his &#039;The Wire&#039; series developed the character of a reporter, Scott Templeton, who also wrote articles based upon lies, but Scott had different motivations.  Scott Templeton did not care to influence the world to make it better; he simply craved money and glory.  Sometimes professional storytellers anticipate reality and yet just miss.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not quite correct:
– There was no hexane poisoning
– There was no mangled hand
- There were no guns at the gates when Daisey arrived at the factory.
– There were no bunks stacked to the ceiling.

I certainly agree with you that not every story has two sides (or can be intelligently &quot;polarized&quot;), but if the fact checking had been done, the problems with his narrative would have been caught, and the broadcast would never have happened.

I also think Daisey is a major-league bastard who doesn&#039;t haven&#039;t the decency to feel shame when he lies to millions of people. That puts him a few rungs below James Frey, which isn&#039;t saying a whole lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;First, let them get sick&quot; is partly appropriate modesty. Sometimes a treatment which seems plausible (like hormone replacement) isn&#039;t such a brilliant idea.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, there is something to that. By &lt;em&gt;first, let them get sick&lt;/em&gt; I mean three things: (a) Too little attention paid to fixing small problems, which become larger problems. Small things wrong are ignored until they become big things wrong. Because drugs are so dangerous, they cannot be used on small problems -- the risks outweigh the benefits. An example is gingivitis. I believe it indicates too much inflammation all over your body, not just in your gums. (b) Too little interest in nutrition, which is a major cause of illness. (c) Too little interest in prevention.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I don&#039;t see why you are defending Daisey in your opening here.  

Are you not aware that Apple&#039;s supplier responsibility report began while Steve Jobs was CEO, and that the only things that Daisey added to what they publish turn out to be lies?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t think Daisey&#039;s lies are interesting. He lied to make a better story. He took &quot;dramatic license&quot;. Not the first person to do that -- see David Sedaris, James Frey, and so on. TAL&#039;s failure to catch those lies is more surprising, that&#039;s why I discuss it at length. I think I have more to learn from it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
