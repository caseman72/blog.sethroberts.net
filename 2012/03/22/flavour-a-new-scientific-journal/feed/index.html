		<description><![CDATA[David,

following Seth&#039;s advice I decided to buy myself similar goggles, but was unable to find anything like this within my reach.

So I decided to order custom glasses from an optician&#039;s shop (my eyesight is good, so lenses are not corrective). I chose the biggest frame I could find, but it was small nevertheless.

After getting my glasses I found out that my eyes hurt when I wear them!

I contacted the optician&#039;s and they told me that never did they hear about someone&#039;s eyes hurting when wearing non-corrective lenses.

I don&#039;t know yet what causes this. Probably the frame is too small. I just wanted to warn you that it&#039;s sensible to try the lens for 5-10 minutes before buying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Off topic: Seth, in a video of a lecture you gave, you were wearing orange goggles, presumably because it was after sunset.  Do you have a source for those goggles?
