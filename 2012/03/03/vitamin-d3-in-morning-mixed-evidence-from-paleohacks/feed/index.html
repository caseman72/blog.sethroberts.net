		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always taken my D3 early in the morning. Last fall, I decided to stop eating breakfast because, much like Seth&#039;s experience, my body was waking me up earlier and earlier, usually associated with a growling stomach. Skipping breakfast helped me sleep until 6:30 or 7:00 a.m. on the weekends, which is a significant improvement. Even without breakfast I continued to take my D3 in the morning (8K IU).
Two weeks ago, I tried taking D3 at lunch. I slept through the night but felt as if I hadn&#039;t slept at all when I woke up. It was the worst week of sleep that I can remember. Last week I reversed the experiment, taking D3 in the morning, and my sleep returned to being restful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used to take my D3 at bedtime, with the rest of my vitamins and fishoil.  I was curious whether I&#039;d notice anything with morning timing of D3, so I changed to morning supplements at first light, and as on that same day,  I started yawning around 7:30 pm.  I noticed because I don&#039;t normally yawn, except that yawning is an effect I get from my bedtime melatonin supplement.  So I suspect the switch to morning D3 aids in the body&#039;s changeover to melatonin production.  

I can&#039;t say I notice better sleep, because the dog&#039;s been having a hard time sleeping past 5 am.  But I&#039;m sticking with morning D3 timing because it appears to trigger melatonin production with the end of daylight.  I take 2000 IU D3 on top of  900 IU in multivitamin and calcium pills.]]></description>
