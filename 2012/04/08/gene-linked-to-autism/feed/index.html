		<description><![CDATA[This is a fabulous post, and I whole heartedly support your analysis. [nitpicking] Never the less, I wouldn&#039;t be in the sciences if I didn&#039;t love nit-picking and correct people. While your number of 1 de novo mutation is doubtlessly the right number to use for your analysis, there are about 175 de novo substitutions per diploid genome, and you can&#039;t forget that there are many other classes of mutations. Whole gene duplications and deletions are quite common and likely occur at per base rates comparable to substitutions. Since, of course, the authors were only sequencing the exome, which entails roughly 1% of the human genome, they were only able to identify ~1 
substitution mutation per individual. [/nitpicking] 

I would call their results somewhat suggestive (after all, they did only have 15 nonsense mutations), but certainly the press release and the paper itself oversell their results. I&#039;m not really sure why people are looking for genetic factors when it seems so obvious that an environmental change must be associated with the rise in rates of incidents, since genes simply do not change in frequency that fast without strong selection. Oh well, yet another case of marginal science getting too much press attention.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[for some reason scientist keep banging their heads against the same genetic door. why do they want this to be genetic so badly? There&#039;s no such thing as a genetic epidemic! as a parent with a child who has autism, I find this a frustrating waste of energy, time, and funds. its environmental folks. time to come out of denial. its epigenetics. the toxins/pollutants in the environment are changing the way genes are expressing the cells of the brain during gestation and altering the structure and  developmental trajectory of the brain. the timing, duration, and intensity of exposure during specific critical windows of development dictate the level of damage done and where that individual will fall on the autism &quot; spectrum&quot; and its in us. these toxins are already in us.  so this will be only be getting worse. time to take all those funds and work on trying to isolate the worse toxic offenders and clean up the environment if its not already too late... I&#039;m not hopeful though.]]></description>
