		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

are you aware that there is also a very strong correlation between Pitocin (oxytocin) administration and autism? I think that both make strong case, though no studies have been conducted yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems that it would be very easy to test this in mice.

At least whether prenatal ultrasound radiation affected socialization or ability to learn.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It has been tested in mice. Realistic durations and intensities of ultrasound changed (i.e., damaged) the brains of fetuses. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The study is misleading but not useless.  It is evidence that old intensity ultrasounds don&#039;t cause autism.

It leads to the inevitable question: did the recent surge in autism diagnoses began when old intensity ultrasounds were done or did it wait until modern eight-times intensity?  If the former, there is evidence that ultrasounds are not responsible.  If the latter, there is evidence that they are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, the manner in which &quot;Dr.&quot; Whitehouse responded to your inquiry seems very suspicious to me, suggesting a dishonest answer.  

Maybe I&#039;m being overly cynical, but his comments to you make me suspect serious conflicts of interest on the part of the investigators; probably difficult to prove of course.  Makes me wonder, however, if the journal that published this, or any of the listed investigators, receive $$ from the major manufacturers of ultrasound devices such as GE, Siemans and SonoSite.

BTW, I note his basic background is as a speech pathologist who later acquired a PhD in psychology, according to his profile on the website of his employer, the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research based in Perth, Australia.  Makes me wonder if any of the investigators were MDs.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: My guess is that the article is so misleading because to make clear its shortcomings -- its lack of relevance -- would have made it harder to publish. But that&#039;s just a guess.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
