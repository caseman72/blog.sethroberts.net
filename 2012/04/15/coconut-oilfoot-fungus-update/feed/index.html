		<description><![CDATA[I believe the surest long-term remedy for athlete&#039;s foot is going soapless. Your skin will take on Teflon-like qualities, repeling all manner of infections and rapidly healing when broken. This works not only for athlete&#039;s foot, but also acne, and festering wounds. It&#039;s amazing how little scarring is left if you&#039;re hurt, but take all your baths soapless -- just running warm water over your skin without rubbing, or soaking in a warm bath. Your hair also becomes shiny, smooth and full of body without being greasy. And your pits and bits actually smeller less and better.

Seth: I stopped using soap on my face many years ago. I agree, it&#039;s a good idea. I cut way down on soap on the rest of my body when Richard Nikoley recommended it. I think that&#039;s a good idea, too, but it did not get rid of foot fungus. I didn&#039;t have athlete&#039;s foot. Sometimes going soapless helps with acne, sometimes not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll add another ingredient to this story in that perhaps non-topical application of the Coconut Oil will even required achieve the effect.  I recently (3 weeks) started a Paleo type diet including using Coconut Oil in my cooking, at least once a day for breakfast&#039;s eggs but often 2 or 3 times.  I had developed a fungus like look to one of my big toes over the last two years and it had slowly been spreading, much to my sadness.  As of today, however, all of the new growth on the nail is fungus free.  Completely unexepected results.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also successfully treated toenail fungus with coconut oil.  After getting out of the shower each day, I put a drop of rubbing alcohol on the nail and allowed it to get completely dry, then I massaged in some coconut oil and went about the day as normal.  Within a month, it was nearly gone and after a few more weeks, totally gone.  It works!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I personally use tea tree oil as an anti-fungal agent. As a teen, I frequently had athletes foot infections but never nail fungus. At the first sign of redness, warmth or cracking between toes I now apply tea tree oil. Clears in days. When I travel; hotel showers, gyms and pools are notorious for spreading fungus (tinea pedis) so I preempt the infection by routinely using small amounts of tea tree oil.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: A friend of mine used tea tree oil to get rid of her toenail fungus. I tried it and found it worked for foot fungus but not for toenail fungus -- maybe I wasn&#039;t diligent or careful enough. You write: &quot;As a teen, I frequently had athletes foot infections but never nail fungus.&quot; Why is that, do you think?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of skin problems, I have had a long-standing problem with painful cracks developing on my hands during the colder months of the year.  I&#039;ve tried various remedies, including different skin lotions, A&amp;D ointment, and skin crack sealers (the type that resemble nail polish).  Nothing worked very well, until I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/OKeeffes-Working-Hands-Cream-3-4/dp/B00121UVU0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;O&#039;Keeffe&#039;s Working Hands Cream&lt;/a&gt;.

O&#039;Keeffe&#039;s is truly amazing.  I apply it just once a day, using a generous amount at bedtime (I keep a jar of it in my nightstand).  The cracks are totally eliminated.  I ran out once this winter and didn&#039;t replace it for about ten days, and the cracks returned quickly -- so I&#039;m pretty sure that it works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason I haven&#039;t used the &quot;sock only&quot; method is because I don&#039;t often wear socks (I live in So CA a block from the beach). I&#039;m glad it&#039;s working for you and you found a more convenient application.

I believe I also mentioned to you that a dermatologist told me to soak my foot in a bucket of warm water with a cap-full of household bleach for twenty minutes once every week or two to kill any new fungus. I found this work well along with the coconut oil.

Also, the fungus can survive in your shoes, slippers and even the straps of flip-flops (the non-rubber/plastic kind). So it&#039;s a good idea, once you start treatment to put anti-fungal powder in your shoes - I through out my sleepers and flip-flops (I replace my flip-flops regularly anyway).

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d had athletes foot for years which kept flaring up again and again (as it does), and a couple of years ago I got a cut in my finger and developed what I suspected was a fungal infection. The hand infection was much more distressing for me, and was also intermittently quite painful. My doctor made it clear that she would not test it and use something specific, but rather would prescribe ointments by trial and error, so I gave up on that route.

When I read your post, I started using Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, as sold for cooking,  on both hands and feet. The feet were clear within days, the hands quickly started to improve and are now almost clear.

The oil is solid at room temperature, but liquid at skin temperature, so it&#039;s easy to handle as it&#039;s solid as it comes out of the jar and melts as it is rubbed in. I use a couple of bean sized lumps morning and evening, and I find that I can rub it into the skin so that it&#039;s not oily enough to be an issue - less so than the stuff from the pharmacy, anyway.

Easier and much less unpleasant to handle than the creams and potions I&#039;d used before, leaves me smelling faintly of coconut (which I like but which doesn&#039;t  last for very long), but with one critical difference - so far, it actually works!

I&#039;m very happy - thanks for the pointer!

(BTW, also lost four stone with SLD, so this site has made a huge difference to my life)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Nothing bad happens to the socks, which I think are a cotton/polyester blend.

So this isn&#039;t a very thick layer of coconut oil then?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, a thin layer.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
