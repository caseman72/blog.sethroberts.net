		<description><![CDATA[I found this article:

http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/02/09/surgery.spina.bifada/index.html

Which is possibly what my nurse friend was talking about. It is not a heart defect and they don&#039;t &quot;cure&quot; it, but it seems to help.

The incidence of this disease is about 1 in 3000.

The incidence of autism is though to be about 1 in 110.

If sonography allows us to identify kids with spina bifida early and start treating them, it could prevent parents from choosing to abort the child.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although I&#039;m in medicine, I don&#039;t know much about labor and delivery. A friend who is a nurse said sonograms can help identify children in the womb with heart defects. They sometimes will actually do surgery on the child while it is still inside the mother to repair it, so that when the child is born, he has a healthy heart. I don&#039;t know what heart defect they&#039;re fixing, what the incidence is or what other benefits of sonograms there are, but I&#039;d like to know!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gwern feels skeptical of a link.  Does gwern know of studies that compare the rates in populations with no prenatal ultrasound exposure?

The idea that 1in 300 machines might be running &#039;hot&#039; is disturbing.

The fact that the idea that ultrasound generated bubbles might get hot enough when collapsing to trigger nuclear fusion is even considered is another reason to exercise caution.  Nuclear reactions need 1000000 more energy to trigger vs chemical.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; The girls in the Kaiser-Permanente study who have the highest exposure to ultrasound during the second trimester have more than double the expected rate of autism.

Is this consistent with the claimed 20x increase?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes. The 20x increase happened over a period of time at the beginning of which many fetuses got no exposure. Now no exposure is rare. The Kaiser-Permanente study compared girls with high and low exposure to ultrasound.&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt; what I find important is that the connection has been found repeatedly.

So has crystal healing and sympathetic magic.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I am unaware of even one study showing the efficacy of crystal healing much less repeated studies. Same for sympathetic magic.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
