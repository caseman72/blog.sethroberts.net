		<description><![CDATA[Part of your quote from the Des Spence article,&quot;A quarter of US women are taking mental health drugs,&quot; does not appear to be supported by the actual facts.

I believe it is true that psychiatric drug usage is high and growing, the statement that &quot;over 25% of US women are taking them&quot; overstates the case a great deal.

The source of that assertion apparently traces to the study described here:
http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2012/03/19/womens-use-of-psych-medications-rises-other-health-regimens-lag-men-studies/

Although the study examined records of 2 million patients, those patients were hardly a representative cross-section of the US population.

The study was carried out by Medco, a large mail-order pharmaceutical company which caters to patients covered by prescription drug coverage plans.    The only patient records to which Medco has access are those of its own customers, that is, a pool consistently entirely of people with prescription drug coverage who have actually filled a prescription for a long-term prescription drug of some sort.  

Patients who do not have prescription drug coverage or those who do have it, but who do not use it for long-term medications, will not be in the Medco database.  

So, women who do not take any prescription meds of any sort, or those who take only take the occasional short term course of antibiotics for an acute infection (of the sort they would fill at a local pharmacy rather than through the mail order drug company) were not included in the study.]]></description>
