		<description><![CDATA[Almost everybody has Vertigo, if you get high enough.

It is easy to study construction workers, where they start out not that different than the rest of the population, but end up virtually loosing it, after having worked for months on a scaffold or on a roof. 

I have noticed myself, for instance when I have not worked in a ladder for a long time, that you need some getting used to, before you stop getting Vertigo from looking down. 

So the simple way to treat Vertigo, is just to spend hours in an altitude where you get dizzy looking down, and sooner or later it stops, and then you can go higher. 

That construction workers stop having vertigo is also dangerous, as many die from falling down, after behaving like they were working just a couple of meters above ground, when they in reality are perhaps 10 meters or higher.]]></description>
