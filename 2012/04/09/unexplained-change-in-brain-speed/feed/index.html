		<description><![CDATA[Can you try the same experiment with fish oil (or other omega 3)
Did the butter contain omega 3&#039; ALA, EPA, DHA  (the grass fed contain omega 3)?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;The same experiment&quot;? what do you mean? I don&#039;t know about the omega-3 content of the butter.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve noticed that my performance of tasks involving manual dexterity is best when my normally chilly hands (~75°F) are closer to body temperature. I have seen this effect in my typing and guitar playing, as well as in my times on tests at the website &#039;cognitive fun&#039; (e.g. the reaction time and flanker tests). The effect seems to be the same no matter whether I warm up my hands by exercising, considerably overconsuming calories, or hanging out somewhere hot, and with respect to my typing speed the difference is roughly equal to one standard deviation.

So, hand temperature might be an interesting variable for you to track, at least for a period, if you haven&#039;t done so already.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently running some similar tests.  

I noticed that in the morning my responses are pathetic. 

But tend to improve around noon and peak around 6pm.

I need to find a way to make the tests FASTER so I do them more often.

But it would be nice to get even responses ...]]></description>
