		<description><![CDATA[The ADA isn&#039;t going to like this, but they&#039;re going to lose this fight because of  technology.  The Silicon Valley folks are busy building devices and software so that people can measure their own internal systems.  And the Internet allows for consumers to send that information to a nutritional consultant based somewhere out there on the net, whether that consultant is based in the States or in Thailand.  Technology is going to blow a hole through many a business plan based upon obtaining rent-seeking gatekeeper status.

In the meantime, libertarian-influenced lawyers might successfully fight the rent-seekers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Misleading/inaccurate: you make it sound like they want to be able to sue me for telling my friend that an easy way to cut out hundreds of calories a day is to skip the morning and afternoon mochas.

I see where you&#039;re coming from on this issue, but your post is, as I said, a gross oversimplification.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thank you for clarifying that. I thought it was clear that they want to eliminate competition and that free advice isn&#039;t competition. Competition is other people charging money for nutritional advice.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Make it illegal for anyone they haven’t approved to give nutritional advice&quot; is inaccurate, misleading, and a gross oversimplification of the issue. And yes, I read both the Forbes piece and the PDF to which you linked.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: What was inaccurate or misleading? It&#039;s awfully easy to criticize if you don&#039;t give examples.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
