		<description><![CDATA[a number of things, taken at a sufficient dose, will loosen stool.  Magnesium is one, potassium is another.  as i recall sufficient dose of Vit. C has the same effect, as does epsom salts  probably many supplements]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A bit confusing. The original poster seems to be equating aneurysms with subarachnoid hemmorhages. If the former ruptures, the latter happens. However, it is possible to have the latter from other reasons.

Also, straining because of constipation may cause an aneurysm to burst. It will not cause an aneurysm to form where there wasn&#039;t one before.

So… four separate aneurysms burst? Or one bled four times? Because of straining?

Anyway… she&#039;s very, very lucky to be alive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While well-absorbed forms of magnesium, such as citrate, are better for raising blood and tissue levels, bowel-motility boosting is another distinct project that may work better with less-well-absorbed forms of magnesium, such as oxide.  Because less is absorbed, larger doses can be taken safely, and most of it stays in the gut sucking in water until it is dumped.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;chemo causes constipation, I’m guessing, because it kills intestinal microbes, which fermented foods replace.&quot;

How is this any better than what you complained about other doctors doing.  Why would there be any reason to think that constipation due to chemo is related to intestinal microbes?  Additionally, why wouldn&#039;t you learn about this so you can say why chemo causes constipation and how intestinal microbe death might or might not be related?  I don&#039;t know why you seem so committed to commenting from a position of ignorance.  Not ignorance as in stupid, but ignorance as in a lack of relevant knowledge.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m assuming chemo kills intestinal microbes.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You  sound surprised that head docs don&#039;t look below the navel.  We live in an age of the specialist and medics rarely stand back to get an overview.  

I think we always have to do our own research and take responsibility for fighting our own corner, rather than assuming that busy medics will see connections and act on them.

I can see the constipation-induced blood pressure elevation increasing the rate of bleeding, but there might need to be a vascular injury to begin with.]]></description>
