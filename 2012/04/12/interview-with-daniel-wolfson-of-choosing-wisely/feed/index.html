		<description><![CDATA[I agree that the &quot;evidence&quot; is vague, but at the same time, I just googled &quot;2011 USPSTF screening for coronary heart disease with electrocardiography&quot; and found the USPSTF&#039;s 2004 guidelines (which do not appear to have changed in regards to screening exercise ECG testing). That page is here: http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsacad.htm

And here is the accompanying &quot;summary of evidence&quot;, which looks pretty thorough (though I admit I&#039;ve looked at it for all of 15 seconds)
http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/3rduspstf/chd/chdsum1.htm

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, that&#039;s helpful. I&#039;ve looked at it for more than 15 seconds. Here&#039;s part of what it says: &quot;when the risk for coronary heart disease events is low, most positive findings will be false and may result in unnecessary further testing or worry. The risk level at which the benefits of additional prognostic information outweigh the harms of false-positive results is unclear and requires further study.&quot; I think that it is true for a large fraction of medical tests that &quot;most positive findings will be false and may result in unnecessary further testing or worry&quot;. So why pick these five?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
