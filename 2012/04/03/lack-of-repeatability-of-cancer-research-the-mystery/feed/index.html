		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, great post! 

I think this is a major issue. To address it will require changes in the incentive system that promote collaboration and reproducibility of preclinical academic research. Any new set of incentives should focus, in part, on the funding agencies and journal publications that support academic research. For instance:
- Funding agencies should allocate some proportion of a grant to allow research groups to include independent replication in their project work flow.
- Journal editors should encourage and acknowledge independent replication of key results (either pre or post publication).
&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. I agree with your broad point and I like your specific suggestions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post. This is a very real concern in biomedical research. One valid explanation for why some results don&#039;t replicate is complexity. Under a model of complexity and nonlinearity you don&#039;t necessarily expect some things to replicate. I wrote a paper several years ago showing how and why real genetic association results might not replicate as allele frequencies change slightly from study to study. The paper was published here in PLoS One (open):

		<description><![CDATA[I see the situation only slightly differently than James. I see peer review as reproducing the pre-existing status hierarchy.

When Richard Feynman submits a paper, it is career suicide to reject it. Reviewers are supposed to be anonymous, but in practice cannot rely on that formal reality. If they repeatedly reject papers due to science instead of sociology, they take the risk several times. For example, I keep hearing about reviewer shenanigans, such conflicts of interest, which should be impossible to discover. 

When J random submits a paper, it is career suicide to accept it. 

When J random, Ph.D submits a paper, it is decided based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/18773744/How-to-Publish-a-Scientific-Comment-in-1-2-3-Easy-Steps&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;whether it makes Feynman look bad&lt;/a&gt;. As per the link, if it makes Feynman look bad, the journals will reject it, and get legalistic if J random insists, strenuously pursuing plausible deniability. Feynman will be able to publish multiple replies without difficulty.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not completely correct to believe that experiments are just done once and then blindly believed to be true if in a respectable paper. A proper explanation of research methods and equipment used is standard part in scientific articles, so it&#039;s easy to snatch that and make your own things with it. Hence, results are often reproduced in following studies by various researchers, when experiments are built by using previous research methods as a starting point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that some of the best research is being done by self-taught bloggers like Denise Minger and Paul Jaminet, neither of whom has credentials in nutrition. Almost every professional field has now become a guild that exists primarily to perpetuate itself and not to seek the truth. Education, psychotherapy, literary studies, the arts, and even many of the sciences have become disconnected from the joy of learning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason most drug and disease studies are done is only to support or discredit various products. Proffessional science today is an advertising war -- and has nothing to do with reality. Even government-funded studies are likely corrupted by lobbying efforts. 

Labs are funded with an expected outcome. And are repeated, apparently, until that outcome is achieved, with failures discarded annonmously.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As to what caused the problem:  Peer review caused the problem.  It is career suicide to discover that someone else&#039;s research is irreproducible.

		<description><![CDATA[Wow.  They did it six times and got the result they published once!?  I&#039;m generally a skeptic of medical research, but I still find this amazing.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree. That this sort of thing is perfectly legal -- goes undetected -- is one illustration of the fact that enormously prestigious journals, such as Science and Nature, employ peer reviewers with major gaps in their understanding. It&#039;s like an accounting system with a big hole that allows fraud.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
