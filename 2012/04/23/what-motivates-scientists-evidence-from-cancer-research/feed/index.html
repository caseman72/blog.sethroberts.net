		<description><![CDATA[It will change when Fox News demands gigantic cutbacks in research spending because it&#039;s all based on fraud like this. 

A little drum-banging, some Limbaugh mocking, a Bill O&#039;Reilly rant or two, and the grants will be suspended across the board as the GSA tries to clear its name by launching the biggest fraud investgation in recent memory.

These can&#039;t-be-bothered researchers will start screaming like they&#039;re being burned alive. 

They don&#039;t seem to realize that they are standing on the precipice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; article was really one of the most astounding things I&#039;ve read in recent memory.  Here&#039;s another quote that stood out for me:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Screaming and shouting, it doesn&#039;t do any good. No one takes any notice for reasons I don&#039;t understand,&quot; said John Masters, a professor of experimental pathology at University College London, UCL. &quot;The whole ethos of science is to strive for the truth and produce a balanced argument about the evidence. Yet, all this crap is being produced.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: A curious quote. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s controversial that scientists have motivations other than &quot;truth&quot;. To say &quot;the whole ethos of science is to strive for truth&quot; is to ignore those other motivations: status, job security, attention, community, and so on.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
