		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;The experts decide that Americans get fat by eating fat. Then they find strains of rat that get fat eating fat, then they breed those strains. And now that they have found an animal model that confirms their preconceptions they argue that the preconceptions must be true too – obviously humans get fat on fat because the rats do.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most rats do not get fat eating fat. This was a big reason that Sclafani developed the supermarket diet (consisting of supermarket foods, such as salami and cookies) -- so that rats would get fat more quickly (making it more easy to use them to study obesity). You cannot get a rat fat quickly simply by feeding him a high fat diet, Sclafani told me.]]></description>

&quot;The experts decide that Americans get fat by eating fat. Then they find strains of rat that get fat eating fat, then they breed those strains. And now that they have found an animal model that confirms their preconceptions they argue that the preconceptions must be true too – obviously humans get fat on fat because the rats do. Then some journalist like me comes along, and says, “What about all the other animals that get fat on grains and vegetable matter?” And they look at you and say, “Oh, you’re one of those Atkins people aren’t you?”]]></description>
