		<description><![CDATA[My blood tests earlier this year showed I had low Vitamin D levels and was put on a 50,000IU/week regimen for 3 months using a prescription D2 (ergocalciferol). A recheck then showed my level had hardly changed. A search of PubMed showed conflicting views on using the D2 form. So for the next 3 months I used ProHealth D3 Extreme 50,000IU (via Amazon.com) instead of another D2 scrip my doc had given me. I always took the D2 or D3 in the morning (just lucky happenstance.)

A second recheck after the second 3 mo. showed my vitamin D level as normal. I hand&#039;t put it all together until seeing this post, but when using the D3 I had the same effect of when I got tired, I got *really* tired right at bedtime, and slept like a rock. 

However, even though it has been less than a month since ceasing the weekly dose, I have noticed my sleep degrading somewhat, and lately not even being tired when I should.

I&#039;ll be setting up a maintenance dose regimen (~5,000 IU/day) now!]]></description>

No lie, I have not slept 8 hours or anything, but since I started taking it, I have slept straight through without once waking up to go to the bathroom or just because my brain is so wired.

		<description><![CDATA[Greg,

Chris Masterjohn has written a lot recently on how it is important for D3 to be balanced by adequate A:

blog.cholesterol-and-health.com/2012/01/my-interview-with-carl-lanore-on.html

Very high D3, unbalanced by enough A, may increase likelihood of soft-tissue calcification (kidney stones, etc.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg,
That&#039;s a high dose.  Some people take such doses weekly or bi-weekly, not daily (see the description at the Amazon link you posted.  It has references for further inquiry).  I think many people would recommend that you request a routine 25 hydroxyvitamin D test from your physician to establish your own Vitamin D3 blood levels now, and in a few months.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have had very similar results from first-thing in morning D3.

Differences:
- NOTE: I have great flexibility in my schedule (I can sleep/awake whenever I want), so I have been most focused on &quot;restful&quot; sleeping.
- My pre-D3 issue was restless sleep (waking up frequently), not failure to fall asleep.
- The effect of sleeping all the way through the night was definitely immediate--very first night.
- Also, most days I also wake up feeling more &quot;rejuvinated&quot;. This is not 100% though.
- I take 50,000 IU. (Why? Don&#039;t know...Amazon sells that large of a dose, so I wanted to maximize the effect! I think I calculated this as 75-90 minutes of full-body sunlight equivalent.
- I take D3 at 8a typically. I do not take it any later than 9a, so if I wake up late or forget, I skip that day.

Does anyone have any info about side-effects of taking this much D3? I haven&#039;t observed any, but I&#039;d like to know what to watch for.

$19.99 for a 3 month supply of restful sleep is an amazing bargain!! ;-)


This is the product I use:
