		<description><![CDATA[I have no doubt the tapas were good, but none of those sounded even remotely authentic. Avocado? As typically Spanish as grasshopper.

Spanish food is not really about tapas, but about what Americans would call stews and soups. What a Spaniard would have for lunch, not what he&#039;d have for dinner if he is not at home or in a restaurant]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The real foodies in Japan are in &lt;i&gt;Osaka&lt;/i&gt;. They have a phrase there that goes back to the Edo period: &quot;kui-daore&quot;, literally &quot;eat-fall&quot;, meaning &quot;go bankrupt overeating (extravagantly expensive food)&quot;.

It&#039;s almost impossible to get a bad meal there, in any price range. Aren&#039;t the Italians like that as well?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rashad, I cannot find it online. The name is something like Agalito. If you want to go there, go to the Ikebukuro Station, leave by Exit C6, go in the direction away from the station on the main street until you reach the Seiko building (very close, 2-3 blocks) and then turn left and go about 4 short blocks. You can also follow the directions to the Grand House Chang Tee, which are probably online. It is a few blocks before the hotel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;“I never knew that cheese and tomatoes could go so well together”: I’m baffled. Cheddar and tomato in Britain; Brie and tomato in France; dish after dish in Italy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ve had tomato and mozzarella many times...it is not a good example of the power of the tomato/cheese pairing because the cheese is too weakly-flavored and the tomato is not roasted. Neither is at their best. It&#039;s not enough to put the two together. You have to optimize the combination -- choose the best cheese, the best tomato, and the best proportions.]]></description>
