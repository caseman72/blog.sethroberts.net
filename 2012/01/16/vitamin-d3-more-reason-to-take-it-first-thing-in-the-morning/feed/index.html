		<description><![CDATA[Re: multivitamins.

Yes, but if the timing is important, when do you take the multivitamin?

I take Vit-D in the morning and magnesium at night. but my multivitamin has both what to do then?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too discovered independently that D3 first thing in the morning works. I have also found that the best time of day for 5HTp, if you need that, is about 40 minutes before bed. And by the way, if you wake up stiff- thinking you are getting old, try the 5HTp. Muscles need serotonin too, and stiffness will show up before depression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vitamin K2 is another co-factor, with a role in bone and arterial health.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K#Vitamin_K_and_bone_health

Apparently D3, A, and K2 are all needed to carboxylate osteocalcin, and osteocalcin is what keeps calcium in the bones and out of the arteries.  (When it&#039;s undercarboxylated, osteocalcin can&#039;t &#039;hook&#039; the calcium molecules, so they aggregate in the circulatory system, and show up on calcium scans.)

Many people don&#039;t get enough of D3, A, or K2.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Taking vit D early in the morning has been a game changer for me. I take it first thing after getting out of bed. I take 15k IU.

I started doing this after reading the suggestion on your blog. I&#039;d been taking it for years at different times of the day but never early in the morning. It hasn&#039;t helped my sleep but the upgrade in mood and energy has been staggering. 

I started taking vit K and CLO (for the A) along with the D and the affect diminished. I dropped the K and CLO and it came back.

I wish I had thought to try this years ago. Thanks for passing the tip along.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Which co-factors does Vitamin D3 require? I googled around for it but all I could find were discussions about keeping a (roughly) 2:1 ratio between vitamins A &amp; D (e.g. 10k IU of Vitamin A needs 5k IU of Vitamin D3 to balance).]]></description>
