		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I’m sure you would agree that not all the studies in the literature stand equally. Therefore doctors and scientists must choose which studies to believe. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree with your first statement (not all studies equal). However, your second sentence (&quot;therefore doctors...&quot;) doesn&#039;t follow from it. Instead of &quot;choosing what studies to believe&quot; doctors and scientists can assign each study a degree of belief. And consider all of them. Not ignore any of them.

In my experience this is what scientists usually do. Only doctors and evidence-based medicine advocates and the like promote black-and-white all-or-nothing thinking about evidence. Bayesian statistics is a formalization of what most scientists do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In response to the above question number two.

I&#039;m sure you would agree that not all the studies in the literature stand equally. Therefore doctors and scientists must choose which studies to believe. For this they need to have a consistent system to help separate the good from the bad. This system is always evolving and getting better.

Some of the principles that have come out of this system are:
human studies are more relavent than animal studies.
Large studies outweigh small studies.
Blinded studies outweigh non blinded studies.
Double blinded studies outweigh blinded studies.
Effects with explainable mechanisms outweigh effects with unexplained mechanisms when dealing with small effect sizes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Let’s assume results from Organism X (carrots, perhaps) tell us exactly nothing about what will happen when humans get the same treatment. What’s your plausible alternative to the zero DNA overlap explanation?
Simple: Carrots and humans have an extremely different physiology, despite sharing a large percentage of DNA. Therefore, the fact that putting carrots in compost makes the grow faster tells us virtually nothing about whether putting humans in compost will achieve the same thing.

Now let me ask you the question straight out:

1) Do you think that my &quot;carrot study&quot; is evidence that putting humans in compost would make them grow?

2) If yes, how much evidence? Enough evidence that a family doctor should use it when suggesting a course of treatment for a child?&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last year I put a lot of compost in the ground and my carrots grew much bigger than they had before.

By your argument, since humans share a great deal of DNA with carrots (about 20%), this is evidence that putting a human in compost will cause them to grow bigger.

Suppose someone suggested that this was not evidence at all. We could then just copy-and-paste your argument:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let’s assume it’s true that the [carrot] results tell us nothing about what will happen with humans. Can you think of another plausible explanation for this pattern of results besides zero DNA overlap?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now this argument is clearly absurd. There are hundreds of plausible explanations for why this carrot result is not evidence for the conclusion, and it is a strawman to say that the only possibility would be if there were &quot;zero DNA overlap&quot; between carrots and humans.

On the other hand, if you do actually believe that my &quot;carrot study&quot; above *is* evidence that putting a human in compost will cause them to grow bigger, then you are using such a definition of &quot;evidence&quot; that is so useless to research as to be virtually meaningless, and, in any case, this is not the kind of &quot;evidence&quot; that a doctor should rely on when prescribing medicine.]]></description>

That&#039;s why rat studies help us predict what will happen when a similar experiment is done in humans.

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, thanks for your final question (&quot;Is questioning standard surgical practices a good thing?&quot;). What I am really questioning is how evidence-based medicine is done. They omit a lot of evidence. Often the omitted evidence is much more negative than positive. This leads to a huge positive bias in what outside observers see -- the treatment under review appears much better than it actually is. Yet the possibility of such a bias is never mentioned. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Such a long and an interesting conversation...that seems to be winding down. I had my tonsils removed forty years ago and can stil see the video in my mind&#039;s eye of my tearful plea to my father:&quot;Don&#039;t let them take me away!&quot;. I remember that the promised course of post-surgery therapeutic doses of ice cream did not materialize as soon as expected. With what I know now ( I utilize alternative and nutritional therapies more so than pharmaceutical and surgical ones), I may have kept my tonsils a bit longer.

In arguments, it is easy to keep gnawing at one tree. Gorski responded to Robert&#039;s challenge of the widespread practice of tonsillectomy by suggesting that laymen does not always know how to interpret and prioritize the data. Roberts has taken the bait regarding this minor question of mice and men and evidence and the trap has snapped shut. I must give points to the doctors on this one, but wish Gorski would respond to the spirit of Robert&#039;s original blog: Is questioning standard surgical practices a good thing?]]></description>
