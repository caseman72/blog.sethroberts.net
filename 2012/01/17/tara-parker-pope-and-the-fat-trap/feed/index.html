		<description><![CDATA[Yes, but as you correctly note, the difference is primarily psychological, not physiological. 

In a society like ours saturated with messages to eat more, going *cold turkey* (slim-fast drink) might be an effective way to purge oneself of the psychological addiction to food, at least in the short term. But I dont for a moment believe that such a radical solution is necessary. French women, and Thais and Japanese, all eat deliciously, yet little, and do not suffer greatly.

It took me some time to get over my addiction to food - even to recognize that I had an addiction to food that was psychological and cultural in origin - and I did suffer when I ate less, but over time, the suffering vanished. Today I can eat tiny amounts and feel quite good.

The key is to remove all the stumbling blocks preventing you from recognizing that the suffering is psychological not physical.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;There is only calories in calories out. If you eat 300 calories of chocolate muffin or 300 calories of veggies you gain the exact same amount of fat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In two studies published in the 1970s, Michel Cabanac and his colleagues found that two different ways of eating the same number of calories per day (about 2000) produced very different results. They produced the same weight loss, but different psychological effects. One way (eating the same foods, but less of them) produced considerable hunger and suffering. The other way (switching to a SlimFast-like drink) produced no hunger and little suffering (the main suffering was boredom).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;certain vegetables, even — which everybody agrees are great weight-loss foods — that others can eat with impunity create havoc with my metabolism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More culprits here. &lt;i&gt;There is no such thing as a great weight loss food&lt;/i&gt;. There is only calories in calories out. If you eat 300 calories of chocolate muffin or 300 calories of veggies you &lt;i&gt;gain the exact same amount of fat&lt;/i&gt;.

Second culprit - &lt;i&gt; your metabolism is not special&lt;/i&gt;. They have done studies on *naturally* thin people who supposedly can eat whatever they want and have discovered that they are &lt;i&gt;eat less without even being aware of it&lt;/i&gt;. Conversely, fat people &lt;i&gt;underreport&lt;/i&gt; what they eat while not being aware of it. When YOU see these thing people eat socially they just ate 3 gigantic slices of pizza - what you DONT see is how little they ate at home. Perhaps they eat nothing the rest of the day.

I lived with no less than 3 very thin people in my life and had occasion to observe first hand how they remained thin - they were all convinced they could eat whatever they wanted and just had fast metabolisms. It was nonsense. They simply ate almost nothing without being aware that this was not how other people ate.

This was another eye opener in my path to thinner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tess, weight loss was NOT EASY for me (at first) nor for ANY MALE that I know. It was an incredible STRUGGLE and for you to simply dismiss my dedication and effort as *easy* is incredibly rude. It sounds like you are simply making excuses for why YOU are not losing weight. When people start complaining that weight loss is *easy* for some but not for *them*  (because of gender, or *my metabolism is just slow*, lol) they are simply making excuses. Trust me, I used to do the SAME THING all the time before I got thin! It was a major mental block I had to overcome. The truth is, the INITIAL stages of fat loss (first 6 months at least) are easy for NO ONE. Not you. Not me. THINGS ARE NOT ESPECIALLY HARD JUST FOR YOU. Get over the self-pity.

You may THINK you are eating *low calorie*, but if you are not losing weight then you are not eating LOW ENOUGH. You are either cheating in ways you are not aware of (a little cookie here or there), or just dont really understand how little you have to eat. It might shock you learn how little you actually have to eat, but it is the truth. This is the mental block we all have to overcome to lose weight. There is NO such thing as a weight loss plateau (how do you think people starve to death? Why dont they just plateau lol? They have done studies on Army rangers where they put them in massive caloric deficits for a few months and they just kept on losing to incredible levels. No plateaus). If you *plateaued*, you have to eat even LESS. I once bought into plateauing also - I *fixed* it by just adjusting my calories down. There IS such a thing as a weight loss slow down because as you lose fat the body has less fat available to burn, but there is no such thing as a total stall IF you are eating less calories than you burn. Its simple science.

Two things might suggest the culprit here 

1) Exercise will not help you lose weight. You burn a tiny amount and then frequently compensate by either reducing activity the rest of the day through exhaustion (thus burning the same amount total, making the exercise pointless), or overeating out of hunger. 

2) You are still messing around with nonsense like PALEO, which suggests you have not fully internalized the message that you simply have to EAT LESS.]]></description>

YES, it is EASY for my husband to lose weight.

		<description><![CDATA[No one said it was easy, tess, just that it is simple and we know exactly how to do it. Simply eat less. There is no mystery. Everyone pretends that there is this incredible mystery in how to lose weight - ironically, it is precisely this belief that might be preventing people from coming to terms with the reality of what needs to be done. Instead they waste time on fad diets like low-carb which promise you you can still eat lots and lose weight. Most people are shocked when they discover how few calories the body really needs to maintain itself and how few we have to eat to lose weight. For instance, we have this idea that a *healthy* calorie intake per day is around 2000 for men. Even a very large man over six feet needs much less than that! Most people today would believe they are eating *unhealthy* and be in *starvation mode* if they ate the number of calories they really needed to lose weight and be healthy.

It was living in Japan and Thailand that helped open my eyes to this truth. The good news is that this idea that you have to eat this ridiculous amounts to be healthy is just something programmed into us by our deficient culture, and we CAN de-program ourselves.

The fact of the matter is that the initial stages of weight loss can be quite difficult as you learn to de-program yourself from all the messages that you will *feel miserable* on anything less than 1800 calories per day (for a man) - its complete nonsense - and that you need to eat 5 times a day and always eat MORE bla blah.

Yes, it can be difficult. But it is simple. And we know how to do it. There is no mystery.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i find it interesting that it&#039;s men in this comment section who claim that losing weight is easy....  for men, it DOES seem to be easy -- my husband is the same.

women find it much harder to lose weight, especially as they progress into midlife.  a lifetime of trying to be thin is a handicap, which limits our progress with every new attempt.  add to this other hormonal changes which skew the body toward wanting to store more fat.  for those women who are also getting bad advice about ideal diet, i imagine it seems impossible.

i&#039;m incorporating Seth&#039;s (thank you!) SLD tweak to my strict paleo regimen (i was 80-20 before); the first week, weight POURED off me.  the second week, with no change in menu, the loss was not consistent -- some days my weight was up.  i&#039;m into my third week now, and far less hopeful of reaching my goal any time soon (WON&#039;T be moving to Step 2 at the 30-day mark)....  btw, i&#039;m only moderately overweight -- less than 28 bmi.

so, YEAH -- it IS hard to lose weight as well as to keep it off -- if you&#039;re a woman.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I just read an interesting little article from the Association for Psychological Science, with the title:
 To “Think Outside the Box”, Think Outside the Box.

It studied whether people were more creative when they literally were physically inside or outside a large box. According to the article, people really were more creative when situated physically outside a box.

I don&#039;t have much room in my apartment for big boxes, but I&#039;m trying a variation of this, using two very small boxes, one on my desk, and one in my refrigerator. The idea is that every time I get a food craving, I will see a box, and maybe, just maybe, it will get me to &quot;think outside the box&quot; and find a healthier way to satisfy the craving.

Silly idea, maybe, but isn&#039;t it in the spirit of self-experimentation?

The article:
http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/to-think-outside-the-box-think-outside-the-box.html

My blog comment about it:

<p>I don&#8217;t have much room in my apartment for big boxes, but I&#8217;m trying a variation of this, using two very small boxes, one on my desk, and one in my refrigerator. The idea is that every time I get a food craving, I will see a box, and maybe, just maybe, it will get me to &#8220;think outside the box&#8221; and find a healthier way to satisfy the craving.</p>
<p>Silly idea, maybe, but isn&#8217;t it in the spirit of self-experimentation?</p>

If you lose weight WITHOUT lowering your set point, I think this is when you see all the changes you mention.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, on re-setting set points, your articles speak of it differently than Pope&#039;s sources:

Scientists are still learning why a weight-reduced body behaves so differently from a similar-size body that has not dieted. Muscle biopsies taken before, during and after weight loss show that once a person drops weight, their muscle fibers undergo a transformation, making them more like highly efficient “slow twitch” muscle fibers. A result is that after losing weight, your muscles burn 20 to 25 percent fewer calories during everyday activity and moderate aerobic exercise than those of a person who is naturally at the same weight. That means a dieter who thinks she is burning 200 calories during a brisk half-hour walk is probably using closer to 150 to 160 calories. 

....

A full year after significant weight loss, these men and women remained in what could be described as a biologically altered state. Their still-plump bodies were acting as if they were starving and were working overtime to regain the pounds they lost.
________ 

Pope is saying that there is something about getting fat itself that makes makes it harder for a person to be thin.  That&#039;s the &#039;re-set&#039; that I&#039;m talking about, and it&#039;s very different from your concept.

If that&#039;s at all true, then imagine how much more important the cultural argument is.  The best way to be thin is never to get fat?]]></description>

n=1
In 1968 I was doing my honours year in a science faculty in australia. On saturdays, i was one of the very few doing their project in the labs  , others were at the football match or getting ready for parties. At 1230pm I was hungry and there was only one lunch place open within 3miles, a greek hamburger joint, ONE!  We were all a thin cohort then, except for the exception. 

Today in 2012, temptation to the brain through the eyes is everywhere through the explosion in coffee shops, food shops etc, and I can feel the brain assessing and visualising food images as i walk to the train, walking the dog, etc, past the multitude of temptations , its everywhere. The reverse to 1968 is now apparent to me as a time evolution  experiment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;That’s an interesting idea. In addition to the obesity epidemic, where else can we see evidence for this?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seth, I spent a lot of time on business in Thailand and Japan, where the people are incredibly thin and eat tons of carbs and sugars, etc. After a while you grasp that the people are not thin *effortlessly*. There are strong traditions governing how much to eat and what you eat (traditions we have lost), and there is a MASSIVE social stigma to being fat. It just is not acceptable. There was an article a while ago in the NYT about how Japanese women obsessively watch what they eat in order to stay incredibly thin. Portions are much smaller too, which studies have shown play a role in feeling full.

To me, this is some amount of evidence in support of the idea that cultural factors are the culprits here. 

Also, if EVERYONE is eating much less and it is just part of the tradition governing food consumption, it really IS much easer, but it is not *effortless* in the sense that no self-discipline is involved and one can just eat impulsively.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt; disagree. She should not blame herself for not knowing how to stay thin — hardly anyone knows. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is completely false. Everyone knows how to lose weight. Eat less. It just takes discipline so no one wants to do it. Before I accepted this simple truth - that it does not matter what I eat, provided I eat less of it - I was struggling with diets (paleo, low carb, you name it) and was chronically fat. Simply accepting the disagreeable and unwelcome truth that I need to eat LESS (in my mind, it meant less pleasure in my life. As it turned out, that was a flawed belief. I actually began to enjoy my meals much more) finally liberated me to lose weight and I went from 200 lbs to 155 lbs and have stayed there for 5 years so far. All I do is eat less, but I eat anything I want (sugar, desserts, fat, meat, pasta - anything)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Something about the environment — something that controls weight — has changed. Not exercise. Thirty years ago, Americans probably exercised less than now. It is likely that something they ate kept them thin, without trying.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While you are right that this has to be caused by environmental changes, you make 2 logical mistakes 1) The changes can easily be CULTURAL and not in what we ate  (as in loss of self-discipline, loss of a willingness to put up with deprivation, marketing that encourages us to always want MORE of everything, including food) 2) It does not follow that people were *effortlessly* thin in the 70s. It is quite possible that people were simply willing to put up with more deprivation and self-discipline was valued.

Heck, even a cultural force like fat shaming can be the catalyst for change. I know you say that there is fat shaming in todays culture, but it is not really serious.]]></description>
