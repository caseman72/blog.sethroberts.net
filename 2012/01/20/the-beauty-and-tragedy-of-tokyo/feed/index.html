		<description><![CDATA[Right. Diversity wont surely cause dirty public bathrooms because in a more diverse society there wouldn&#039;t be pristine public bathrooms to sully in the first place. 

Neither would there be much beauty without order, unity, and peace. There are sociological preconditions to the beauty and unique culture of Japan. A high level of trust is one of them. And high levels of trust and other forms of social capital are inversely correlated with diversity.]]></description>

Right. More black people! More chicanos! Invite the world!  That&#039;s exactly what Japan needs...

		<description><![CDATA[Deidre, pretty good article!

There’s a long-running Japanese manga series (started in 1983) called Oishinbo, which has also become an animated series, a movie, and even a game.  It’s all about a group of food reporters who visit restaurants and have various food and cooking-related adventures. Remember, this is a &lt;i&gt;cartoon&lt;/i&gt;.

During the New Year holiday I caught a rerun of the animated series on TV, and the storyline was about a bartender and his little bar in Shinjuku. One of the reporters said this bar had the best on-the-rocks whiskey in town, so they all went there, drank some, and agreed it was tops. 

But the owner was sad because he had to close the bar soon. Why? Because the rural company that made his ice was going out of business, and without that special ice, made from the water coming from a particular well, he couldn’t make the best on-the-rocks ever. So the plot was how the gang went off to the country and solved his problem by securing his ice supply!

The whole story was presented as a &lt;i&gt;crisis of conscience&lt;/i&gt; for the bar owner. If he couldn’t make it just so, he wouldn’t make it all – he refused to break faith with his customers. Just another indicator of the level of obsession they bring to food here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really? I found Tokyo the prototypical ugly industrial city utterly lacking in any kind of charm whatsoever. Its a typical Asian *shambles* city (everything is thrown together higgledy piggledy without any regard for aesthetics or beautiful architecture) . Many of your points refer to convenience and not beauty. For me, a really characterful city would be Amsterdam, London, Paris, Rome - now THAT is beautiful. New York and Boston are much more beautiful than Tokyo also.

Whats *beautiful* about Tokyo is not the setting, which is ugly, but the human element - not in the sense that they are especially beautiful per se, but rather because they all make an effort to be wonderfully thin and fit looking and dress exquisitely and often even picturesquely. The human element represents the true *beauty* of Tokyo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Excellent map and direction signage. In subways, for example, way-finding signs tell the distance, not just the direction, of the destination. This is so basic (distance and direction are orthogonal) yet other places, such as New York, don’t do it. Such creative attention to detail, such improvement on something so old (wayfinding signs) isn’t just helpful, it’s inspiring. I came across a construction site sign that appeared to say how loud the work would be. Again, serious improvement on tradition.

I recently binged through 4 of Edward Tufte&#039;s books, and I couldn&#039;t help but notice how many of his graphics examples were Japanese. I couldn&#039;t help but wonder if there was some connection to kaizen and artisanal pride and lifetime employment.]]></description>
