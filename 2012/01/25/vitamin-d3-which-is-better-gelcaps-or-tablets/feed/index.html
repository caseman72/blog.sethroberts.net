		<description><![CDATA[Thanks.  This is very interesting.

I have run across one other person talking about a sleep-vitamin D connection:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/d-sleep&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. Stasha Gominak who has a YouTube video up on this topic&lt;/a&gt;.  She found that her patient&#039;s sleep got better when they were supplementing D3 and got their 25(OH)D3 blood levels up into a certain range (I think it was 50-80 ng/ml).  She claimed that she&#039;d seen sleep quality get worse again when that range got overshot (~90 ng/ml or over).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of years ago, in the winter, I was taking 4000 IU vit D in tablets daily. A blood test showed that My levels were at the top end of what my doctor considered safe, nearing toxicity levels. Therefore, in my case, the tablets were effective at increasing my vit D levels. I always take them with a meal, so perhaps I ingest enough fat along with the tablets.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that I&#039;ve mentioned here before that the cardiologist Dr. William Davis has discussed this multiple times on his blog.  He tests the blood Vitamin D level of all his patients, and has found with many patients that Vitamin D tablets often barely budge their serum levels.  After a lot of bad experiences, he started insisting that all his patients take D in gelcaps or oil drops.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cardiologist Dr William Davis (http://www.trackyourplaque.com/blog/) treats all his patient with Vitamin D. The end goal of his vitamin D treatment is to raise individuals vitamin D blood level to 60 - 80 NG/ML. He has found that using anything OTHER than gelcaps does not work to raise his patient&#039;s vitamin D levels

 Although in your case you may be digesting oil near enough to taking the tablet D3 to metabolize it properly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Why are you so interested in further improvements to your sleep ability (this Vitamin D discovery)?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am interested in this discovery for several reasons: 1. It is surprising. Vitamin D has been heavily studied but this has been missed. 2. It is practical. Lots of people have sleep problems. 3. I was involved in the discovery. 4. My sleep has room for improvement. 5. Maybe I can take Vitamin D3 in place of one-legged standing. That would be much easier.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are other reasons to consume Vitamin D, including the health of your teeth.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/AtTexU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. Guyenet&#039;s article here&lt;/a&gt;.  Specifically see this picture: 
 ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/xvSXJ1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; here&#039;s a link to the picture if gt; img lt; tags are not allowed&lt;/a&gt;).  Basically, vitamin D drastically reduces cavities and my wife is anecdotal evidence.  She used to have at least one cavity *every* time she went to the dentist , and after I put her on 2,000 I.U. of vitamin D per day, her last two visits to the dentist have been cavity free.
