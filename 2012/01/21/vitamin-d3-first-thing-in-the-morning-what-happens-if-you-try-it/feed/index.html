		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always been a night owl who found it difficult to get going in the morning. I was also someone who really didn&#039;t like breakfast. After going through your blog I started taking vitamin d3 tablets as soon as I woke up in the morning and found they certainly made a difference to my energy level. About 2 hours after ingesting the d3, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head and I suddenly felt energetic. I don&#039;t know if I my sleep was any deeper but I did wake up earlier and feeling somewhat alert. I then started eating breakfast (normally something small and light) and found this made a significant difference in how early I woke up. 

After three weeks of combining the two I went from an average wake up time without alarm clock of 8am to an average wake up time without alarm clock of 6am. This is regardless of the time I went to bed the night before. I also find that I am alert and energetic as soon as I wake up. Before the combined D3/breakfast routine it took me about an hour before I felt completely alert and energetic. Although I still have to force myself to eat first thing in the morning, the benefits for me are worth it. Hopefully the longer I do this, the more it will feel natural, rather than a bit of a chore.

Thank you so much for your blog, it&#039;s one of my favourite internet indulgences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot, Tom! I will look into K2 Mk4. Apparently it isn&#039;t easy to get it in supplement form in Russia (much like pastured dairy).

I thought about eating liver for K2, but I live in a highly industrial area, so I&#039;m afraid it can contain mercury and lead.

What do you think is the right proportion of K2 to D3?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[K2 from fermentation is the Mark 7 form, not the animal form.  I hadn&#039;t heard that sauerkraut was a source; K2 Mk7 typically comes from natto (a fermented Japanese delicacy.)

Most of what I&#039;ve read is that the better form for humans is the Mk4 type. (Pastured dairy is a good source of Mk4.)  Both are available in supplement form.  I actually take both, along with cod liver oil (for A) and D3.

When I take all three my teeth feel slippery for several days.  When you have adequate D3/A/K2, the calcium phosphate in the tartar on your teeth is actually being taken up (rather than deposited) by your saliva, so they feel as if they&#039;ve just been cleaned.

It&#039;s very cool.  And I like to think that something similar is happening to the calcium in my arteries.

		<description><![CDATA[Tom,

I eat sauerkraut as suggested by Tim Ferris:

&quot;It has also been hypothesized that vitamin D toxicity is often a result of vitamin K deficiency. If you choose to supplement with vitamins A and D, as I do with cod liver oil and liquid vitamin D, it is important to ensure adequate K(2). Suggested sources include butter from grass- fed cows and the aforementioned lacto-fermented foods.&quot;

But I didn&#039;t, in fact, checked his suggestion for validity yet (which might be really dumb).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I started taking D3 first thing in the morning yesterday.
I drink 1.5 T cod liver oil and immediately after that 4500 IU of D3 concentrate with a plate of sauerkraut.

Prior to that I took 2000 IU of D3 in the morning and 2000 IU before bed for three weeks.

I&#039;ll take D3 for another three weeks, then try to plot different things I measured (mood, bedtime and waketime, efficiency tracked via your R percentile feedback script).

I also drink a cup of kefir with chelated magnesium right before bedtime.]]></description>
