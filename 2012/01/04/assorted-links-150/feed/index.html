		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth here is a Crohn&#039;s infographic: http://curetogether.com/blog/2011/09/20/crohns-study-results-29-treatments-rated-by-patients/

Showing more evidence that trying a side-effect free change, specific carbohydrate diet, in this case is as effective as most conventional pharmaceutical and surgery options.  Which all come with public known side effects.  

One would could also deduce that if you coupled several of the safe natural treatments on that list, for instance SCD diet, fish oil, probiotics, vitamin D, and stress reduction you could easily have a recipe for complete remission of Crohn&#039;s disease.   The success stories in my inbox from people using strategies like the one above AFTER failing with conventional drugs is astounding!]]></description>

&quot;The obstacle to finding the mole is the intelligence service itself, which attempts to rid itself of the mole hunter. It doesn&#039;t want to admit that it has been gulled—a story that&#039;s all too rooted in reality. &quot;]]></description>
