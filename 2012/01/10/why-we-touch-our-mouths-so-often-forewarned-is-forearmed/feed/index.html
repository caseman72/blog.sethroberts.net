		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;So exposure to lots of germs is good for our immune system?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lots of germs &lt;strong&gt;in small amounts&lt;/strong&gt; is good. You want your first exposure to Germ X to be a small amount, not a large amount. If it is a small amount, you will survive later exposures to large amounts of the same germ. If your first exposure is to a large amount of Germ X, well, good luck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you said:
&quot;I propose an evolutionary explanation:  To expose our immune system to all the germs near us in small amounts.&quot;

So exposure to lots of germs is good for our immune system?

In recent years, each time that I have been in a hospital it takes them about 2 days to give me a staph infection, 2 more days to give me MRSA, and another 2 days to give me VRE. 

If being exposed to germs is good, then I must be getting very healthy from all these hospital-acquired infections.

But maybe I could get the immunity-conferring benefits without the inconvenience of a hospital stay: Maybe I could just sit in a hospital ER waiting room for an hour a day, and get acquainted with lots of germs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d always enjoyed mixed nuts but at about age 60 they started upsetting my stomach.  I stumbled across the explanation in Jim Watson&#039;s book on DNA - he alluded to an allergy to the protein in Brazil nuts.  Now if I stick to almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts, all is well.  One Brazil seems to do little or no harm - a handful is bad news.  To my surprise, when I checked the wikipedia page on Brazils no mention was made of the problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Much more plausible explanations:

1. the mouth region, for obvious reasons, is one of the most sensitive and nerve-dense regions; face-touching is about dealing with itches and transient discomfort, in the same way people knead their fingers or scratch their hands or what not. (Look around, how many people are doing fiddling with their fingers in some way? I thought so.)
2. Body language; the face in general is a major source of cues about one&#039;s state. One&#039;s hands can hide the face. Such obscuration is very useful in public.
3. The head is fairly heavy and modern people do not get much exercise. It&#039;s simply about resting the neck muscles.

Germs... I would be quite surprised if that turned out to be the explanation. Well, at least it&#039;s testable (manipulate immune systems with immunosuppressants, etc).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Scott -- part of the problem is that food allergies seem to be &quot;trendy&quot; now.  Many people who &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; they&#039;re allergic to foods are really not allergic to them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
J Psychosom Res. 1999 Dec;47(6):545-54.

Psychological characteristics of people with perceived food intolerance in a community sample.

Knibb RC, Armstrong A, Booth DA, Platts RG, Booth IW, MacDonald A.
School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, UK. rebecca.knibb@nottingham.ac.uk

Abstract
In most adults who believe themselves to be food intolerant there is no objective supporting evidence. It has therefore been proposed that the misperception of intolerance to food is linked to psychiatric illness or personality disorder. This hypothesis was tested in a community-derived sample of individuals who attributed an adverse symptom to a type of food. A random mailing recruited 955 participants aged &gt; or =18 years, of whom 232 perceived themselves to be food intolerant (PFI). All recruits were sent two questionnaires, the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) and the shortened version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R). A total of 535 GHQ-28 and 518 EPQ-R forms were returned that were correctly completed, an overall response rate of 55%. For the subscales of the EPQ-R, neuroticism was greater in those with a PFI than those without. Women with a PFI were more extroverted than control women. For the GHQ-28 subscales, women with a PFI had significantly higher scores than control women on somatic symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, and severe depression. There was a greater percentage of psychiatric caseness among women with a PFI than among men with a PFI or control women. Nevertheless, this percentage was no greater than that reported among a reference sample derived from NHS and university staff. It is concluded that perceived food intolerance is associated with psychological distress in women with a PFI, and neurotic symptoms in both men and women with a PFI, but there is no greater prevalence of psychiatric disorder among women or men with a PFI than there is in some professional groups.
