		<description><![CDATA[I see words as a representation.  As what they represent gets more complex, so do the patterns used to create them.  I think the most pure form of communication is sharing an experience.  However even that experience is limited by a person&#039;s perception.  I often lose perspective on what communication really is, its an abstract, not the reality of the moment.  It intrigues me as to how much is perceived without words.  This would reason to place great emphasis on health and awareness to maximize perception and cognition.  To better understand and communicate with one another to get what we want and also redefine what we want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The use of single words began and grew because they helped the two sides of trade find each other.&quot; 

But surely the necessity for sounds that provided warning of threat from predators (and other danger) preceded words for trade? And perhaps vocalizations that encouraged silence in the presence of predators. Before we could trade we had to be able to survive...

And the need to communicate specificity of edible plant locations might have encouraged enough fine-grained cognition so that words developed -- think of the bee waggling behavior that locates pollen. 

I&#039;m not saying your theory is wrong, but parts of it are perhaps over-stated.]]></description>
