		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;The program interviewed doctors from the Auckland hospital and none of them had tried it, they just kept repeating ‘there is no science behind it’ and that they wouldn’t use it even when asked because it ‘would give the family false hope’.

That last statement I found… astounding. You have a terminal patient, the family has NO hope left and you are scared to try what they ask in case it gives them some??&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree. And I would also say: How do these doctors know the hope is &quot;false&quot;? If the idea is untested, as they say, why are they sure it is wrong? That makes no sense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I live very close to an &#039;integrative&#039; medical centre (medical doctors that also practice so-called &#039;fringe&#039; medicine, like intravenous vit C). One of these doctors was the subject of a documentary here because she came out and claimed that intravenous vitamin C can save lives in cases of viral infection. She presented a case of a man that was literally hours from death from the Swine Flu and recovered after his family paid privately for her to administer intravenous vit C. They did this against the advice of the doctors that were watching him die.

The program interviewed doctors from the Auckland hospital and none of them had tried it, they just kept repeating &#039;there is no science behind it&#039; and that they wouldn&#039;t use it even when asked because it &#039;would give the family false hope&#039;. 

That last statement I found... astounding. You have a terminal patient, the family has NO hope left and you are scared to try what they ask in case it gives them some?? There is no logic. So, the patient dies and the family is left forever wondering what would have happened if they &#039;had&#039; tried it.  People should be allowed, encouraged to try anything they think will help them. In the case of terminal illness, even a bit of placebo effect might be a good thing (as a Psych., I&#039;m sure you know that placebo effect is sometimes biochemically measurable). 

It makes me annoyed when I read about doctors beating down self-experimentation. Oh, and that&#039;s on top of the way that environmental contamination already makes my blood boil. ..]]></description>
