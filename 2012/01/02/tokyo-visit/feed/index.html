		<description><![CDATA[Hope you&#039;re enjoying your trip. On Monday you might get a chance to refine your theories on evolution by being near a city hall or shrine that&#039;s doing a &#039;Coming of Age&#039; day ceremony. You&#039;ll see lots of 20 year olds dressed in kimonos and then getting drunk around the city. 

It&#039;s been amazing to me how differently Chinese, Japanese and Korean cultures evolved quite differently while keeping some commonalities.]]></description>

I also found an article about a miso specialty shop that looked interesting. You can find the article by Googling &quot;miso food for the samurai&quot; (include the quotes).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Going to the Tsukiji fish market early in the morning, seeing the goings-on, and then getting sushi is a lot of fun. You want to eat somewhere with a long line.

The big department stores have huge food markets in the basements with prepared foods as well as pickles, etc., go there to sample the foods. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have done both those things in the past and really enjoyed them. For me one of the highlights of a trip to Tokyo has been smelling the many kinds of miso available for sale (in a department store food court) and buying some really good miso to take home.]]></description>

If you want to see temples, the best thing is to take a day trip to Kamakura, but that&#039;s really a full day trip.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Damn, missing you by 1 day Seth!

Have been reading your blog for months from Tokyo, but I recently moved to Taiwan with my wife. I will be returning to Tokyo on the 11th to close out some stuff and go snowboarding.

If you are looking for some off-the beaten track restaurants I may have some suggestions for you.

Personal favorite Tokyo lunch is Saba-Miso-Ni(mackrel with a miso sauce) with natto and raw egg on rice,]]></description>
