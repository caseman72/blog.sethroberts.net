		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Perhaps the inflammation is an overreaction. Maybe it is caused by infection — e.g., infection by bacteria in the mouth.&quot;

I suspect that&#039;s a secondary symptom as well.  The folks who&#039;ve studied non-Western people looking for signs of the diseases of civilization find a lack of heart disease and a lack of tooth decay...

Are you familiar with Burkitt&#039;s &quot;Western Diseases, Their Emergence and Prevention&quot;?  The most fascinating finding from that book was that autoimmune diseases were absent in Africa prior to the adaptation of the Western diet...

		<description><![CDATA[@Jim, I used to have big problems with staining on my teeth.  I had to get my teeth cleaned every three months.  After I started taking flaxseed oil daily, the staining was greatly reduced.  I did not change my flossing or brushing habits, and I didn&#039;t cut down on my coffee consumption (the dental hygienist seemed to think that the staining was caused by the three cups of coffee I drink daily).  I wonder if the staining was related to some sort of inflammatory process.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: Inflammation.

I was doing SLD using flax seed oil for two weeks before my last dental appointment.  My pockets that were 4&#039;s and 5&quot;s magically changed to 2&#039;s and 3&quot;s.  I had my dentist print both the reports because I was so grateful that they stopped talking about some really painful sounding root work.  My brushing and flossing were totally unchanged.  

I was expecting the result because of what I&#039;ve read on the blog, but nothing this good.  I am convinced that taking flax=reduction in gum inflammation, at the very least.]]></description>

I agree with the conclusion of the study. It is weak evidence because the signal isn&#039;t especially strong and the design isn&#039;t terribly good.]]></description>
