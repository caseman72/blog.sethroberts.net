		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s good to do some research about things like calcium. Not only do you need calcium, but magnesium is important too, but most people do not know that they work together. People get enough calcium, but common calcium sources like milk have very little magnesium, so instead, people should focus on getting more magnesium to improve their bone strength. 

If anyone would like to read more about this, here is an article that explains how to make the most from calcium: http://faevia.com/2012/02/getting-the-most-out-of-calcium/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I think epidemiology is a field of study that is particularly ill suited to the modern research environment. The pressure to continuously publish results, especially results pertinent to public health policy, produces mass false positives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree (although I have no idea about the number of false positives). Is epidemiology worse than any other area of health research? I tend to think it is better because it is not distorted by vast amounts of drug company money. All researchers are under pressure to publish.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I think most of the correlations found by epidemiologists do not reflect direct causation; rather than A-&gt;B or B-&gt;A, they usually mean that both A and B have a common cause that was not measured. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am curious why you think this. Your belief seems much stronger than the available evidence warrants. &quot;Most of the correlations&quot; is a very large set. My impression is that most of the correlations discovered by epidemiologists are still unexplained -- that is, we are not sure why they happened. 

To think they suggest cause and effect simply means they make a cause-effect statement (e.g., A causes B) more plausible. Almost always they do. I see nothing wrong with epidemiologists pointing this out. It is also true that an A/B association makes a common cause explanation more plausible. Epidemiologists often point this out, too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have read that only 20% of epidemiological findings turn true in controlled experiments. 80% are refuted.


It is a question of the cost of different mistakes. + whether people can accept information with the idea that it has a very low probability of being true. Many people cannot handle informatiothat way]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While this isn&#039;t directly relevant to the main point of your post, readers might be interested to know that current thinking leans toward the idea that both osteoporosis and arterial calcification are problems not of insufficient/excessive calcium, but of the body&#039;s failure to distribute calcium to its proper places.  Likely candidates for the driving factors include hyperinsulinemia and deficiencies of the fat-soluble vitamins D, K2, and A.  To avoid osteoporosis or heart attacks, there seems to be a good case for supplementing D (or sunlight) and K2.

When your metabolism is putting calcium into the blood vessels instead of the bones, it seems like a reasonable hypothesis that more calcium would increase the risk of heart attack.

Regarding epidemiology:  I think most of the correlations found by epidemiologists do not reflect direct causation; rather than A-&gt;B or B-&gt;A, they usually mean that both A and B have a common cause that was not measured.  Unfortunately, many epidemiologists and nearly all readers of popular science articles have not grasped this.]]></description>
