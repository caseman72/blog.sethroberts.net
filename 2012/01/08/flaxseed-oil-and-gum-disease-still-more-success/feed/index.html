		<description><![CDATA[I have a self-experiment if you are interested. It&#039;s off topic to the post, but interesting, I think. I have familial high-cholesterol - it was 8.4. About twice the norm (I know in America you measure it on a different system). I was prescribed statins but begged for six months to try natural intervention - they told me it wouldn&#039;t work. I took high dose vitamin C and niacin (flushing - not niacinamide/nicotinamide) for six months, but was still nervous at the test. When I rung for my results the nurse told me she had never seen statins work so well. When I said I hadn&#039;t taken any she said the first test results must have been wrong :D I&#039;ve stayed at the high end of normal since then.
Side effect: I used to have terrible acne. Within two weeks of staring that regime (5-10g vitC a day and 50mg niacin when I remembered - about 4-5 times a week) it went away completely. As in.. completely and without recurrence. Through experimentation I&#039;ve determined it was the niacin that had this effect on my skin.
There&#039;s two more for you &#039;anecdotal&#039; files of no scientific significance, Seth!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Anecdotes selectively reported are useless&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There&#039;s a strong statement. Care to provide evidence for it? 

I think I understand your explanation -- you mean that what gets reported will be biased upwards. Sure, it&#039;s clear that if you repeat an experiment you should expect a smaller effect. It&#039;s also true that the first report of an effect is unlikely to be the maximum possible size of the effect...so making a big deal of this bias is not a good idea. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anecdotes selectively reported are useless; and the stronger your reporting bias, the further from truth the effect size becomes - if everyone reports their results, good, if only people with strong effects report, bad, if only people with very strong effects report, even more bad.

Is this an unfair characterization of the anecdotes you post, which are selected for their enthusiasm? Perhaps, but your decline remark is even unfairer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gwern, your use of the term &quot;reporting bias&quot; is different than Wikipedia&#039;s definition: &quot;reporting bias refers to a tendency to under-report unexpected or undesirable experimental results, attributing the results to sampling or measurement error, while being more trusting of expected or desirable results, though these may be subject to the same sources of error.&quot; I have never heard of &quot;reporting bias&quot; being used to mean what you say it means.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have experienced another effect worth mentioning.

I have one pocket, and after eating spareribs (i usually eat full rack, = lots of pork fat), it gets inflammed seriously,

No spareribs, no inflammation.

It was repeated several times.
Initially, i thoughts it is the chewing. (most of my food is not that hard to chew, and i feel the effort different). But then i tried chewing on the other side, or very gently,mbut still inflammation and serious pain!

Once i stopped spareribs, i forgot the pocket, the pain inflammation. As if it never happened......]]></description>
