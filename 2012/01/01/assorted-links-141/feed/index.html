		<description><![CDATA[Here are two opinions I disagree with in the &quot;mass scientific fraud&quot; article:

1. &quot;There is now enough evidence to say what many have long thought: that any claim coming from an observational study is most likely to be wrong – wrong in the sense that it will not replicate if tested rigorously.” I disagree. I think epidemiology has taught us a lot of useful stuff. For example, that heavy smoking causes lung cancer, that folate deficiency causes birth defects. It&#039;s true that epidemiologists persistently overstate the strength of their evidence but that doesn&#039;t mean their evidence isn&#039;t worth anything. To say &quot;any claim&quot; is &quot;most likely to be wrong&quot; is black-and-white thinking, not to mention a vast overstatement.

2. &quot;Science, at its most basic, is the effort to prove new ideas wrong.&quot; Science is also, at its most basic, about coming up with new ideas worth testing. That isn&#039;t easy.]]></description>
