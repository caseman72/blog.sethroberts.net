		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I was wondering about the levels of Vitamin D that some of these people are taking. Various websites I&#039;ve looked up list as low as 600 IU as a recommended maximum dose for adults. At the levels noted here they list a range of negative side effects (mostly due to calcium in the blood).

Are there any long-term vitamin D users at the 3000+ IU level around who are doing well on the blood chemistry front?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been taking 3000 IU for the past two weeks or so. It&#039;s not enough to affect my restfulness much, I think (I&#039;m about 6&#039;5&quot;), but it does keep my sleep schedule regulated; ordinarily, I&#039;d wake up half an hour later every day, but now I wake up between 5 and 7 every day. (Interestingly, I&#039;m much more rested when I wake up at 7 than I am when I wake up at 5 or 6, even if I got less sleep.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been taking my D3 (4,000 IU) at various times throughout the day but haven&#039;t noticed it having any effect on my sleep. (One thing I have noticed having an effect on my sleep was taking iodine in the form of kelp in the morning. It gives me a real boost during the day and helps me sleep better at night.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;If we had consistent sunlight exposure throughout the day, wouldn’t steady dosage of Vitamin D during daylight hours work better? Or is the high “shock dose” just important to program circadian rhythms?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All sorts of things slow down and spread out over time D3 uptake starting with the need to digest the gel around the D3. But I guess that your second idea (&quot;important to program...&quot;) is correct.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder about what Daniel asked too. I might have guessed taking D3 at noon when sunlight is most intense would be the most natural thing to do. In any case after the morning D3 entries started to appear here sometime before Christmas, I switched to taking my D3 first thing in the morning too (between 4-7000 IU) and so far I&#039;ve noticed significantly increased feelings of sleepiness at bedtime, with moderate improvement falling asleep, reduced wakings throughout the night, and much better ability to sleep in.]]></description>
