		<description><![CDATA[I broadly agree with Seth that a lot of science is about funding and prestige and not useful innovation. This can especially be the case with genetics/genomics, which requires massive capital investment and sounds very sophisticated. However, I think you&#039;re being a little premature in writing off the utility of genetics in understanding disease. The greatest promise does not come from accounting for the missing heritability but from discovering relevant biological mechanisms by looking at the genetic influence on disease. There&#039;s no reason why looking for genetic influences on disease and environmental influences on disease have to be in conflict, either: understanding one should help understand the other and build a complete and detailed picture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Professional science has only gotten worse by some standards. The best science is continually getting better. The rate at which science is being done is increasing. However, the average level of science is decreasing. This makes it easier and easier to find examples of bad, sloppy or pointless work being done to satisfy external bean counting. This is sad but it is not reflective of the best work being done. And, to sneer that science is a &quot;job&quot; and hence less meaningful, reliable or whatever is nonsense. I know of no good scientists (the type this blog ignores) who could not at least double their salaries and greatly decrease ther administrative loads by working in industry.

We are driven to do science as a passion and put up with the other nonsense so that we can do what we love not asan end to itself.

The problems mentioned above are real and serious and getting worse. They come from the need for &quot;accountability&quot; to the tax payer and will never improve until we can all be grown ups.

Cheers, Jif.

PS the plural of anecdote is not data.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just reading on the fantastic breakthroughts of gentlemen in the 19th century. For them it was a personal love affair with knowledge, not a job.


There is denigration of simple stuff.
Genes, drugs, enzyms, all ultra sophisticated stuff are over studied.

While simple but emormously useful questions (sleep details. Which mattress is better? Will you be more healthy eating yogurt?) are ignored. As if the glare is most important than life usefulness]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I agree that the whole idea that “genes cause disease” is silly. It’s possible that genes might serve to subdivide a population into groups, some of which might be, for whatever reason, more susceptible to certain diseases, but this in no way implies cause and effect. Take for instance the most basic genetic trait, gender, and one of the most prevelant “diseases”, pregnancy. Being female is certainly a necessary condition for being pregnant, but it is ludicrous to think of it as a cause.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes. I&#039;d put it like this: Genes move susceptibility to this or that environmental deficiency up and down but their effect -- in the case of common diseases -- appears to be so small relative to the environmental influence that &quot;it is ludicrous to think of [them] as a cause.&quot; For example, genes no doubt move susceptibility to scurvy up and down but it is ludicrous to think of them as a cause of scurvy. At the moment this is the empirical picture. Powerful environmental influences, much weaker genetic ones.]]></description>

I agree with Bob that Nielsen&#039;s book is a must if we are to address these issues. For those who won&#039;t buy the book immediately, you can check my recent commentary on this topic:

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;What exactly do you mean regarding genes and disease? It’s already a non-controversial argument that following single genes and developing drugs to target them individually ignores the networks more likely responsible for the disease in question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, I&#039;ve heard that. As far as I can tell, it is pure speculation - meaning there is no evidence -- that these &quot;networks [are] most likely responsible for the disease in question&quot;. I have yet to see a single example where studying genetic networks has led to useful results. If you know of one, I would like to hear about it. 

What is happening here, as far as I can tell, is that when it turned out that Assumption 1 (single genes matter in common diseases) was wrong, biologists have shifted to Assumption 2 (networks of genes matter in common diseases) that has not yet been disproved. They have no evidence for Assumption 2, just as they had no evidence for Assumption 1.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pippard used to draw a distinction between overcrowded and underpopulated fields of science.  The latter can be recognised because even quite important results won&#039;t have been replicated.  The former can be recognised by the ruthless competition to be first to some discovery - and often after one research group gets there first, another one or two groups will get the same result within weeks.  The latter field tends to be characterised, he said, by bad behaviour - his own subject, Physics, was prone to this, he said.]]></description>
