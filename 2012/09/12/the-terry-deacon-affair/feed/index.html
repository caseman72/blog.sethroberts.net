		<description><![CDATA[For the record, Prof. Price directly supplied me with a copy of the letter announcing the investigation and did so WITHOUT making any request of confidentiality.  His accusation that Alicia Juarrerro did something wrong is thus completely disingenuous.  He supplied the letter.  He made no confidentiality request.  She DID NOT supply the letter and has not &quot;broken&quot; a request for confidentiality which she never agreed to in the first place.

At the Institute for the Study of Coherence and Emergence (http://isce.edu) our position on this matter is very clear:  Terry Deacon is a serial plagiarist and UC Berkeley has no interest in dealing with that ugly truth.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: And Professor Price has a poor memory.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are those who believe in openness and transparency; and, there are those who do not in order to protect their position and power. I would expect very little openness and transparency from a political science professor from UC Berkley. 

Developing something new is hard work. Expecting those raised in T-Ball America where no one keeps score and everyone gets a trophy to work hard is no longer the norm. Disciplining a professor for unethical behavior could damage his delicate self esteem. And besides, who&#039;s to judge what is, or isn&#039;t, unethical? 

Everyone gets a trophy. Everyone&#039;s self esteem is intact.]]></description>
