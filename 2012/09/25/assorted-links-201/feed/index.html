		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you said:
&quot;Clayton Christensen’s latest book (about universities) is not good, judging by this review. Christensen has had a stroke, which might explain it.&quot;

I&#039;m not sure that surviving a stroke explains much of anything. I know lots of fellow stroke survivors, and everything depends upon which part of the brain was affected. In my case, I&#039;ve had two fairly mild left-brain ischemic strokes, and the most frustrating problems that they caused me were that they messed up the use of my right hand for handwriting and typing. Dadgummit, I can no longer print small enough to fill in the blanks in the books containing the most challenging New York Times crossword puzzles.

But if you&#039;ll accept a stroke as an excuse for my rambling comments, I&#039;ll take that.]]></description>
