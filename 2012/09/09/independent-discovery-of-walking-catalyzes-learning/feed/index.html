		<description><![CDATA[I find I come up with my most creative ideas when I am moving through space.  This used to be walking in the woods but I can no longer go for those hikes because of health reasons. I do notice that while I&#039;m driving in the car, my mind becomes creative. (This is at times other than rush hour.) I am fascinated with the fact that my mind becomes creative the moment I move. When I stop at stop lights my ideas are put on hold. So I prefer to drive in the open country where they can flow freely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I am thinking about making a treadmill desk. Have you paid attention to your ability to do more creative work while walking? When I say creative work, I mean things like programming, any kind of design, writing.

Thanks in advance, Ilya.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think treadmill walking makes it harder to do creative work, such as writing. I prefer sitting down for that. It puts me in an outer-directed frame of mind (paying more attention to the outside world), while creative work requires introspection.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
