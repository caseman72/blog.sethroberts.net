		<description><![CDATA[Bryan&#039;s comment reminded me, I used the &quot;Walking Effect&quot; when studying for my licensing exam as well. That was before I had a smartphone or knew what Anki was. I made hundreds of paper flashcards with brand and generic drug names on them, then walked for hours around the track at a local high school. The track works pretty well as long as it isn&#039;t too crowded.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But treadmill walking and reading is safer than regular walking if you&#039;re looking down at written material - kind of like walking and texting, which is not really very safe. Regular walking outdoors would certainly work for podcasts - I will have to try that one.  And merely glancing at notes while pacing around indoors wouldn&#039;t seem to be too dangerous. Other than that I think I would stick with treadmills.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, I quickly stopped walking around my neighborhood studying flashcards -- it was too tricky. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I memorizing stuff for the California bar exam, most of the time I was on my feet. I&#039;d either pace around the room reading my notes aloud or walk around campus reading my notecards to myself.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: yes, I will change the title of this post. It&#039;s obviously walking, not necessarily treadmill walking.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like to listen to podcasts while I walk, usually with my dog, and easily walk for an hour, or more, while listening. However, if I try to listen to a podcast while sitting, I go about ten minutes, then realize I can&#039;t remember a thing the person(s) said, and give up. Not that I can remember everything said in an hour long podcast, but I think if I listened to it daily over a period of time, like studying the same flashcards over and over again, I could remember the whole thing. Or, I could become bored with the parts I do remember and subconsciously stop listening. 

Video casts are not as hard to get through, and I think it&#039;s because what you see on the video usually changes from moment to moment - kind of like flash cards - and there&#039;s more of a visual interaction. Probably the influence of television - audio/visual/sedentary conditioning. Ha!

Talk radio is another medium I cannot listen to unless I&#039;m driving or walking. 

I find it all very interesting.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Very interesting. Would online education be better if it were designed to be consumed while walking, instead of looking at a screen?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Seth: That Adam is me!

We actually met a while back when you came to Shanghai for a visit. I&#039;m the Anki/SRS obsessed gentleman who was present at the Korean BBQ.

@Allen K.: I suppose I could study flashcards on my cellphone while walking on nearly any kind of treadmill, but I&#039;m curious what kind you bought. Did you modify it yourself to turn it into a treadmill desk? Does that mean that you use your laptop on it? If you could share some of your methods and/or pictures, I&#039;d really appreciate it.]]></description>
