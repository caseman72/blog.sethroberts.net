		<description><![CDATA[“Push back a little. See what happens.”  This is generally good practice when dealing with experts.

About twelve years ago, I had undertaken some complicated financial transactions, so I hired an accountant to prepare my tax return.  When he showed me a draft of the return, I was stunned at my unexpectedly high tax liability.  I found an area of the return that looked suspicious to me.  The account &lt;i&gt;insisted&lt;/i&gt; that there was no mistake.  But he called me a couple of hours later and admitted that he had inadvertently double-counted some income.

		<description><![CDATA[My friend taught me a brilliant system for what to do when the kids were sick.

First of all, don&#039;t run to the doctor after the first sniffle or cough. When it&#039;s more serious, go for a checkup. The doctor usually prescribes antibiotics. Ask if they are warrented. 

If they are, go home with the prescription but don&#039;t fill it. If by next morning the kid is on the mend, you never need to fill the prescription. 90% of the time, this is what happened.

I rarely ended up filling the prescription. I felt good that at least a health professional had seen my kid to rule out something serious - wouldn&#039;t want to just never go to the doctor to avoid meds.]]></description>
