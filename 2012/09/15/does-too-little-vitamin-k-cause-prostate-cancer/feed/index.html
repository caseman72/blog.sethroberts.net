		<description><![CDATA[A couple of Israeli doctors have published a series of interesting papers where they suggest that BPH and prostate cancer are caused by incompetent valves in the testicular veins. This prevents normal drainage of blood from the testicles, and necessitates pathological flow of blood from the testicles to the prostate. The prostate is thus exposed to enormous levels of testosterone from the testicles, which causes hypertrophy and eventually cancer. (and also increases the conversion of testosterone to DHT, think male pattern baldness)

This vitamin K2 study is interesting. I feel like there&#039;s some obvious connection here between the venous pathology and clotting function that I&#039;m missing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Vitamin K2 does not regulate blood clotting&quot;. Do you happen to have a reference for that? A doctor would not allow a friend of mine to supplement K2 due to some pro clotting genetic defect.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: There is a difference between Vitamin K (blood-clotting) and Vitamin K-2 (other). Apparently that doctor didn&#039;t understand this.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t recall if I found this link here or not, but it is worth posting again if anyone missed it:

http://www.metafilter.com/117835/Vitamin-K2

&quot;... [R]ecent studies have shown that poor Vitamin K2 status is associated with a number of other health issues, including increased risk of coronary artery disease and frature. By directing calcium from soft tissues into your bones, K2 reduces soft-tissue calcificiation, including hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), and increases bone density.

Studies also suggest that Vitamin K2 improves insulin resistance in older men, can be beneficial for patients with leukemia, and may even help patients with Parkinson&#039;s by improving electron transport within mitochondria.&quot;]]></description>
