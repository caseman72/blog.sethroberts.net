		<description><![CDATA[&gt;How much does it cost to produce, package, ship, and advertise a foot and a half of foil? How do you figure this out?

75 sq.ft of AL foil is about $2.50 in a grocery store. 1.5 sq.ft are 5 cents. That of course includes all the costs to produce, package, ship and advertise.

Washing the baking sheet in the dishwasher ~= free if washed with other stuff. Does not happen that often.

Washing the baking sheet manually = cost of water and detergent + time spend.  Water is $1.5/1000 gallons -&gt; negligible, detergent = ~1 cent, time = about a minute of vigorous scrubbing. So if you&#039;re getting paid more than $3/hour or getting more than $3/hour worth of entertainment by not doing the washing, then washing the baking sheet manually may not make sense. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re home energy use, here is the kind of thing I obsess about: you can line a baking sheet with foil before use, and it won&#039;t need washing. But then the foil is dirty and can&#039;t be recycled. Washing the baking sheet requires (heated) water and soap. Which is more energy-efficient? Which is more environmentally sound? Which is cheaper?
(Sometimes you can slip the dirty baking sheet into a &quot;full&quot; dishwasher, which you have to run anyway. And dishwashers are more energy-efficient and cost-effective than washing by hand. I think.)
I have never seen any comparisons of this kind of thing and wish someone would do one; I can&#039;t, as I don&#039;t have the expertise. How much does it cost to produce, package, ship, and advertise a foot and a half of foil? How do you figure this out?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That cooling apparatus is really interesting. Will sports governing bodies ban it? Is it really as amazing as the authors say? Is there (dun dun dun) danger?

The part at the end where the authors disclose their financial interest really dampened the magic for me. :-)
