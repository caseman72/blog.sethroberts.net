		<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;m a Berkeley CS prof who likes teaching large classes.  I like them because (1) I thrive better (go into the zone more easily) in front of a large audience and (2) my department is wise enough to award more teaching credit for large classes.  Perhaps it&#039;s ironic that I&#039;m not really tempted to do an EdX courses because I don&#039;t think I lecture well in a studio.  I need the live audience.

Some of my colleagues in the department seem really excited about their large-scale online courses.  Granted, those are usually upper-division courses like software engineering, and it&#039;s only the full-time lecturers who seem excited about large-scale lower-division courses.]]></description>
