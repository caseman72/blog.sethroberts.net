		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Fermentation of fruits and other sweet foods changes sugars to acids, making the food taste sour&quot;

Some fermented foods taste sour to me (especially vinegars), but meads, wines, liquors, raw fermented honey and raw fermented custard apple have never tasted sour to me (some wines have tasted bitter, but not particularly sour). I find that the best sweet fermented foods are less strongly sweet than fresh domesticated fruits and honeys--a more full-bodied, pleasant sweetness that is not &quot;sickeningly sweet.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He covered this in a video.  I&#039;m not entirely sure because I have watched 2 or 3 by him.  This might be the one where he made the specific point about fungicide -- http://vimeo.com/44715668 -- but he tends to cover the amine stuff in all of them  Interesting watch, anyways.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you seen Dave Asprey&#039;s stuff.  He is saying (and supposedly cites sources, although I have not investigated) that many ferments are now unsafe, because they produce histamine, tyramine, and other -amines.  He says that this has changed as a result of humans applying fungicide to so many soils, which kill 98% of the natural fungi and leave nasty ones behind.  He says that well produced ferments where they are testing the bacteria are ok but that home ferments are not.  I&#039;d love to hear your take on this stuff.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I haven&#039;t seen those comments nor was I able to find them via Google. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But I wonder why many fermented foods seem to be an acquired taste (i.e., they often don&#039;t taste good the first few times you try them).  I still find that to be the case myself.  I recently made a fermented hot pepper sauce (well, more of a &lt;i&gt;paste&lt;/i&gt;, actually) out of habaneros, carrots, onions, garlic, and salt.  The stuff has a pungent odor, and I didn&#039;t actually enjoy it much until I ate it a few times.  Now I find myself craving it, and I&#039;m disappointed that the jar is almost empty.]]></description>
