		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I believe that Seligman also advocates that you can’t change your weight, which is contradicted by your Shangrila Diet research. While I don’t have the book now, I believe it was covered in ” What You Can Change and What You Can’t.” I no longer have the book so I can’t fact check my memory.&quot;

This is the book:

http://www.amazon.com/What-You-Change-Cant-Self-Improvement/dp/1400078407/ref=la_B001ILOB78_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354748794&amp;sr=1-5

It was an interesting investigation into what is changeable and what is not changeable based on the literature.  

here is some guy&#039;s summary:


The results are sobering: from the range of most frequent psychological afflictions, only a few will reliably be relieved by treatment. You can - with appropriate help from a responsible mental health professional - do something about

- panic attacks

- specific phobias (snakes, spiders, flying, etc.)

- sexual dysfunctions.


With other problems, such as depression and addiction, &quot;moderate relief&quot; is the best psychiatrists have to offer, often (when psychoactive medication is used) at a considerable price.

Beyond that,

- enjoy your sexual orientation,

- enjoy your weight (dieting will improve it upwards, in the long run),

- stop blaming unsatisfactory results of your adult life on your childhood and your parents - it won&#039;t do you any good, and there is much less of a causal relationship anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From what I understand,  David Lykken (and collaborators) at the University of Minnesota showed that identical twins raised apart are far more similar in their happiness levels than are fraternal twins raised apart.  Doesn&#039;t this fact argue in favor of a strong heritable (and not very modifiable) component for happiness?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: These are findings about predictability. The more heritable a trait, the more you can predict a child&#039;s value on the trait from his parents&#039; values on that trait. How much you can modify anything depends above all on how well you understand it (e.g., how much you can control your weight depends on how well you understand how weight is controlled). Just because something is highly heritable doesn&#039;t mean it is hard to understand. I doubt there is any correlation.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It is hard to change happiness&quot;

If that is a given, is the implication:

a) You need to put some actual work in to improve your happiness,

or

b) Don&#039;t bother, it would take actual work.

If a), it would be great to have specific things to try out and evaluate in your n=1 laboratory, but I thought Seligman had done quite a bit of this in his popular books.

However, I don&#039;t think you are wrong in being disappointed at shortcomings in  clear communication, useful and new content, and statements contrary to your own knowledge about China.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The audience was psychology professors who do research about happiness and related stuff. The implication was: do research on other aspects of well-being, they will probably be easier to change. This is a perfectly reasonable conclusion. Not because happiness is &quot;mostly genetic&quot; but because in fact it has been hard to change in research studies. (Leaving aside my work with morning faces, which found big effects on happiness.)&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He must have misspoke or you must have misunderstood him. The premise of positive psychology is that happiness is *not* determined by either genetics or circumstances and can be profoundly changed by individual effort.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: He really said this. I didn&#039;t misunderstand him. Because it was so hard to change happiness, he said, positive psychology should also study other things, presumably easier to change. Maybe positive psychology started with that premise (&quot;happiness is *not* determined...&quot;) but it turned out to be wrong. There were lots of things in his talk that it would be nice if they were true but evidence was not presented that came anywhere close to showing they were true.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing  this information, but I am confused by some of your critiques.

under dislike #1: you give the $125 million dollar grant as a prior, then give a hazy remark about one slide being confusing.  Is this really about the results of the Comprehensive Soldier Fitness initiative? If so, the results are organized here: http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/newsletter.aspx?id=1552. If not, perhaps you could clarify.

dislike #3: I think what you are referring to is what Positive Psych calls a &quot;setpoint&quot;. PP&#039;s  happiness formula is h = s + c + v, or happiness = setpoint + conditions + voluntary actions. Seligman never claims that genes determine happiness, rather he says there is a setpoint that can be managed through meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, or psychopharmaceutical drugs like prozac. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to over-generalize Seligman&#039;s supposed over-generalization, given the scope of his research.

The rest of your critiques seem to essentially say &#039;he doesn&#039;t know as much as he thinks he does.&#039; Again, I don&#039;t think it is fair to base such judgments on a 90 minute lecture. If I, for instance, read one of your blog posts about vitamin d3 that does not mention dosage, and relate it to my experience saying &#039;well I&#039;ve been doing 1000 UI every night and my sleep hasn&#039;t improved&#039;, I would be doing myself a great disservice by not looking at your other blog posts before reaching reaching a conclusion

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thank you for your comments, especially the link to the Comprehensive Soldier Fitness Initiative. The appearance of a bizarre and incomprehensible graph in a talk by an extremely prominent psychology professor is what stunned me. Believe me, I would rather have the military spend $125 million on a perfectly plausible psychology-related program than on 5 tanks. It strikes me as a good investment. &quot;Seligman never claims that genes determine happiness&quot; -- in his talk, he said that because happiness was so genetically determined, it was hard to change it. Maybe there&#039;s a first time for everything? Yes, my comment about China&#039;s &quot;good safety net&quot; is a comment about his ignorance. I doubt that somewhere else he shows that he actually knows that China doesn&#039;t have a good safety net. If anywhere in his writing Seligman showed that he understood heart disease epidemiology basics, I believe he would not have said what he said. My last criticism -- where are the treatments that help people? -- is not a comment about ignorance. It is a comment about lack of results.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having read a lot of Seligman, I know he talks about the Lykken finding that 50% of &quot;the pleasant life&quot; is heritable and 50% is environment/choices....

&quot;The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is heritable, about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable.&quot;
http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology.html

He must have forgotten to mention that part, but I think it&#039;s a core part of his ideas.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: There it is again. The idea that &quot;heritable&quot; implies &quot;not modifiable&quot;. It was everyday conversation among Berkeley psych profs 30 years ago that the genes/environment dichotomy was pure nonsense. Sometimes the point was put like this: Is the area of a rectangle determined by its height or its width?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
