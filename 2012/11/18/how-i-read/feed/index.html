		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Aaron on this one. I would be anxious skipping around a narrative. It would spoil my sense of the writer&#039;s structure. I have no trouble with nonlinear storytelling, such the series &quot;Damages&quot; on FX or the movie &quot;Memento&quot;, but I would not enjoy skipping around the story myself.

On the other hand, when I tell my husband a story you would swear I wrote it out on cards and then shuffled them before reading aloud. We&#039;ll have to ask Deborah Tannen if it&#039;s just a wife thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife does that thing with pronouns too -- zooming into stories and anecdotes without telling anyone who she&#039;s talking about. But I believe it&#039;s something many women tend to do. The novelist Tom Perrotta once wrote about a guy whose woman was upset with him and talking in ways he couldn&#039;t follow, but &quot;Dave knew better than to ask her to clarify her pronouns.&quot; My wife tends to get a bit annoyed when I stop her and ask her who she&#039;s referring to -- evidently I&#039;m expected to be totally on board with her thought processes. Or maybe just to read her mind, I&#039;m not sure which.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The guidelines said start in the middle: Talk about someone (“he” this, “he” that) before identifying them.&quot;

This is exactly how my wife talks. She&#039;ll start a conversation in the middle of the story she is relating. I&#039;ve gotten use to it and can follow along quite well (once I ask who &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;them&quot; etc are). When we&#039;re with company, I sometimes have to stop her so the other listeners, who have puzzled looks on their face, can catch on/up. Funny thing is, it never bothers her, she just keeps on telling her story, always with a smile and a laugh.

Cheers]]></description>
