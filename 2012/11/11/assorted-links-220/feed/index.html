		<description><![CDATA[Doctor Susana Duncan said:
&quot;It is not clear that private medical practice as we know it will survive at all under these cuts.&quot;

One can only hope that she is correct! Considering how pathetic and unscientific and profit-driven the USA&#039;s medical system is, the best thing for public health might be to do away with the whole private medical system. 

I&#039;m not a religious believer, but I suspect that faith healing charlatans would do less harm to the public health than the broken system we have now. At least the money-grubbing faith healers wouldn&#039;t be turning millions of people into painkiller addicts.
