		<description><![CDATA[Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying: &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot;

This is always my response when people start asking ridiculous hypothetical questions of morality too (&quot;would you kill the old woman or save the 6 infants from the train car?&quot;). Life is more complicated than black &amp; white dichotomies. What can we do NOW to prevent the old woman &amp; 6 infants situation from occurring at all?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is also a national bias against certain diseases that don&#039;t match the liberal media agenda.

We have just gone through a month-long propaganda campaign to eliminate breast cancer.

I support all efforts to find a cure for breast cancer...but where the heck is the strong effort to find a cure or even a good palliative for osteo-arthritis?
I&#039;ll wager more people suffer from the latter than the former!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, why isn&#039;t it &quot;find a way to prevent&quot; breast cancer rather than &quot;find a cure&quot;? A &quot;search for a cure&quot; helps mainstream medicine. Prevention research, the opposite: fewer people sick, less profit. Yet women obviously benefit much more from prevention research.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
