		<description><![CDATA[Interesting point about Sedaris. I read a couple of his books long ago and I can&#039;t say I ever thought about it at the time (I see now that I missed a big 2007 story about this in TNR) ...but thinking back now it&#039;s obvious that his stories must have been heavily embellished.

I wonder who the most honest modern memoirists are. Even more, I wonder why the non-fiction label is so valuable. So much celebrated fiction is semi-autobiographical that there&#039;s clearly an audience for that too, but I guess the audience for &quot;memoirs&quot; is larger or less crowded?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think the non-fiction label is valuable because other things equal a true story is more impressive than a fictional one. For example, &quot;I was kidnapped by aliens.&quot; If true, much more impressive.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
