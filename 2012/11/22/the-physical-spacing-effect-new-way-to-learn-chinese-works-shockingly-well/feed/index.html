		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having a hard time wrapping my head around this. It&#039;s so simple, and un-intuitive. Placing knowledge and sticking it on a place. 

So now we have a mandarin wall, a programming wall (with different colors), and maybe a to do list on a fridge. Maybe that&#039;s why people put it on the fridge. It&#039;s accessible and people frequently goes to the fridge. Now we just need more walls. LOL]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve failed to keep up my Anki studying as well.  It seems to me it ought to be part of the browser and keep track of everything- emails, feeds, flashcards, etc...
As a separate program it ends up being something I remember I am supposed to be doing whenever I am doing something else; if it were integrated almost everything (including TV) could be in it.  This would be especially useful for those of us trying to limit light exposure at night- maximize our use of daylight computer hours.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: cool idea.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This makes perfect sense. Look up &quot;memory cathedral&quot; - it&#039;s a memory technique used for centuries, where you imagine things you need to remember being in a giant building.

I listen to a lot of podcasts on my iPhone while I&#039;m walking around, and I try to always vary my route. I find that if I ever relisten to those podcasts, I am immediately transported back to where ever I was when I first heard it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is great.

I think this is relevant to graphical user interfaces (GUI&#039;s) in software and web design.  As you experiment with different matrix sizes and so forth, you may want to have a look at Fitt&#039;s Law, for example, and think about the matrix density as something to play with.

The classic PC/Mac desktop is basically a detailed grid of things that one might think would be hard to remember the location of.  But people perform well at this, many people even prefer messy desktops since they have little trouble remembering where things are.  I once had a coworker who would occasionally just cut and paste most of the shortcuts on his Desktop (including the *old* &quot;Old Desktop&quot; folder) into a folder called &quot;Old Desktop&quot;, which was then placed in a corner of the new (mostly blank) desktop.  This created a series of fossilized &quot;layers&quot; of desktops.  He was quite fast at finding even old, obscure things with this.  The Windows Phone and new Microsoft Windows 8 user interface (formerly called Metro) conventions seem to rely on this sort of capability, and take it to the next level.  

Similarly, if you think about the detailed sequence of relatively precise locations many people learn with muscle memory in order to quickly navigate hierarchical menus, it&#039;s the same -- people are good at mapping positioning to recall of lots of items.

What I wonder is have you tested in a way that neutralizes the positioning during recall.  In other words, is your learning still great when you can&#039;t look at the matrix during recall?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I have done a test where the recall test for two types of study -- conventional, with everything in one place, and new, with different things to be learned in different places -- and found a huge advantage for the new way. However, it was just one test. I will do more tests where the testing method is the same for the two types of learning.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anki has a Mandarin plug-in that automatically converts pinyin into color-coded text.

Sometimes the tones it selected were wrong though &amp; I didn&#039;t find it that helpful, but maybe I didn&#039;t give it enough time.

One thing I used temporarily when I was struggling with tones was to visualize the characters in a location associated with the tone. The rising tone characters were in the attic, the declining tone characters in the basement, the 3rd tone characters on a teeter-totter, &amp; the flat tone characters were images in the flat glass table in my dining room.

If I see the character for rabbit, I know it is rabbit. I might not remember what tone it is though. Then I remember, the rabbits are all running wild in the basement &amp; I know that rabbit must be 4th tone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One other thing you might try with those flash cards on your wall, which I&#039;ve found generally helpful, is to print the characters in colors according to tone (e.g. all first tone characters are blue, etc). Seems to make remembering the tones much easier, at least for me, when I see the character in my mind I see it in color and subsconsciously that seems to make me associate it with the tone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve also been studying Chinese, with varying degrees of motivation, over the past couple years.  It is a constant process of relearning things I have forgotten.  But after a break, I find that I usually come back strong, relearning what I had forgotten and picking new things faster than in the past.  I have noticed that it gets easier and easier to learn new characters - I assumed that it was because I have become more familiar with the radicals, tones, sounds and connections between the characters.  So while there may be something to the physical spacing, don&#039;t discount the previous hundreds of hours you&#039;ve spent &quot;preparing&quot; your mind to learn.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You make good points. The sudden jump in learning speed -- I never came anywhere close to learning 75 characters in a day -- is what impresses me.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I guess where I&#039;m confused is how this differs from what you were doing in the first paragraph. Is it that now you actually study them, whereas before they just hung there and you mostly ignored them?

		<description><![CDATA[This effect of &#039;memory loci&#039; really is a strong one, and ignoring it is one major flaw of book e-readers. There is a tactile and spatial component to navigating and remembering the contents of a physical book that is almost completely missing in ebook readers. 

Unfortunately, the current thinking seems to be that the indicator of current position in a book is a distraction, and the trend is to hide it most of the time. I think it actually needs to be made more prominent and ever-present

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, that&#039;s a good point.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I seem to be a bit slow today, but could you spell out exactly what the technique is? You seem to be testing yourself with flashcards, then hanging the ones you don&#039;t know on the wall to look at occasionally. Is that right/100% of it?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s close. Yes, it is very simple. I just hung a deck of flashcards on the wall. I knew some of them sort of. The technique: Put the flashcards you want to learn on the wall (as in the picture). Study them. That&#039;s all. Result: I learned them much much faster and with much less effort than I did with other ways of studying flashcards.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used Anki to review Chinese characters for Japanese (about 2100 everyday-use ones), but it would&#039;ve been much harder without using Heisig&#039;s mnemonic system to initially &quot;learn&quot; them. It&#039;s all a waste of time if you don&#039;t actually get any practice though. Reading isn&#039;t such a big deal, but writing requires quite a bit of effort for me. I&#039;ve been trying to learn shorthand, which is a whole other beast, since writing them out in full looks ridiculously unnatural. Luckily, people generally type nowadays instead.]]></description>

It should be like this:

I know what you mean about falling behind on Anki reviews. I have over 1500 cards due right now in my Intermediate Mandarin deck.

It may even be possible to use locations in a similar way within a program like Anki. I was trying to remember that the Tuberoinfundibular pathway is in the Arcuate nucleus &amp; that the Arcuate nucleus is in the Hypothalamus. I had a couple of cards to memorize these &amp; just kept failing over and over again. At last, I figured it out:

Step 1. Chunk Hypothalamus, Arcuate nucleus, &amp; Tuberinfundibular pathway together into one piece: HAT.  (1st letter of each name)

Step 2. Create a spatial schematic. Mine is:

Hypothalamus
  Arcuate nucleus
    Tuberoinfundibular pathway

(Hopefully my spaces are not parsed out! Should be  on the 2nd line &amp;  on the 3rd)

For whatever reason, this makes it incredibly easy for me to remember the components &amp; their relation to one another. I can see it in my head, whereas before I was just *describing* it in my head.]]></description>
