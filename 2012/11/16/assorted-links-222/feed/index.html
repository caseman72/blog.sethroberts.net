		<description><![CDATA[Animal self-medication? Really?

So animals, living in the wild, are able to take actions to ward off diseases and pathogens? You mean that millions of years of Darwinian evolution have selected for healthful behaviors?

Nobody who understands evolution should be surprised. But BigPharma and their shill salespersons (a.k.a. MDs) keep insisting on drugs and surgeries and devices that interfere with naturally evolved healing processes.

Do very many medical schools even bother to teach courses -- or majors -- in evolutionary medicine to medical students? Of course not! BigPharma companies and their shill doctors would lose billions in annual profits if people would follow other animals&#039; examples and just eat fresh natural foods.
