		<description><![CDATA[Also, the first link is broken. I think Roberts meant &quot;Sleep and Immune Function&quot;, Ganz:

&gt; Scientists are only beginning to fully understand the purpose of sleep and its underlying mechanisms. Lack of sleep is associated with many diseases, including infection, and with increased mortality. Lack of proper sleep is an important problem in the intensive care unit, and interventions have been designed to improve it. Sleep is associated with immune function, and this relationship is partially based on the physiological basis of sleep, sleep architecture, the sleep-wake cycle, cytokines and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of magnesium, I&#039;ve been messing with another common biological metal: potassium.

Rather than improving my sleep like magnesium reputedly does, potassium seems to be damaging my sleep quality. It&#039;s weird since I can&#039;t think of any reason why this would be happening, and the only research I&#039;ve found is an old study where potassium improved sleep quality!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jim E, 
thx for the link,
do you know at what time in the video she &quot;gives the protocol for getting the right amount&quot; 

i only have a mobile connection at the moment which is tight on bandwidth &amp; expensive

cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth I just watch a video explaining the vitamin D and sleep connection. It also gives the protocol for getting the right amount. Lots of opportunity for personal science. This link came from a comment on Emily Dean&#039;s blog.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7cbBB1c0IM]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[if you are in a hurry to buy some magnesium oil (magnesium chloride), you may find smaller quantities in the supermarket.
probably in the asian section &amp; labelled as Nigari.
It&#039;s used as a coagulant for making Tofu.

		<description><![CDATA[Transdermal magnesium is typically sold at &quot;magnesium oil.&quot;  (The &#039;oil&#039; is a misnomer; it&#039;s called that because magnesium dissolved in water has a slippery feel.)

The &#039;magnesium oil&#039; products are typically sold in small, pretty bottles at big markups, but i noticed that the ingredients were just magnesium chloride and water.  Bulk magnesium chloride is very cheap, and I got mine here:

bulkreefsupply.com/brs-bulk-magnesium-chloride-aquarium-supplement.html

I mix a few tablespoons of the powder at a time in a pint of water and keep it in a small bottle in my shower/bath.  Occasionally I will sit in the bathtub, pour some of the mixture onto a clean sponge and take a sponge bath of it before bed.  (If I have the concentration too high, there will be a slight stinging sensation like a mild sunburn that disappears immediately upon rinsing off.)

The soporific effect doesn&#039;t happen every time, and I suspect may depend on how magnesium replete one is (that&#039;s conjecture).   When it happens, 30 minutes to an hour after the sponge bath I&#039;ll begin to feel very sleepy.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a placebo effect, though. The first time it happened was when I tried a sponge bath mid-day and wound up so sleepy that I wound up sleeping the rest of the day.

One benefit of taking magnesium transdermally is there is no laxative effect (which is common when taking magnesium orally.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A quick note: Ray Cronise is finding that cold stress (cool baths , showers) helps sleep. 

Also , I&#039;ve found that transdermal magnesium before bed helps sleep.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The magnesium might be worth a try. what brand and dose of transdermal magnesium do you use? I found cold showers produced weight gain and mental slowing.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
