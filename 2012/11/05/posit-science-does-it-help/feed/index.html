		<description><![CDATA[When it comes to Brain training I would like to see how Posit Science compares to Anki.
Anki is also mentally challenging and I would expect similar effects on the measures that the IMPACT studied.

On the other hand Anki has the additional advantage of helping you learn knowledge.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, that would be a good comparison.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Dr. Roberts,

I&#039;m the CEO of Posit Science, and an author on the IMPACT papers - I saw your blog post and thought I could shed some light on your questions. Generally, this information is covered in our publications, but was too detailed to have on our web pages. They are great questions!

1) Active Control: We picked an active control that was comparable to what doctors currently recommend - which is to stay cognitively active. People in this group learned from educational DVD&#039;s (like Cosmos, History of Art, and so forth) and took quizzes each day on what they learned. This was a good control for our study because we could match the time spent on cognitive training, and people enrolled in this arm believed that this activity could help their cognitive function - so we could maintain the study blind for participants.

2) Self-Report Measure: The CSRQ has 25 questions, with questions like &quot;I have felt I have a good memory&quot;, rated 1 (almost always) to 5 (hardly ever) over the past two weeks of time. In clinical trials like this, the best way to consider the magnitude of the effect is an effect size measure - we use the standard Cohen&#039;s d measure. On this measure, the effect on standardized neuropsychological tests is about 0.25, which is equivalent to ~10 years of cognitive function. The effect size on the self-report measure was about the same, indicating that the improvement in objective measures of cognition matched the improvement in subjective measures - people really noticed the changes in themselves. There are a few mood questions on the CSRQ, because mood and cognition are related, however repeating the analysis with the mood questions removed doesn&#039;t affect the results - the effect is the same just considering the core cognition questions.

We are proud of the clinical trials that we and our scientific collaborators have run - we think that this kind of evidence is crucial to the field of brain training, and we&#039;re proud to have been involved in all of the largest and best executed studies in the field.

Thanks for your interest in our work!

Best regards,
Henry Mahncke
CEO, Posit Science

&lt;strong&gt;Seth&#039;s response to Dr. Mahncke: Thanks for your answers. I understand what you say about the control group. About the size of improvement on the all-important real-world measures, however, I disagree that &quot;the standard Cohen&#039;s d measure&quot; is a good way to measure effect size. For an academic audience, maybe, but I am sure that the typical visitor to your website has no idea what that is. To convince me that your treatment reduced cognitive age by ten years, I would want to see three things: (a) All the questions of the CSRQ-25 so I could see what is being measured. (b) How the CSRQ-25 score (with the mood questions omitted) varies with age. You seem to say that the average score gets worse by 0.07 in 10 years. I am unsure that this is the case. I saw no evidence supporting that claim. (c) The effect of the IMPACT treatment on the score-versus-age function. It would be especially good to see the score versus age function separately for the two groups in the IMPACT study. A graph showing both functions (one for each group) would make it much clearer if your claim of 10 years improvement is reasonable. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See also this article from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; (Oct. 31):

&quot;&lt;a&gt;The Brain Trainers&lt;/a&gt;&quot;

I&#039;ve only had time to read the first few paragraphs, but Posit Science is mentioned in the article (along with some other companies that are similar).
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: The NY Times article suggests that parents with learning disabled children will pay enormous prices for training (e.g., $10,000/year) and the training does help. That&#039;s a considerably different target population than the one aimed at by the Posit Science website: old people.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
