		<description><![CDATA[ob, thanks for your post. I agree with everything you said. While the salt-hypertension effect is small on a population level, it can be quite large (or even slightly inverse) in individuals. There are a few studies out there showing individual responses in addition to group averages. It would benefit personal science tremendously if more studies reported data in this way.

Do you have a good reference for the insulin/sodium connection? My insulin levels were low before going low carb, so I question that theory a bit, even though the guideline to add salt to a low carb diet is widely supported by the clinical experience of doctors working with these diets -- it&#039;s only the &quot;why&quot; I&#039;m questioning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few thoughts
You would like reading some of the literature where the have salt loaded the victions, I mean subjects. I think there was some food mixed in with the salt somewhere. I have read studies where they fed subjects up to 20grams of salt a day!
Amphibians, mammals and then humans all evolved from the sea and our bodies mineral composition is similar to sea water but a bit more dilute. When we left the sea we had to carry a bit of it around inside us and balance input (diet) and output(excretion in urine and sweat).
Salt excretion rate is influenced by insulin levels. if you insulin is low you tend to lose more salt. Conversely if you insulin is high you retain more fluid and salt. The salt hypertension link is pretty weak with experiments showing a change of only a few mmHg with large changes in salt content in diet. Some of the salt hypertension link may be a de facto meaasurement of insulin and metabolic syndrome rather than salt per se.
Paleo style diets are very low salt- input minus output will allow balance to be maintained until one begins to exercise or is in a hot climate as salt s lost thru sweating. Peak sweat rates can result in a loss of 1-3g sodium/hour.  People on a low sodium diet will sweat less salt but still significant amounts eg 1g/hour under hard working conditions. Natural meats, vegetables and fruits will amount to a similar order of magnitude with urinary loss of say 0.5 g or so per 24 hours. Hot weather and exercise tip the balance. Low carb style diet with ketosis would mean that negative sodium balance and hyponatremia is pretty much inevitable under these conditions. Persistance humters, who high heat tolerance, meant they could hunt down prey vunerable by a less developed internal heat management system. However, they would have lost a lot of salt... So, there must have been other sources of salt in the diet. 
As well as shellfish there may have been other &quot;salt sources&quot;&quot; eg 
-blood consumption is known as well as liver consumption (with blood), 
-certain plants accumulate salt
- marine species mentioned
-mineral waters- these vary in salt content some are quite significant, traditional eskimos cooked with &quot;öld&quot;sea ice which was mildly salty, the waters we get from the water company generally have low mineral content. 
geophagy is in some cases from clays etc that contin significant amounts of salt but it may have other roles as well, 
many mammals\birds will use natural salt licks and early humans may have done the same- eventually social evolution may have meant they learnt to carry the salt lick around with them.
some animals will lick each other as a cleaning and social ritual- have never heard of primitive humans doing so.
Salt like many dietary and environmental factors seems to be something that there are certain amounts needed to achieve an optimal outcome. Many of the low carb &quot;gurus&quot;recommend adding 1-2 grams of salt to diet a day. Certainly worth doing during hot weather or on days when you active exercise.
Still trying to work out a better guideline (that doesnt involve consuming blood, eating dirt or similar practices).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Greg,

Thanks for you feedback on this. A while back, I had read the book called &quot;The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living&quot; by Phinney and Volek and I remember something about low carb - high fat diets and salt intake. I am not sure whether you have to maintain the 5g/day of sodium low carb post-adaptation but I can look it up again, I must have the book around here. FYI, I did experience a little bit of constipation at the beginning, but it is all fixed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Johnn, thanks for the comment. Salt loading at high  elevation makes sense since it is easier to lose fluids up there (via respiration). Curious if you have noticed any effect of the magnesium? I took it for a while and it didn&#039;t seem to do anything.

The 6 pound gain was certainly noticeable, largely because I was just ending the low salt phase during which I was dehydrated. I got a moderately bad headache but felt fine in the morning.

James, I have heard the advice to add salt during &quot;induction&quot; of a low carbohydrate diet but not so much emphasis on it once adapted (I&#039;ve eaten low carb for years). It is quite possible that low salt would have worked better with more carbs in the diet, though I did not experience constipation or the other symptoms typically associated with the initial low carb adaptation period. 5g/day of sodium is quite a lot -- is that recommended after adaptation to low carb and if so by whom?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

When going low carb, you&#039;d better not restrict salt or you will suffer from some quite undesirable side-effects, the most common one being constipation. I also think, IIRC, that you will start losing potassium due to salt depletion. You don&#039;t want that ...

Anyway, as soon as you go low carb, you have to increase your intake of salt. 5g/day of sodium should do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg,
Thx for the thoughtful and detailed note on your experiment w salt.
I loaded salt and small amount of potassium bicarbonate and magnesium citrate into gel capsules and 2-3 of those (4-6 gms) during hiking at high altitude. I found it largely offset my loss of physical endurance at high level of exertion since going low carb.
Other situations that this method of salt supplement helps me personally are: fasting (reducing a slight headache), preventing mental fatigue (during long distace driving).
6 lbs of fluid retention is a lot. I never notice it personally. Is there noticeable sign?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do not have a null hypothesis to reject because I was not testing a hypothesis regarding infections or thermoregulation. I&#039;m not seeking to prove or disprove these associations. I reported these results because they are highly unusual (they never hapened before) and because they are biologically plausible.

The 8 pound shift is not graphed. The graph shows daily weight, measured consistently as described under Figure 3, not intra-day weight changes. Weight varies more during any given day than from day to day due to food and water consumption and excretion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Re 1 and 3: The likelihood that these two changes (which had never happened to me before) were coincidences is much lower than the likelihood that they were caused by the intervention. Both outcomes have biological plausibility (though I have not seen prior reports associating infections with salt restriction). I would not necessarily call these “discoveries” but they are important observations that should be reported.

I don&#039;t follow. You mean you, in advance, expected that staph and thermoregulation problems would occur and this is why you are rejecting the null? What&#039;s the base-rate for either of these, combined with the selection effect of watching like a hawk for any change whatsoever? If you weren&#039;t expecting in advance those specific two problems, then you are misframing the problem all the way from the start: now the right question is, what is the base rate of any out of the ordinary event at all? (Quite high - as the old point about the lottery goes, it&#039;s surprisingly for a particular person to win, but it&#039;s not surprising that any particular person won. See also Littlewood&#039;s Law.)

&gt; Re 4: there was some level of quantification but not enough to graph in a useful manner (there are insufficient data points). This observation has more to do with how I was feeling.

I see.

&gt; Re 6: increase in extra cellular fluid is the only explanation I can think of that could describe an 8 pound change in body weight in this time frame, but I’m open to suggestions if you can think of a better one. I am fairly certain that I did not eat an extra 8 pounds of food for dinner.

I don&#039;t see an 8lb change graphed... Where&#039;s this 8lb stuff coming from? Your graph can&#039;t even show an 8lb change since it only spans 6lbs, from 155 to 161.

I see 1 datapoint for the first phase, almost useless, and variation within the second phase far exceeding variation between the second phase and third phase. I also see a second phase which is increasing just before the transition and decreasing just after the transition. Or, look at the weight graph: between the last green point and the first blue point is 2lbs. 2lbs isn&#039;t much of a change, it looks like there are other places in the graph where 2lb shifts occur (and speaking from my personal experience, 2lb shifts happen all the time for me despite no salt experiments).]]></description>

Re 5: given impaired thermoregulation, infection and strength loss, I have concluded that the low salt diet was unhealthy. However, I did not crave salt and my appetite adjusted to the lower intake. There is a body of literature on this question which I did not write up -- the existence of sodium appetite in humans has been a controversial topic. It seems clear at this point that it does exist when sodium levels are critically low, but that it is extremely difficult in humans to deplete sodium to the extent necessary. My experiment did not reach the requisite level, nor should anyone attempt it without medical supervision. See the paper by Geerling and Loewy for an excellent discussion of this (&quot;Central Regulation of Sodium Appetite&quot;, Experimental Physiology 2008).

There is a body of literature on this question which I did not write up &#8212; the existence of sodium appetite in humans has been a controversial topic. It seems clear at this point that it does exist when sodium levels are critically low, but that it is extremely difficult in humans to deplete sodium to the extent necessary. My experiment did not reach the requisite level, nor should anyone attempt it without medical supervision. See the paper by Geerling and Loewy for an excellent discussion of this (&#8220;Central Regulation of Sodium Appetite&#8221;, Experimental Physiology 2008).</p>
<p>Re 6: increase in extra cellular fluid is the only explanation I can think of that could describe an 8 pound change in body weight in this time frame, but I&#8217;m open to suggestions if you can think of a better one. I am fairly certain that I did not eat an extra 8 pounds of food for dinner.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Nifty stuff but the conclusions seem overstated.

Conclusions #1 &amp; #3 are not data-based but retrospective &amp; subjective, and about rare things in the first place: what, do you get staph every other day? How could you draw any conclusion about rare events like that?

#4 could have been quantified but I don&#039;t see any graphs for it.

#5 is reasonable but the claim about listening to your body sort of begs the question that either of the salt extremes were unhealthy enough that you should have noticed.

#6 doesn&#039;t mention that the weight returned to normal; when I see 2 spikes on the graph corresponding to both transitions, I wonder to myself &#039;is this a Hawthorne effect where the stress of changing entirely his diet causes him to overeat a little bit?&#039;]]></description>
