		<description><![CDATA[I read the book when it came out and followed it for a short while but here recently I realized that I had been following the protocol unwittingly.  I had been taking MCT oil to drive up my ketone levels.  It is almost completely flavorless and has other benefits as well if anyone wants to give it a try.  I recommend the Now brand easily found on amazon.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Since you started the MCT oil (how long ago?), has your weight changed?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I bought a noseclip used by swimmers, but it wasn&#039;t tight enough, and I could still taste whatever I was consuming.  I now pinch my nose shut with my hand when I take coconut fat, and I drink four or five mouthfuls of warm water (after sloshing it around my mouth first).  When I drink flaxseed oil, I don&#039;t pinch my nose.  Perhaps I should -- maybe I&#039;d lose more weight if I did.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Some of the noseclips I&#039;ve used are adjustable. Some aren&#039;t.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I tried the Shangri-la diet but not rigorously enough. I wanted to make another go at it since the other diets that work (like low carb) are proving too hard for me. 

I tried with flax seed oil and nose clipping but there was always a after taste. I like flax seed oil but fear that the it was not flavorless enough to qualify.

Will taking fish-oil capsules satisfy as &quot;taste less calories&quot; instead of extra-light olive oil? 

thanks for your blog - it is a trove of ideas!

:)
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Yes, capsules = smell-less calories. However, you have to take a lot of capsules/day (about 30, too many, in my opinion) to get enough calories. You might try rinsing your mouth with water after nose-clipping flaxseed oil.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
Any good books on understanding p values, bayesian probability and how its used in scientific research? I have a hard time grasping these concepts.

		<description><![CDATA[One of my preferred theories (not mentioned here) is regression to the mean: diet is part of a very complicated system, and making a big change to your diet is akin to taking a reroll; if your health is below average it has a good chance of being an improvement, simply by regression to the mean. Shangri-La is unusual in that it has a high change-size-to-effort ratio (10+% of calories without needing to learn any recipes or discard any foods).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I can’t say why this happens (why an incomplete inferential logic, centered on p values, remains standard), but it has the effect of making good work less distinguishable from poor work.&quot;

I think you just answered your own question.  

There&#039;s a whole industry of academies, scientists working at those academies, and journals those scientists publish in to advance at their acadamies that depends on good work being less distinguishable from poor work.

A better standard might reveal that a lot of those scientists aren&#039;t doing valuable work...

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Why would a journal editor care about protecting them? My favored explanation is inertia.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
