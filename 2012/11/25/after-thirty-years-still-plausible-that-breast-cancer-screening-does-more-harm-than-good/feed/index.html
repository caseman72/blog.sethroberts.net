		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having a hard time grasping your take on the 98% vs 23% issue - could you spend a few words on that?
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: If a disease is detected earlier it will be survived longer, even if nothing else changes. Even if it is not treated. Breast cancer left untreated would be survived longer if it were detected earlier. So the mere fact of better five-year survival does nothing to support screening campaigns. Reasonable comparisons were available: age-equalized rates of dying of breast cancer for women who are and are not screened, for example. Results of experiments, even better. Yet the proponents of screening chose a grossly misleading comparison. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ACR/SBI: Bleyer and Welch Breast Cancer Screening Article in NEJM Deeply Flawed and Misleading

The article by Bleyer and Welch[1] in the New England Journal of Medicine, which suggests that screening mammography finds many cancers that would not advance to kill patients, is based on false assumptions. The thesis depends on their suggestion that the incidence of breast cancer is much higher than would have been expected had screening not been initiated.

The authors suggest that the baseline incidence of breast cancer would have increased by 0.5percent each year, when in fact, the data show that it would likely have increased by twice that amount. The incidence of invasive breast cancer has actually increased by 1percent per year for decades.[2] In 1940, it was 60/100,000. By 1980, prior to any screening, it had risen to 100/100,000. If there had been no screening, and the rate had continued to increase as it had for 40 years, the incidence in 2008 would have been over 130/100,000. In fact, due to prevalence screening, where new women who have never been screened enter the screened population each year, and lead time (cancers found earlier due to screening), the incidence of breast cancer, without any &quot;overdiagnosis&quot; would have been expected to be even higher than 130/100,000. In reality, it was lower even than that, at 127/100,000.

Therefore, not only is there no evidence of the authors&#039; claimed &quot;overdiagnosis,&quot; but it is likely that treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) over the past decades has reduced the incidence of invasive cancers. This is in addition to the observed 30 percent reduction in deaths each year due largely to screening. While the authors observe that screening is associated with a reduction in advanced stage cancers, they fail to recognize the fact that a reduction in advanced stage disease is not required to have a reduction in deaths from screening. Staging is a crude effort to group cancers for purposes of trying to understand how they respond to therapy. Unfortunately, there are deaths from breast cancer among women with all stages of these malignancies, even the very earliest, DCIS.

The thesis by Bleyer and Welch is simply wrong. Misleading articles, based on faulty assumptions and methodology are counterproductive. If such misinformation is used to determine screening guidelines and recommendations, the cost may be lost lives.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Thanks. This can be found at

It would be more interesting if (a) it was attributed to someone and (b) it didn&#039;t make a big mistake in the very beginning. Bleyer and Welch did not suggest that &quot;the incidence of breast cancer is much higher than would have been expected had screening not been initiated&quot;-- that is, that screening increased breast cancer. They concluded that screening did not lower the rate of life-threatening breast cancer. The stuff about the incidence of breast cancer is irrelevant. No one says that screening is supposed to change the rate of breast cancer -- it just detects some breast cancers earlier than they would otherwise be caught.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The above article and some of the comments are about as relevant as those who have never had a sexual experience but feel qualified to write and comment about sex.  My qualifications to discuss the subject of screening are that I have been involved in breast cancer screening and surgical operations for over 40 years.
Money was not the motivation.  Decreasing true misery was the motivation.
First you must accept that people do get breast cancer.  There may be differing levels of aggressiveness but you cannot always define the level as easily as may be thought.  Most of you were not present when we did &quot;radical mastectomies&quot; requiring multiple blood transfusions as the only treatment.  Most of you were not there when such patients frequently required post operative psychiatric care.  Most of you were not there when radiation was primitive and we did not even have good chemo.  So yes, there is waste, false positives, anxiety and increased cost.  All of it worth it when 80% + of the patients can have lumpectomies and save their breasts, require less psychiatric care, and have better qualities of life.  Don&#039;t throw out the baby with the wash.  Refine the indications and frequency required for screening mammography. Perhaps every 2 or 3 years rather than annually.  Find ways to reduce cost by having technicians read films rather than radiologists and only have radiologists for more difficult situations.  The cynicism and false expertise noted above are offensive to those of us who have been on the front lines, seen the worst and are truly happy for the not-so-perfect improvements that we currently have.

		<description><![CDATA[Research into cancer prevention is worth pursuing, but so is the development of reliable screening tools.  I think few would dispute that when cancer is detected and treated early - before metastasis - lives are saved.  That&#039;s why Welch&#039;s findings are so surprising.

What I get out of the op-ed isn&#039;t that cancer screening is useless, but that for some reason mammography is a poor screening tool.  Maybe breast tumors that eventually advance to late-stage cancer grow so quickly that a biennial mammography is unlikely to catch them in time.  Or maybe it&#039;s a mistake to focus on gray and white blotches on a mammogram; we should be looking at biochemical blood markers instead.  In any case, early detection should still be a major emphasis in cancer research.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The op-ed makes me think the whole thing should be investigated: how did such a big mistake come to happen? Was evidence ignored? Misleading? Or what?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
