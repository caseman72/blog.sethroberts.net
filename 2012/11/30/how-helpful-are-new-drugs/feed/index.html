		<description><![CDATA[I meant that physicians who prescribe newer vintages might help their patients in other ways. This is a different from saying that patients who are prescribed newer vintages are different from those who aren&#039;t.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for clarifying that.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is a bit of a stretch to say that the new drug vintage patients are likely to be healthier on unobservables when they are not healthier on observables. Obviously it is theoretically possible as you point out, but why is it probable? 

I completely agree with the doctors point, by the way. That is a valid criticism of this research design.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: What do you mean by &quot;the doctors point&quot;? I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t understand.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;the disappearance of infectious disease as a major source of death. &quot;

Are not drug companies are due a lot of the credit, for example through developing the manufacture of penicillin ? Without drugs, would not infectious diseases  such as tuberculosis still be a terrible scourge ?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Drug companies did not invent vaccines. Far from it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But what is healthy eating?

Obviously it must include fish and chips for Friday lunch, bacon and egg at least once a week, the occasional beer, a glass of wine with dinner most evenings, toast and marmalade at breakfast, lots of tea and coffee, and plenty of smoked salmon, sardines, mackerel pate, pork pies, muscat grapes, cherries in brandy, hummus and olives, apples and cheese, duck, lamb, roast vegetables, baked potatoes, watercress sandwiches, parsnip soup, ... and generally Things I Like.

		<description><![CDATA[This is a little uncharitable it seems to me. Drug vintage isn&#039;t correlated with BMI, smoking status or a large number of medical conditions. If what you&#039;re saying were true, we wouldn&#039;t expect this. Those using newer drugs should be healthier. You need to have a more sophisticated story to refute Lichtenberg&#039;s argument.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think Lichtenberg -- and anyone else who wants to know the value of new drugs -- should consider these alternatives. Perhaps there is data that will help assess them. Lack of significant correlation with BMI, etc., isn&#039;t much of an argument. Let&#039;s take BMI. Maybe current advice about how to reduce BMI isn&#039;t very good? Lots of people are health-conscious and weigh more than they would like. Take smoking. Maybe this is heavily determined by culture? Take Medical Condition X. Maybe we don&#039;t know how to prevent Medical Condition X? So that even people who do conventionally healthy things (e.g., &quot;eat healthy&quot;) still have Medical Condition X at the same rate as those who don&#039;t eat healthy. Maybe these indices of health (BMI, etc.) are insensitive? Because if people live longer, shouldn&#039;t they be healthier (weigh less, etc.) while they are alive? 

Quite apart from that, lack of significant correlation with BMI, etc., does nothing to refute the possibility that good doctors help their patients in important ways besides prescribing newer drugs.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
