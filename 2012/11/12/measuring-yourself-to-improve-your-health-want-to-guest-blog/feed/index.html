		<description><![CDATA[My two main areas of interest are (1) mitigating my ADHD (I&#039;ve been taking medications on and off since I was a teenager and don&#039;t like that) and (2) more recently, dealing with energy levels.

Recently I was feeling very sluggish on a daily basis at work and easily getting energy crashes right before and right after lunch.  The main culprit here was probably the medications I take; during a period of time where I was off of them but on a low-carb diet, my energy levels were very stable.

That aside, I started engaging in a relatively simple self-experiment but it&#039;s not very formal and doesn&#039;t have much in the way of data.  I got a hunch, from a Leangains.com post on cortisol and breakfast, that having coffee with my breakfast was causing seriosu insulin spikes and leaving my energy in an extremely volatile state.  Lately, I&#039;ve started waiting around an hour after a meal before having anything caffienated.  The results are mixed, but generally good.

That said, this week I have a lot of energy despite the tactic failing me last Thursday and Friday.  Odd too because this weekend I was feeling a bit &quot;blah&quot; and was out late drinking a lot.  I&#039;m wondering if it was just much needed rest (I don&#039;t take medications on weekends), or if it had something to do with consuming carbohydrates (I was eating more carbs than usual, partially to nurse hangovers.)  I sometimes find that strategically placed carbohydrates have a positive effect on me.

This all feels a bit too vague and simple to talk about on your blog but I thought it wouldn&#039;t hurt to talk about my most recent adventure in self-monitoring.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can think of a few important cross-disciplinary contributions to biology in the 20th century --

Linus Pauling: physicist, and a founding father of molecular biology (also a health self-experimenter).

Max Delbruck: astrophysicist who made significant discoveries in microbiology.

Alan Turing: founding father of computer science, founding father of computational biology.

Carl Woese: molecular biologist, revolutionized the science of evolution.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Delbruck changed fields. He was a professional biologist. Woese is a professor of microbiology, which is where his contributions are. If he were a professor of physics, I&#039;d agree with you. Sure, the people who start a field are going to by definition come from outside that field. E.g., Ebbinghaus (one of the originators of experimental psychology) was a philosopher.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, in any discussion of specialist and non-specialist behaviors, I think we should consider the natural herding behavior of most people, both specialists and non-specialists.

Many animals, including people, feel a instinctive sense of security in numbers. In the wild, the animal that strays from the pack is the most likely to be targeted by predators. That herding or pack instinct is very powerful, because it has been selected for over many millions of years of Darwinian evolution.

In many professions, it can be career-damaging to resist the pressure to conform. In my own long-ago profession as a news reporter, pack journalism was and is  the expected behavior. When I was with UPI in the 1960s and 1970s, the competition between AP and UPI was so intense that being first with a story, by 4 or 5 seconds, was all-important. The result was very sloppy journalism, and the dumbing down of news consumers.

And that trend of 40 years ago has only gotten worse, especially with the relentless pressure from the fake journalists at Fox News. When Fox makes up a story, even a typically bogus story, pack journalism kicks in and soon all the media, even the once-esteemed New York Times, are soon imitating Fox.

That herding tendency is true not just in journalism, but in other fields, especially medicine. When I once complained to a doctor that he wasn&#039;t paying attention to me, he adamantly insisted that it &quot;would be malpractice&quot; for him to listen to his patients instead of following national guidelines.

Self-experimentation may be the only way for most health consumers to find out what works for them. BigPharma certainly is not the solution.

Seth: I agree. This is one aspect of what I mean when I say non-professionals have more freedom than professionals. Non-professionals can test &quot;crazy&quot; ideas (e.g., &quot;crazy&quot; ideas about how to lose weight or sleep better), professionals cannot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find that Filemaker is a useful program for collecting data, for those of us unfamiliar with and intimidated by R. It is a database program that allows one to design one&#039;s tables, fields and forms. This is really what you need to collect personal data. 

For example, right now I&#039;m measuring sleep onsets and durations, and psychomotor test scores with subjective notes. Both have autogenerated timestamp fields. This is to provide feedback on a polyphasic sleep experiment.

In a single database, I can store pretty much every type of self tracking data I collect over my lifetime. Handy.

At a more zoomed out level, I track every day that I get to my journaling habit, which serves as a good proxy for conscientiousness and overall health. I use the website &quot;don&#039;t break the chain&quot; for this. 

I believe that the act of tracking should be designed so that in itself it increases your discipline without adding onerous load to your day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, after four months I&#039;m convinced your diet works:

http://johnlawrenceaspden.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/shangri-la-diet-month-four-success-im.html

I&#039;m still not convinced about the scarcity of food -&gt; loss of appetite theory. It looks like a just so story, and it could equally well go scarcity of food -&gt; eat everything you can get your hands on.

But I think your diet works for me. Is anyone showing any interest in doing a large scale randomized trial?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for your excellent blog post. No one has contacted me about doing a randomized trial, I&#039;m afraid. About the theory behind the diet. The theory came before the diet and led me to it. That a theory produces a diet that (a) works and (b) is very counter-intuitive seems to me to be excellent evidence for the theory. I too was/am skeptical of evolutionary explanations but they have helped me find surprising cause-effect relationships several times.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
