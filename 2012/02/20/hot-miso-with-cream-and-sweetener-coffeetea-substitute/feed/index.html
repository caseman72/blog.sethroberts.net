		<description><![CDATA[Tea is a fermented food. Why do you consider it to be unhealthy?

You can even find very strongly fermented teas, like &quot;puer,&quot; that contain myriad bacteria and related enzymes (one enzyme in puer has a strong ability to digest wheat gluten), and last many years, improving with age like fine wine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a cup of miso now and then in place of tea. When having it this way, I usually mix it with a little cocount oil.

For Alex: saltiness is one of the dominant flavors in miso, but there are variations that are less salty. To generalize a bit, if you prefer milder flavor, stick with shiromiso (&quot;white miso&quot;), which has a sweeter flavor, and avoid akamiso (&quot;red miso&quot;) which is often stronger-tasting and saltier. But since there are so many varieties; I guess this is a good time to try out side-by-side comparisons.

I prefer stronger flavored food, but just to put it out there, the brand I usually buy from my local Asian food market is called &quot;Yamabuki Milder Miso&quot;. It has much less sodium for some reason than the other brands, which is not that important to me, but it is also one of the more expensive brands that doesn&#039;t have added MSG or additional flavorings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, do you have any sense of what a dose-response curve would look like for ingestion of fermented food?  Also, is your miso fairly salty?  I may try your suggestion (miso with hot water, sweetener, and [soy] creamer), but I wonder about the saltiness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why do you use sucralose instead of sugar? My impression was that artificial sweeteners seem eventually shown to be less healthful than natural sweeteners (perhaps depending upon quantity, frequency, other dietary factors, and preexisting digestive &amp; physiological status, e.g. artificial sweeteners are probably less harmful to diabetics than natural sweeteners would be).]]></description>
