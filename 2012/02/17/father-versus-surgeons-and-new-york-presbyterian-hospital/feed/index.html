		<description><![CDATA[Check out this just posted article from WSJ on hernias and operations.

Hernia repair, one of the most common surgical procedures, carries a risk many patients don&#039;t consider: chronic pain after surgery.

More than 30% of patients may suffer from long-term chronic pain and restricted movement after surgery to fix a hernia, a bulge of the intestine or body fat through a weak area in the abdomen, studies show. Damage to nerves and muscles from the hernia may cause lingering discomfort. New synthetic mesh devices, though better than traditional sutures at reinforcing the abdominal wall, can irritate nerves and carry a slightly higher risk of infection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I asked in one of your recent posts about medicine:
&quot;Why am I not surprised?&quot;

What does surprise me is that so many people blindly trust the medical industry. Maybe it&#039;s partly because of all the &quot;gold standard&quot; research studies published in prestigious medical journals.

But the &quot;gold&quot; in the &quot;gold standard&quot; seems to refer to all the money involved, from the studies funded by drug companies, the reports published in journals that make huge sums of money selling reprints of those articles to BigPharma marketing departments, all the way down to the surgeons and drug-pushing doctors. 

As I&#039;ve discovered through repeated personal experiences, the medical industry isn&#039;t very interested in low-cost approaches like simple lifestyle changes, especially when hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made from tests, surgeries and drugs for each patient.

If you want to contain escalating medical costs, just shut down the entire health care industry for a year, and watch the sharp decline of prescription drug abuse deaths, of hospital-acquired infections, and of deaths from botched surgeries and drug prescribing errors.
