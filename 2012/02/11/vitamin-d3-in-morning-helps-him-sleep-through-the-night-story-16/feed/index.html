		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering if Greg Harrington took the negative feedback effect into account when he computed how much d-vitamin is created from 75-90minutes fullbody daylight. The body has a negative feedback system which cuts down d-vitamin production after some or enough has been produced. I&#039;ve once heard it said that it only takes 15 minutes sunlight to reach that limit for white people. I tried confirming this number by asking Google + Wikipedia, but none made we wiser. But the negative feedback system definitely exists.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Making vitamin D by exposing skin to sunlight creates a create negative feedback--the skin darkens and makes less vitamin D, so no one is getting 50000 units of vitamin D on a daily basis from sunlight. Wrong assumption, but good guess.  Complications of high vitamin D include abnormal bone formation, kidney stones and possibly brain function.
50,000 a week for 8-12 weeks is the medical regimen for true deficiency, then the replacement is based more on geographic latitude than anything else.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some recommend taking 50k once per week. IMO, if you&#039;re taking 3k or more per day get a blood test. Do some research and pick a target level, mine is 100 nmol/L (40 ng/ml), then retest to monitor progress. The units differ according to your location. In Canada our tests are in nmol/L in the USA it is usually ng/ml.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[50000 IU seems like way too much to take on a daily basis.  (I&#039;ve never seen anyone recommend more than 5K to 10K per day.)   I would recommend that this person get his blood levels checked and make sure they are not too high.  Otherwise serious complications could occur.]]></description>
