		<description><![CDATA[garymar, not sure if you&#039;ll see this, but the way to make transdermal magnesium ridiculously cheap is just to dissolve the magnesium chloride in water and apply it with a sponge while in an empty tub.  Read a book or email w/ your phone while it absorbs.

If the concentration is too strong, you&#039;ll feel a mild stinging sensation after about ten minutes (which stops immediately upon rinsing off.)

I just can&#039;t see the point in diluting it with a tub full of water each day and then losing it all down the drain.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, that&#039;s a great link. I just bought some Epsom salts, magnesium sulfate, to put in my bath (besides taking magnesium citrate orally). The magnesium chloride would be a lot cheaper. I can buy it here in Japan in bulk because it&#039;s used in the making of tofu (it&#039;s called nigari).  It costs about $30 for 50 lbs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It can be hard to get enough magnesium orally, as it&#039;s bulky, and ingesting too much can cause diarrhea (the &#039;milk of magnesia&#039; effect.)

Apparently, it is much more efficiently absorbed transdermally, via baths or soaking your feet in water to which magnesium chloride crystals have been added.

This is the stuff when marked up as a bath product:

But this is the same stuff from an aquarium supply store (about a third the price):
