		<description><![CDATA[just thinking some more about this, 
if you were going to experiment with a larger weekly dose; 
it would probably be better &amp; more interesting to start with a smaller &quot;big&quot; dose &amp; see how many nights the sleep benefit (assuming you saw a benefit) lasted.
ie. take 12,000 IU one morning &amp; monitor your sleep over subsequent nights.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The once per week dosing is very interesting. 
Makes me wonder what the minimal dose would be in this once-per-week dosing scenario.
Given that other posters (&amp; yourself i think?) have mentioned that smaller daily doses did not help sleep. ie. (from memory) 2000 IU not effective, 4000 IU effective.
I wonder if 28,000 IU once per week (7 x 4000) would have the same sleep benefits throughout the week as 4000 IU per day (all taken in the morning of course).]]></description>
