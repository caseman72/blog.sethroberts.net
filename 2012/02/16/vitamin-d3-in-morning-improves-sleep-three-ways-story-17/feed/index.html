		<description><![CDATA[@Chris Cappadocia:
Maybe it&#039;s time to get a Zeo to get better data on falling asleep and night awakenings?

@Nate W:
If one starts talking about improvement of sexual health the media types who want to report about Quantified Self will use it as the core example. It reduces the seriousness of the media reporting and people see self experimentation as &quot;fringe&quot;. Talking about improving sleep is much better for the self experimentation meme.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, why do you never write about sexual health - e.g., the effect of vitamin d on sexual health? Obviously, it&#039;s an aspect of health most people care about, do you not consider it important?]]></description>

This looks like a good description of the effect it has on me.
