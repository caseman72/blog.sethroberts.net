		<description><![CDATA[I really like Christopher Burd&#039;s suggestion of  “vernacularization”.

I also like the idea of a public skill set that changes and has things enter (and exit, say weaving or sewing) this way.  Having language to talk about the public skill set would be useful because I most often see people talking about how we have fewer public skills, when it seems that they just change over time and changing based on technology available is normal flow (eg high literacy)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When something that was done by everybody becomes the domain of professionals, it&#039;s called &quot;professionalization&quot; - and the opposite would be &quot;de-professionalization.&quot; This is similar to, for example, deschooling as Illich used it, which I like in this context.

		<description><![CDATA[I think that this process is simply the march of technology, and the growth of wealth in society. Over time, the total amount of valuable things grows, and stuff that was only available to royalty and billionaires eventually becomes ubiquitous.

Examples include automobiles (85% of households below poverty line have one, 35% have two cars), cell phones, computers, spices (black pepper was worth more than gold at one time), indoor plumbing, medicine (most common drugs are now $4 per bottle at Walmart), electronics (DVD players, navigation systems), etc.

As time passes, we find ways to make everything cheaper, and everyone can afford to do what specialists used to charge a premium for, basically because they had access to expensive equipment that regular people could not afford.

I think personal science is a different phenomenon. It&#039;s an act of dissension, taking matters into one&#039;s own hands instead of asking high-ranking men of science for approval, who have convinced most of us that large double-blind studies are the only way to differentiate causation from correlation. Most people are convinced that anecdotal evidence is worthless, and that the only way to know if a drug or treatment will work is to look to the leaders of the scientific community, in the same way that religious leaders in the middle ages convinced most that they were the only way to decide was is moral and what is not, and the only way to predict the future. In the past, they predicted armageddon; today they predict runaway man-made global warming that will kill us all. It&#039;s basically the same religious process.

So, in the future, I suspect that more and more of us will realize the nature of scientific religion, as it were, and begin to defect from its grip in ever greater numbers. Today huge percentages of Europeans are agnostic about God, and I suspect that many years from now most of the developed world will be pro-personal-science, and will largely discount the influence of the scientific-religious leaders of tomorrow. Many years from now we will realize that science is today controlling the lives of average people in the same way as medieval priests.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My contribution is &quot;vernacularization&quot;.

But I actually agree with Carl Willat. Just commandeer &quot;deprofessionalization&quot;. 

Linguistic patterns like &quot;de + X  + ization&quot; don&#039;t typically have precise meanings out of context, but people coin new instances because they need a term for some precise meaning. So, the established meaning of  &quot;deprofessionalization&quot; (= a shift in a job&#039;s requirements from a high to lower skill level [?]) occupies only one point in the field of potential meanings of that word. There is room for alternative meanings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Laity (and related terms as lay workers, laymen, laypersons, etc ) is widely used and understood in most Catholic and Protestant congregations.  I think it is much more widely used and understood than you might imagine or have experienced.  I think  “laificiation” is a good fit.  Some congregations have lay pastors or lay preachers - exactly the transition from specialist (priest or preacher) to &quot;something done by the general public, not as a job.&quot; that you are looking for.]]></description>

yes, that&#039;s very true. It does have a &quot;how dare you!&quot; (blasphemous) aspect, which other instances of deprofessionalization or whatever you call it -- such as digital photography -- do not.

To answer your question, all the examples I can think of came from new cheap technology.]]></description>
