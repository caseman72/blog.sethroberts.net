		<description><![CDATA[I do drink a lot of coffee, yes.  Two or three cups of strong coffee between 6:15-7:15am, and then another two or three (of far inferior quality) at work between 8-11am.  I don&#039;t usually drink coffee in the afternoon.  What&#039;s the half-life of caffeine in the bloodstream?  Around 5-6 hours, apparently, so maybe there&#039;s enough remaining to interrupt sleep.

Maybe I&#039;ll give up coffee for Lent one of these years and see what happens, but the fact remains that the insomnia comes and goes while my coffee consumption remains more or less constant.  And if I had to choose between coffee and getting a bit more sleep ... I might well choose the coffee, especially since the insomnia doesn&#039;t seem to be affecting my functioning this time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Murray,

I started taking Vitamin D with gelcaps (on sale), and had good results. (I always slept well, but seemed more alert during the day.) But then my frugality kicked in, and I bought the tablets from Walmart, probably similar to the London Drugs. They don&#039;t seem to have the same effect, so I wonder if active ingredient works as well. I will have to bite the bullet and try the gelcaps again. 

Regarding why &quot;this stretch is notably more tolerant&quot;, it could be that this new job situation is making the difference. I know I slept much better... :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also have terminal insomnia and also have found no effect on sleep from taking Vit D3 early in the morning.  In fact, I also feel my sleep might be a bit worse from it.  

I do wonder though if there is perhaps some genetic variability at work here.  My ancestors are from Northern Europe/Scandanavia.  If they lived  in that part of the world for many thousands of years wouldn&#039;t it be possible that they evolved a different way of handling Vit D, (perhaps  a need for less, a super efficient way of handling small amounts, a preference for D from a different source (fish liver) for example) from those ancestors who lived in warmer, sunnier climates over the same period, and who consequently didn&#039;t have a need to modify the way they handled Vitamin D.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have WEAK evidence that taking 4000 IU Vit D at 8am will cause me to wake spontaneously at 6am. I have no trouble going back to sleep.

The sample size is small and I conjecture that the dosage is insufficient because the Vit D is not making me tired.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...for which I get up at 6 am and (on most days) ride my bicycle about 12 km (7.5 mi) to work,...&quot;

High-intensity early morning exercise can cause people to wake up earlier than expected. I used to do heavy cardio first thing when I woke up but noticed I would wake up 1-2 hours earlier with my heart beating fast and I would not be able to fall back asleep. The problem went away when I stopped exercising early in the AM.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My own experience. 

I have irregularly taken 1000 UI in the morning for years with no noticeable effect.

For about two years, I have had poor sleeping patterns characterized mostly by the fact that I tend to go to bed at 1am or later (and then I get up around 7h15 am). Whenever I would try to go to bed earlier, I would simply fail to fall asleep.

After reading this blog, I increased my intake of D3 to 4-5,000 IU. I&#039;m now falling asleep about an hour earlier. This could be a placebo effect, of course, but I consider it a very significant improvement.

It is unclear whether I have more energy. I don&#039;t know how to measure such an effect. I expect that I&#039;m less irritable, but that&#039;s a side-effect of getting more sleep.

I plan to continue to see whether the effect is sustained over months.]]></description>
