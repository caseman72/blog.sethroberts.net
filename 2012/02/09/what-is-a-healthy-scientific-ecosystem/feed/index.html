		<description><![CDATA[Seth, for me this is a very profound and astute insight.  It is also expressive of what I think should be an ideal for real scientific discovery and progress.  

The caveat here, as I see it, is that the &quot;professional&quot; side of scientific study/ experimentation/inquiry must be done more honestly and not be influenced or corrupted by special interests and/or those with an axe to grind.  

All too often, it appears to me that the &quot;professionals&quot; are engaged in the opposite of true scientific method; i.e. the research/inquiry is not conducted with a focus of trying to disprove a hypothesis, but rather to seek a specific result for financial or other material gain.  (Have any of those guys ever heard of Karl Popper?)  I&#039;m sorry to say that pharma company research / drug development practices come to mind as one glaring example.  

So at this point I have to side with Jim P. on the virtue of N=1, but I certainly agree that professional science could (and should) be an invaluable aid to progress, but only if the corrupting incentives of $$ can be removed from the equation, or at least attenuated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;But “correlation does not equal causation” is a vital truth, the ignoring of which has led to two generation’s worth of drively health advice/instruction to the population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I disagree. I call &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot; a phony critique. It appears to be helpful but actually isn&#039;t because it ignores the complexity of specific cases (the extent to which a correlation implies a specific causation depends on the plausibility of alternative explanations -- about which no blanket statement is possible). I explain the poor health advice of recent decades as due to poor science -- the health scientists involved (e.g., the ones studying weight control) are unable to make progress. A large fraction of them do experiments -- e.g., the large clinical trials that &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot; advocates are fond of. The lack of progress provided by large clinical trials cannot be explained by a failure to understand that &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot;. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever I have to choose between a large expensive study and my own N=1 experiences, I will feel comfortable going with N=1.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Me too. But I am saying here that this choice -- deciding which is better -- doesn&#039;t do justice to the relationship. For example, people who do N=1 studies may be able to learn from large expensive studies. My first self-experimentation of any interest was a comparison of two Big Pharma treatments for acne. One worked, the other didn&#039;t. It was helpful to know that one worked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

You recently posted about someone who experienced breakouts and [Irish] dairy.  I think I have noticed this with Fage [full fat], but I have not tightly controlled my variables.  Have you had any comments like this before?  Would you suspect a difference between homemade yogurt (I like strained) and Fage?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Obviously, when different entities interact in an ecosystem, they co-evolve. 

However, these interactions are not always as benign as your portrayal. The players may be also be predators and prey, for example.

And in the case of individuals and BigScience (or BigMedicine, or BigPharma), they may be rivals, especially when the large institutions dismiss N=1 evidence as &quot;anecdotal.&quot;
