		<description><![CDATA[I have difficulties in falling asleep, I rarely wake up feeling refreshed and I often feel slightly exhausted during the day. I&#039;ve been taking vitamin D3 a couple of years now with doses ranging from 1000 to 6000 IU, but I don&#039;t remember ever noticing any effect of D3 on my energy levels or sleep. Before coming across Seth&#039;s writings about the timing of D3 I usually took my pill sometime in the evening (7 to 9 pm perhaps). Now I&#039;ve been taking my D3 in the morning, but I haven&#039;t noticed an effect. (In fact, I feel that my sleep might have been a bit worse, but if so, it&#039;s probably unrelated.)

A while ago I was still taking a shower and brushing my teeth before taking the D3 so that I could consume it with a spoonful of coconut oil. When that didn&#039;t seem to help, I started taking D3 before getting up from the bed - no effect.

I wouldn&#039;t be particularly surprised if D3 didn&#039;t have a noticeable effect on me - not many supplements do. If there&#039;s something that I could still try it might be increasing the dose. I&#039;m tall, I&#039;ve got at least a little muscle and my metabolism seems to be quick (I eat a lot and stay lean) so it&#039;s possible that I have a floor effect on my current dosage. I&#039;m a bit hesitant to increase the dosage though since I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d get some adverse effects, too.

I&#039;m planning to try taking D3 in the evening to see if it makes my sleep or energy levels worse. I&#039;ll probably go back to taking it in the morning since that&#039;s probably the best, but I&#039;m curious to see if my body responds to the timing of D3 in any way at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For the last 4 weeks, I&#039;ve been eating within 30min of waking up and taking 4000 IU D3 (Kirkland brand, just like Elizabeth from story #11) along with a multivitamin.  I am trying to get my body to wake up, rested and energetic, at 6:00 am everyday.  This regimen has not helped me wake up any easier.  In fact, this last week I&#039;ve had to skip eating breakfast in order to not be late for work.

I did take 10,000 IU of D3 one day.  I had a tremendous initial bust of energy.  I literally could not sit down for the next 3 hours.  But it was not any easier to get out of bed the next morning.

My number one desire right now is to improve my ability to get up early.  I had high hopes for the early breakfast/D3 combo.  I&#039;m pretty frustrated that it has not worked for me.  I&#039;m not sure what to try next.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suspect that those already replete with vit D will not see an effect. Anybody who is taking vit D should have their blood levels tested from time to time both to avoid toxicity (rare but possible) and to provide some insight to the dose required to achieve a target blood level. The folks at grassrootshealth have some good info on target levels and how to choose dosage.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth- I started taking D-3 4000 IU, this week. My sleep has definitely gotten much better. I typically have no problem falling asleep, but wake up at 12, 2 and 4. Last night I slept until 2:30 and overall feel like I&#039;m much more rested. One thing I have experienced which has not been mentioned is that my dreams are much more vivid, and I recall them more easily. 
Thanks for alerting me to this very interesting and useful nutritional idea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since you started posting these, I&#039;ve been taking D3 in the mornings and notice that I wake up much more easily. I started with just 400 IU, then increased to 800 IU. One day I took 1200 IU and woke up at 4:00 AM the next day. I&#039;ve gone back to 800 IU since 4:00 AM seems a bit early. For the past week, I&#039;ve also been giving one of my daughters (11 years old) 400 IU each morning, and she seems easier to wake up in the morning (normally it&#039;s quite difficult).

Sorry I&#039;m too lazy to keep detailed records. I&#039;m taking NOW Softgels. 

I do wonder if there would be an initial effect that goes away over time as  your body adjusts.]]></description>
