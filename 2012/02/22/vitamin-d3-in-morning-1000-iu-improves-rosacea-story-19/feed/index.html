		<description><![CDATA[Funny, I thought everyone knew that--but maybe not.

I developed rosacea about 10 years ago, after being sick with a mystery illness that kept me out of work for a month and taking massive antibiotics that, in the end, had nothing to do with getting me better. After that, I developed digestive problems and also a tendency for facial flushing. I noticed it first in pictures--I&#039;d be the person with the bright red nose.

I never got the bumps on my skin that some rosacea sufferers have, just flushing. It was aggravated by cold, caffeine, spicy foods, strong emotions, and alcohol. Also, sugar and wheat consumption seems to aggravate it generally--not cause an attack but make me more prone to them. I got laser treatment for it, which helped for a while, though it came back, as the doctor had said it would.

Anyway, a few years back I started taking D3 regularly, based on advice on paleo sites and this website, and I noticed that it had a dramatic affect on my flushing--even more than just avoiding my triggers. (That&#039;s hard anyway, since I love tea, coffee, and red wine.) I told a friend with rosacea, and he found that it worked too.

My D3 intake varies a lot, since sometimes I&#039;m very good about taking it regularly and sometimes I get out of the habit of taking it (like right now). I sometimes take cod liver oil, and sometimes D3 gelcaps. When I stop taking it, the flushing comes  back--I notice it after my morning coffee and after wine with dinner. When I start again, the flushing subsides. I&#039;ve never paid attention to how long it takes--like whether it&#039;s instant or whether I need to take it for a while to notice the effect. Perhaps I&#039;ll start taking it again and see what happens.]]></description>
