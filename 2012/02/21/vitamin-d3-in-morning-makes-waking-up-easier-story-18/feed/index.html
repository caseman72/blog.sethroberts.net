Thanks for the suggestions. To answer your question: Not regularly. I think I&#039;ve sampled most of them. Recently I confused White Collar and Suits so I watched a few seconds of White Collar.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And of course I was just joking about your supposed hoax.

Actually, I am fascinated by how often that you detect things that nobody else seems to have noticed before. It reminds me of how a young child (who still has an open mind, at least until TV kills their brain cells)) will often spot things that adults see every day but don&#039;t notice.

While I&#039;m in my full-blown &quot;TV-kills-the-brain&quot; mode, Seth, I&#039;m curious about how much TV you watch, and what kinds of TV you watch. As an ultra- liberal, I hope you tell me that you watch MSNBC and CNN, but you&#039;ll destroy my theory if you watch Fox News.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is the Shangri-La Diet &quot;ironic and absurd&quot;? I don&#039;t know what &quot;ironic&quot; means but yeah it does seem absurd. 1. Using sugar or fat (olive oil) to lose weight. 2. Making such a small change -- all other weight-loss diets involve big changes. 3. Adding foods to what you eat (all other weight-loss diets involve some sort of deprivation -- don&#039;t eat this or that). 4. Nose-clipping: why should that have any effect? The calories don&#039;t change, and calories are what matters. Or: the carbs don&#039;t change, and carbs are what matters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David Cramer said:
&quot;I found the irony and absurdity of the SLD appealing.&quot;

The absurdity of the Shangri-La Diet? Hmmm ... now there&#039;s an interesting thought.

David, maybe you&#039;ve discovered something. Maybe, all these years, the psychologist Seth Roberts has been running a psychology experiment on a grand scale, by proposing absurd stuff (sugar water to lose weight, balancing on one foot, staring at pictures of people in the morning), to see how many people can be fooled into doing ridiculous things.

Yup, any day now, Ol&#039; Seth will announce that his whole self-experimentation thing has been a big stunt funded by the propaganda gurus of Madison Avenue.

Seth Roberts = the new Allen Funt, with all of America as the unwitting stars of a new Candid Camera program.

Seth, does David Cramer get a prize for discovering your secret?

		<description><![CDATA[In the past, you discussed the effect of morning light--or its absence--on &quot;mood&quot; and such on &quot;normal&quot; individuals (as opposed to SAD types).  
Any idea if &quot;Daylight Savings Time&quot; has any deleterious effects?  I arise early every morning for a swim workout.  Right now, it is just barely dawn when practice is over in the outdoor pool, and soon Congress will make it dark again even at the end of the workout.  I am wondering if anyone has looked at the effect on mental health of screwing with the clocks to get us up in the dark?  Do you know?]]></description>
