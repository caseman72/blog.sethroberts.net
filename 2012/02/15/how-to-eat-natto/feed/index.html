		<description><![CDATA[I tried some natto this past week and it was not exactly what I had expected. It didn&#039;t smell totally horrific, but a wee bit off-putting. I mixed a bit in with some green onion and soy sauce and served it over rice for breakfast. Slimy, yes, but not bad tasting at all. I can&#039;t imagine eating a ton of it one sitting. But I think any taste can be acquired.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[3/3 of my friends so far, when asked (or not asked), never want me to microwave or even eat natto anywhere near them because of the smell.

Thanks for the raw egg tip; always on the lookout for more places to put those. Double bonus for supreme gross-out when others see me eating it like that. Wonder if I can somehow get the half stick of butter in there, too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Timely - I was wondering what to do with the natto in my freezer, since I rarely cook rice any more. I take it you are eating this &quot;straight,&quot; i.e. not over rice.

Why do you add a raw (rather than scrambled) egg?

Red onion or yellow/white onion?

As a complete aside, it&#039;s interesting that the styrofoam natto box does not feel cold to the touch even when straight out of the freezer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my experience, natto seems horrifically stinky. Maybe one gets used to what wikipedia calls the &quot;powerful smell&quot; with repeated exposure. I didn&#039;t mind the texture at all, but the smell seemed like ammonia, kind of hard to put up with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too found the texture of natto a problem at the start, I can barely taste anything from it except a faint hint of burnt coffee or something slightly bitter.

I always do a raw egg with natto, and usually just the yolk as I dont think it needs to be any slimier! Good tip on the onions though.]]></description>
