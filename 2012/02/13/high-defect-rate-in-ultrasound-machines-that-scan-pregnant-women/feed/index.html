		<description><![CDATA[Prenatal ultrasound may be hazardous for developing babies because ultrasound involves heat, sound and vibration, all or any of which can interfere with normal brain development.  During the prenatal period, the developing human is most vulnerable to any environmental insult, either chemical (pesticides, industrial chemicals) or physical (radiation, ultrasound). The use of prenatal ultrasound has increased dramatically over the past 30 years as has the prevalence of autism. Yet the focus of most research into causes of autism has been primarily genetics and chemical exposures.However, there is considerable research showing cause for concern and you can find abstracts of the studies at www.ultrasound-autism.org  You can also find Caroline Rodgers excellent powerpoint presentation The Elephant in the Room at http://iacc.hhs.gov/events/2010/full-committee-mtg-slides-Oct22.shtml 
Ultrasound may be safe for adults whose body systems are fully developed but it can severely affect developing babies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;In regards to dental x-rays, I believe people on the fence about them should look to another theme of this blog: hormesis. I, for one, am not too worried.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

yeah, I am not worried so long as the machine is working properly. If it is not working properly...



&lt;blockquote&gt;The ultrasound topic strikes me as altogether more sinister. Has anyone had experience taking a skeptical attitude to these tests? I imagine the pushback from the docs would be extreme.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Good question. I also wonder what happens if you take a skeptical attitude toward the machines themselves (&quot;when was the last time this machine was tested?&quot;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are dental x-rays really necessary? BTW, do you remember back in the 1950s when shoes stores had x-ray machines that let you see how well your feet fit in shoes? I think I would prefer that my feet get zapped for that sensible purpose instead of my head getting zapped.]]></description>
