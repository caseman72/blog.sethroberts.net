		<description><![CDATA[Climate scientists are &quot;stunned&quot; 
By TigerHawk at 2/08/2012 09:47:00 PM

Even though the warmists claim the science is &quot;settled,&quot; they keep getting surprised:

    The world&#039;s greatest snow-capped peaks, which run in a chain from the Himalayas to Tian Shan on the border of China and Kyrgyzstan, have lost no ice over the last decade, new research shows.

    The discovery has stunned scientists, who had believed that around 50bn tonnes of meltwater were being shed each year and not being replaced by new snowfall. 

Oops.

		<description><![CDATA[I still take only 2000 IU vit. D but I&#039;ve been taking it solo first thing in the morning and it&#039;s made a noticeable difference.  I have more energy and now rarely get sleepy mid-afternoon.  I also notice a big difference in &#039;tossing and
turning&#039; frequently during the night.  Next I&#039;m going to increase it to 3000 IU daily--at least for the remainder of the cool weather.  I live along the gulf coast so I get a lot more sun exposure during the rest of the year.]]></description>
