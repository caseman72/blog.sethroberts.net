		<description><![CDATA[About the time of day to take D3. 

Apparently the appropriate amount of UV-B in sunlight for D3 photosynthesis to happen is when the sun is at 40 degrees in the sky. Given that the earth rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours you calculate this for the equator:

40 / 360 * 24 * 60 = 160 minutes before and after noon. 

So, 2h40m before and after 12:00 is: between 9:20 and 14:40

Your skin has the appropriate metabolites replenished during the night, so most of the photosynthesis happens early on. So the most natural time to take D3 would be around 9:30.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;But I think more importantly, the quality of my sleep was not restful more often before D3 – I slept well (lightly, vivid dreams, woke up briefly, woke up feeling rested) maybe twice a week. I slept poorly (heavy, dark pit of sleep, no remembered dreams, unwilling to wake up and get up) 5 nights a week.&quot;

Question: Should we see dreams while sleeping, or is dreaming a marker of good sleep? Usually, I don&#039;t remember any dreams when I wake up but today I remembered two different dreams I saw during the night. Hmm...

I take vitamin D (5000IU) in the morning too, but usually 1 to 1.5 hours after waking (at breakfast).]]></description>
