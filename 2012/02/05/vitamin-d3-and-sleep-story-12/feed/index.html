		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;all good but also at least nod to the notion that this could be ascribed to a placebo effect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Right now I&#039;m trying to answer the question: Is there an effect? Does D3 in the morning make a difference? 

How to explain the effect -- if there is one -- comes later.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) every Fall and Winter that I can remember, though it&#039;s been more severe as I became a young adult and middle-aged adult.

I had been trying Vitamin D, in doses of 2000, 4000, and 5000, with very little, if any, effect.

This year I saw a new variety - D3 in 10,000. I figured I&#039;d try it...

And I am going to go down to 5000 again!

I&#039;ve definitely had more energy during the day, less sleepiness (though I&#039;m still tired during the day, if you see the difference between sleepiness and tiredness). But it&#039;s lasted too long, and pushed my bedtime back an hour and a half before I can really feel like falling asleep.


What I didn&#039;t think of was the delivery mode. I&#039;d been taking tablets of D3 before. This much higher dose isn&#039;t just a higher dose, it&#039;s a geltab filled with oil. It seems much, much more effective... too effective.

I&#039;m going to try the 5000 dose also in the same oil-filled gel tab and see if that&#039;s a better fit for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[all good but also at least nod to the notion that this could be ascribed to a placebo effect. its well documented that inceasing the dosage of a sugar pill,  e.g two pills rather than one, makes a placebo more effective. that&#039;s the problem with relying on anecdotes alone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Being coeliac, I am almost certainly depleted. Coeliacs don&#039;t absorb fat easily, even when they have apparently &#039;healed guts&#039;. I have have been gluten free for 6.5 years, and various other things &#039;healed&#039; at the 2 year point, but the nutritionist warned me that absorption can always remain problematical.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting posts on Vit D &amp; Sleep, Seth.  It would be nice to know optimal 25(OH)D levels and sleep...makes me wonder just how depleted, (or not), they folks are that have positive anecdotes.]]></description>
