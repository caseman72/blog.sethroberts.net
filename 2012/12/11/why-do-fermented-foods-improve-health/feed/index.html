		<description><![CDATA[Human contact in the morning -- or any other time -- irritates the snot out of me. But I love peace and quiet. I don&#039;t have a TV or a radio, and I keep the sound turned off on my computer.

You&#039;re the psychologist, Seth, but is there really anything wrong with enjoying peace and quiet?  If I&#039;m happy, what&#039;s wrong with that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We can add this to the list of &quot;evolutionary&quot; ways that modern living has
short changed human physiology. 

1. Industrial foods are unnatural. 
2. Artificial light disrupts circadian rhythms.
3. Artificial heat prevents cold adaptation.
4. Modern refrigeration restricts the need for food storage via fermentation.

Are there any I missed?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think you&#039;ve missed about a hundred. For example: 1. Modern living reduces human contact in the morning. 2. Modern timing of food interferes with sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really enjoy reading your stuff here on fermented foods. 

As for your theory about why bacteria is healthy for us, apropos point number 3, this sounds to me like exactly the same reasoning for the medical technique of fecal transplant http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2011/01/the_enema_of_your_enemy_is_your_friend.html]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Probably a half-baked theory, or at least you&#039;d need to check on a good sample of fat people.

Simple carbs aren&#039;t good for me, so I don&#039;t eat a lot of them. I like fat and protein more. I&#039;m still fat.

Your theory might apply to some proportion of fat people, but biology is complicated.

		<description><![CDATA[I have a half-baked theory that inadequate digestive flora leads to obesity: it makes foods with lots of white flour and sugar more palatable because they&#039;re easily digested by such people. Denser foods like meats with a lot of fat and high protein or raw fruits and vegetables don&#039;t digest so easily so they avoid them. Then they get addicted to the blood sugar spikes. No idea if this makes sense or not but there you are.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: As Nancy says, lots of people avoid carbs but are still fat. Alex Chernavsky tried a low-carb diet. Initially he lost a lot of weight. After a year or so he started to regain the lost weight. At that point he changed his diet. Short-term weight loss caused by his low-carb diet was not easily sustained for a long time. I don&#039;t agree that simply eating white flour and sugar is fattening (or avoiding them is thinning). It&#039;s more complicated than that.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
