		<description><![CDATA[I would be very interested to know what Frederick Hoelzel&#039;s diet and exercise routine was between the mid 1930s to the mid 1950 (age 45 to 65), because looking at his picture taken in 1955 at age 65, it&#039;s quite apparent that he is lean and muscular (he also appears to be small boned like myself) with very smooth skin - if you don&#039;t look at his head/face you would think he was in his 20s. 

Cheers]]></description>
