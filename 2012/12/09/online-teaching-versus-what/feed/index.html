		<description><![CDATA[Oh, last comment. One of the guys in my programming meetup group I started loves doing research (on electronics). It seems he is making little to no money. He open sources his findings.

My point? I think there is a lot of research going on out there. People love to tinker and learn. If they are passionate about what they learn then they want to share what they find out with others.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I went to school (electrical engineering - EE) with a guy that would skip the lectures (would attend for pop quizzes, etc., of course) and would copy his homework from other people. He had straight A&#039;s and was the president of the student IEEE. He would take 18 credit hours or more (unheard of for EE). How did he do it? He learned best by studying from the books. No need to attend lectures. Unfortunately, the system caused him to jump through hoops that only slowed him down from being productive and getting to work on a real job. I e-mailed him looking for work after losing my first job as a EE. He wasn&#039;t in the business of EE anymore, he followed the money and was a hedge fund worker, not sure what exactly he was doing.

My point is, people learn differently and the current one-way college trip is valuable only marginally. It seems because it is subsidized by the government to such a great extent that it has become much more valuable than it would otherwise be. Why is it valuable? Maybe because it acts as a screener for employers that shows the person is willing to stick with it for a long time?

I&#039;ve left EE also for computer programming. Rather than go through another 2-4 years to get a CS degree I&#039;m teaching myself. Books are great, stackoverflow is a great resource, programming themed blogs is great, creating an actual product while teaching myself is great, creating a meet up group in my area is great, connecting with other programmers is great. I think if I were to join a company and learn more closely with programmers would also be invaluable (something I will likely not do since I don&#039;t want to move and work regular office hours - 32 hour weeks is too nice).

My best resources for learning?
1) Doing the actual programming.
2) Reading programming books.
3) Reading code written by others.
4) Writing about my code that I have written.
5) Asking questions on forums about problems I run into.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Very revealing, thanks.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think online lecturing needs to be considered as only a single tool of online learning. I learn a lot online (as mentioned above, blogs are an important piece of that), but I have never WATCHED an online lecture. I can probably count on one hand the number of YouTube videos that I&#039;ve seen - it&#039;s just not my thing. On the other hand, my husband does most of his online learning (car repair, art techniques, languages, etc.) by watching videos. Hopefully, as MOOCs increase, the purveyors of learning will keep in mind that different students have different learning styles - and, of course, certain subjects work better in certain formats.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always had trouble paying attention in class, which had the fortunate side effect of giving me a lot of practice at teaching myself mathematics from textbooks.

That said, I actually recently tried Khan Academy because I wanted to review linear algebra (planning to teach myself group theory).  Before that, I thought the idea of online education was hokey BS for reasons similar to things you said above.  I was pleasantly surprised--there was an amazing sense of clarity.

But I think that it&#039;s for a fundamentally different reason than people think: &lt;b&gt;I was able to pause and rewind.&lt;/b&gt;  I could therefore skip through segments that weren&#039;t important and play others multiple times.  Also, it meant that if I spaced out or had to go to the bathroom, there was no problem.

And what makes this such a valuable supplement is that while many lecturers are far from perfect, there is something about watching someone giving a tutorial that&#039;s fundamentally different than reading a textbook.


As for what scheme will actually work, that&#039;s a great question.  I think the only straight answer I can give is that the education system as it is now is unsustainable, and when things break, we will hopefully see some serious creative destruction that leads to innovations about how people will be taught.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The Khan Academy makes much more sense to me. One reason is that elementary school teachers may have trouble with or dislike math and science -- at least, compared to Khan&#039;s teachers. Another reason is that everyone should learn to read, write, do arithmetic, and so on. A third reason is that Khan stuff frees teachers to give special attention to students who are having trouble mastering the material. That&#039;s not the case with MOOC&#039;s.

I do think there&#039;s something to be said for adding a personal element to learning. An emotional connection with the teacher. Which might happen much better with a video than a book. But I have never heard the advocates of on-line learning mention this much less say how it will happen.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Three Dozen Private-College Presidents Earned Over $1 Million in 2010&lt;/b&gt;

In 2010, the latest year for which data is available, the highest paid president, with $3,047,703 in total compensation, was Bob Kerrey of the New School in New York City. Mr. Kerrey, who left the job in December 2010, received a $1.2 million “retention bonus” and a payout of more than $620,000 in deferred compensation on top of his base salary of $602,593.

Among the 493 colleges with budgets greater than $50 million, the highest paid sitting president was Shirley Ann Jackson of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, at $2,340,441.

		<description><![CDATA[In scholarly conferences, the value of getting together lies not so much in the presentations, as in the kibitzing that goes on in the hallways in-between, and the lunches and dinners where people get together to talk.

The unstructured bits are very valuable, but there has to be a &lt;i&gt;structure&lt;/i&gt; to hang them on. Seth&#039;s students wouldn&#039;t have followed his informal recommendation to read a certain book if they weren&#039;t already interacting with him within a formal structure.  So it looks like you need both.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It wasn&#039;t an informal recommendation. It was a homework assignment. I can&#039;t imagine an online lecturer saying &quot;read any 60 pages and I won&#039;t test you on it&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t tried anything on Coursera, but I like the format of Udacity and Khan Academy. The lectures are much shorter, focused and digestible, and they have great software to make the experience interactive and reinforce what you learn. Typical lectures and lecture notes generally offer a lot less than the course book if you can stand to get through it. The benefit of uni is more in the coursework, exams, guidance from professors and the structure and motivation a course provides. I found it harder to make use of the MIT OpenCourseWare materials than go through a Udacity course.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was at Berkeley, John Searle (phlilosophy department, class was Speech Theory) was an impressive lecturer - he walked the stage like an actor, using a full dynamic vocal range. Different vocal accents, changes in pitch, changes in volume and body language and a full command of the material. 

Alan Dundes (folklore professor, class was &quot;Forms of Folklore&quot;) was just so fascinated by his subject matter that he made the students fascinated too.

Also, if you ever have the chance to see economist David Friedman lecture you should do so (I first saw him guest-lecturing at Stanford). He&#039;s more in the mold of Robin Hanson -  defending unusual positions them through interesting stories that make connections that wouldn&#039;t have occurred to the audience.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I once had dinner with Alan Dundes. Strangest dinner ever. In an hour, he told fifty jokes. Very enjoyable. Many years earlier, I had attended one of his classroom lectures. He was extremely funny -- again, nonstop jokes -- but the psychoanalytic theory that he used to explain them seemed worthless. This was the strange case, the only one I can think of, where the delivery was great and the content was poor.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It would be a coincidence if the link that can be most easily strengthened turned out to be the weakest link.&quot;

A truth that applies alnost everywhere.

I am following the internet Harvard Computer Science course and can share some observations. 

Some parts of the academic process scale up readily, like lectures and design of assignments. Others, like marking assignments, not so much. For me, most of the learning takes place when working on the assignments. The fact that it will be seen and marked helps me to focus on finishing. I expect the future will unbundle research from teaching undergraduates and there will be just a few, expert lecturers. There are other issues which come with eliminating the campus as where the students are - in particular cheating is going to be harder to police. It could be that learning and credentials get unbundled, so you learn online with Harvard, but to get a certificate you go to an office and take a paper and pencil test under controlled conditions - a bit like Gmat or US bar exam.

Seth: Thanks. &quot;For me, most of the learning takes place when working on the assignments.&quot; I agree. For me, there is little learning without doing. This is what I mean about an incomplete theory of higher education. How important is doing? If it is 100% or 95%, yet most courses (outside math, engineering, foreign languages, etc.) provide only a little, then we should be trying to increase doing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I read this, I could not help but consider that blog posts - such as this one - are akin to online lectures (&quot;micro-lectures&quot;, perhaps?), and that the explosion of blogs and blog readers exemplify the potential value of MOOC. At the same time, there is no doubt that blog quality and readership varies widely, suggesting that MOOC, for MOOC&#039;s sake, is a grossly naive concept.

Quality of content is paramount. Easy, free/inexpensive access to poor quality lectures cuts both ways: the customer, having little investment in acquiring the lecture, is likewise predisposed to promptly drop that lecture if its quality is in the least substandard. Just as a blog&#039;s readership can readily rise and fall with the quality of the posts.

This may ultimately improve online learning, as long as lessons are taken from successful online lectures and applied to new attempts. The question for me is whether the &quot;old dogs&quot; (the run-of-the-mill lecturers) have the willingness and/or capacity to change. My guess is that they generally do not.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I like the blog/lecture comparison. When I was in college, I tried to find good books about the subjects I wanted to learn about. A good book about genetics, for example. These were never textbooks. They were often histories of the subject (a series of stories) or memoirs (a series of emotional stories). Nowadays I might try to find a good blog on the subject. Lots of blog posts convey emotion.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

At the same time, there is no doubt that blog quality and readership varies widely, suggesting that MOOC, for MOOC&#8217;s sake, is a grossly naive concept.</p>
