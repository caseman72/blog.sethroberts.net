		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Counting the number of species inside us is like measuring the length of the coast of England.&quot;

There are different definitions for the term &quot;species&quot; throughout biology and the use of this word in reference to bacteria appears to be controversial. Apparently enough scientists think bacterial species don&#039;t exist that you can publish a peer-reviewed paper in 2012 called &quot;Bacterial species may exist, metagenomics reveal.&quot;

Carl Zimmer certainly knows this and has written about it, though I personally find the use of the term to be confusing to those of us who like to dig deeper.

I think it is possible that some scientists are using the term without due care, but good microbiology papers will be clear on what they mean by the word if they use it at all. It is sometimes defined with agonizing rigor.

Mostly I&#039;ve seen &quot;species&quot; used to refer to &quot;operational taxonomic units&quot; (OTUs), defined as a specified level of sequence similarity in a particular segment of genetic material (e.g. certain variable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA). The boundaries between OTUs depend on what level of sequence similarity you specify (in other words, the size of the ruler you are using to measure the coast of England). OTU classifications vary from one paper to another and can depend, for example, on which software is used to crunch the sequence data (see e.g. http://hmpdacc.org/HMQCP for the Human Microbiome Project).
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Good points. Even when the definition of &quot;species&quot; is made clear, there is still the problem of coverage. As you sample more and more exhaustively, the number of species will get larger and larger.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article. Just a quick correction: IBD is short for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which is a collective term for the two serious inflammatory bowel conditions - Crohn&#039;s disease and Ulcerative Colitis. This is not the same as irritable bowel.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the correction.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
