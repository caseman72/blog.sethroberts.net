		<description><![CDATA[It is dangerous to generalize. We would be far worse off without modern medicine.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, some parts of modern medicine unquestionably help, at least short-term. I have a harder time than you assessing the long-term effects, in particular the effects on innovation. For example, how have antibiotics influenced our understanding of disease?
&lt;/strong&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, that is not completely true. Some drug interactions are actually sought out because they will have additive effects. Taking 2 blood pressure drugs is technically a drug interaction because they both cause lowering of the blood pressure (duplication of therapeutic effect), but in many cases that is the point.

In HIV therapy, Ritonavir is used not as an antiviral drug, but because it inhibits the enzyme that breaks down other antiviral drugs, thereby &quot;boosting&quot; them.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;Drug interaction&quot; refers to changes in effectiveness or danger. Taking two blood pressure drugs at once does not reveal &quot;interaction&quot; unless their effects change. Sure, some drugs are specifically designed to make other drugs/surgery work better. Or reduce their side effects. The most common example is analgesics: Make surgery more bearable. They are exceptions to the rule, yes.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suspect this is an example of a general rule: ALL medicines and surgeries make ALL other medicines and surgeries more dangerous. If you take Drug A, Drug B becomes more dangerous.

The term &quot;drug interaction&quot; obscures the truth that the interactions are always bad.]]></description>
