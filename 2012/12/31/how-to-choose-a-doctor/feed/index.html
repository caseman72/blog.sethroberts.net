http://officialblog.yelp.com/2009/02/east-bay-express-story-starts-to-unravel.html

Matt: We also published a number of posts on our blog about how our filter works and why some businesses may have come to believe in a grand (but untrue) conspiracy theory. Some good ones are here:

http://officialblog.yelp.com/2010/03/additional-thoughts-on-last-weeks-lawsuit-or-how-a-conspiracy-theory-is-born-.html

As you can see, there have actually been some undercover investigations by the media and even some lawsuits brought making the same allegations; none of them found anything to substantiate the claims and the suits were dismissed with prejudice. The bottom line is, regardless of how much or how many businesses want to believe in an easily disproved conspiracy theory, it simply isn&#039;t true. That&#039;s why consumers trust Yelp and use it every day to connect with great local businesses. Which also happens to be our mission.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like we need an undercover investigation :) because the internet is full of stories like the one I heard from the business that warned me about Yelp reviews. You would think that my legitimate review that I placed on that organization&#039;s Yelp page wouldn&#039;t be filtered out, seeing that I&#039;m a unique IP address, etc. But the business absolutely predicted that any positive review that was placed would be filtered within a matter of days, and that this all started soon after he declined the ad payment. A quick internet search to back up my personal experience revealed that East Bay article as well as other stories.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(Disclosure: I work for Yelp.) Matt, your scenario is simply not true. Yelp&#039;s review filter, which works to help consumers in precisely the manner described in Seth&#039;s blog here, is applied equally to all business listed on Yelp, advertiser or not. There is no connection between how reviews are displayed on Yelp and advertising. As is described in numerous places on our website, Yelp advertisers pay to advertise (primarily local/search advertising, just like on the major search engines) and do not gain the ability to control the review content on their Yelp listing. Neither does Yelp penalize businesses that decline to advertise. The filter helps consumers trust and benefit from Yelp (as described here), which is why 84 million of them used our service on average last month.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. Did Yelp reply to the East Bay Express article? I read it when it was published and still remember it. I do not remember any rebuttal.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While this scenario may have proved to be the more accurate portrayal, Yelp is a crooked organization. Yelp&#039;s filtering &quot;algorithm&quot; goes something like this:
1. Business begins receivng Yelp reviews of varying rank.
2. Yelp contacts business, asking them to pay money to hide low ranked reviews.
3a. Business pays yelp: low ranked reviews are hidden.
3b. Business does not pay: Any positive review is filtered within a couple of days. 

Yelp claims that they filter when they suspect that the business solicits for positive reviews. While that is likely also true, the scenario I laid out, is also true.

		<description><![CDATA[Off topic, Seth, but thought you&#039;d be interested in this quote from the URL below:

&quot;Before Dr. Pringle started the study, a colleague suggested she was wasting her time: to prove that something doesn’t age would take far longer than the duration of a research grant, perhaps longer than a researcher’s career or even life. But she stood her ground.&quot;
