		<description><![CDATA[If medical errors are the #3 cause of death, then it it seems that the statistics on those errors, and the doctors/hospitals who made them, should be made public, continually (i.e. online)

Just like it is possible to find out how many cases a lawyer wins/loses, so too with the medical profession.  If it is measured *and* publicised, it will get managed.

The trick being to have an objective way of measuring the errors...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Jeff re: &quot;Skin in the game&quot;

Easy solution:  Just as the pilot loses his life along with the passenger&#039;s if he crashes, mandate that any surgeon who performs the wrong surgery must have the same surgery performed on themselves.  Not that amputating the wrong limb is common (AFAIK), but if the surgeon lost his arm too when he accidentally took little boy Tommy&#039;s, that&#039;d be quite the dis-incentive!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Taleb brings up the airplane example a lot in his writing. The pilot has as much to lose as you do if the plane goes down so it is in his interest to be vigilant. That is not to say that the doctor is unconcerned for your welfare as a patient but they simply do not have as much to lose as you do if something goes wrong with your treatment. Having &quot;skin in the game&quot; is a great motivator for attention to detail.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you are very ill/tired/worried, your ability to participate fruitfully may be limited.  Still, I wish I had participated more over the years whenever I was well enough to do so.  In recent years the probable best thing I did was veto the GP&#039;s recommendation to take statins, a decision made when I was none of ill/tired/worried.

I also now incline to the view that the patient is probably the only actor in the drama who will try to weigh up everything involved - or, at least, everything he (thinks he) understands.  The specialists are specialist, the GP can give you only  a fraction of his attention - it&#039;s up to you to, at the very least, ask some critical questions.]]></description>
