		<description><![CDATA[I was in hospital last week and took the opportunity to explain to a young cardiologist about Ancel Keys and his lies.  She&#039;d never heard this tale before, and, I suspect, didn&#039;t believe a word of it.  Worse, I&#039;ll bet my bottom dollar that she had no intention of googling around a bit to see what&#039;s what.

A different young registrar told me that he&#039;d had a look at the photos resulting from my angiogram a couple of years ago.  Not only was there no significant narrowing, he said, but there were no deposits at all.  Clean as a whistle.  Ah, said I wisely, it&#039;s my bacon and butter diet!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good to know. During a year when I ate lots of butter, my deposits decreased. Your experience supports my hope that it was cause and effect -- the butter decreased the deposits.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
