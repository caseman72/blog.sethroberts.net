		<description><![CDATA[The other value of quantified research and other sorts of self-experimentation is for people who are sufficiently non-standard that the usual methods aren&#039;t working for them, though perhaps that counts as a variant of the beginning of research.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s what I mean by quantified self being useful at the &quot;end of research&quot;. The end of research is the point at which research has found &quot;usual methods&quot; to solve a health problem. The usual methods work well for most people. To find out if they work for you, you need to measure yourself. If they do not work, you need to measure yourself to find something that does work. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
