		<description><![CDATA[There was no controlled experiment, but it wasn&#039;t a matter of people forgetting. You can say they were confused, but Lancaster and Lind were just as confused.

Several arctic expeditions got scurvy, despite lime juice. This wasn&#039;t an experiment, but it was very good evidence. Actually, there was even better evidence: there was no difference between people on the ship, with more juice, and those off.

The simple claim &quot;citrus cures scurvy&quot; is just not true. The biochemical situation is simple, but the food consequences are complicated. What if the British Navy had listened to Lind? They would have put lemon juice in his copper vats and found no effect on scurvy. Would we today know they had tried? We remember Lancaster and Lind because their experiments matched the slogan &quot;citrus cures scurvy,&quot; not because they were the only experiments, let alone the only claims of data.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/211/4485/881.short&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;An alternative link for the Frederick Mosteller paper&lt;/a&gt;

The paper Darrin and Gwern cite suggests that it isn&#039;t so simple as saying &quot;lemons cure scurvy.&quot; What happened between Lancaster and Lind? It is not hard to imagine that people did experiments, and rejected citrus. It does seem, though, that they should have done enough to get the right answer.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think the paper they cite says that people forgot that lemons cure scurvy. Or were confused. Not that any experiment rejected citrus.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, Seth, I&#039;m having trouble understanding what you mean about the sailors: &quot;The sailors at risk of scurvy did not control what they ate. The people who controlled what they ate never got scurvy.&quot; Do you mean that the cooks on the ship always made sure that they ate lemon juice, but they didn&#039;t build it into the menu for the rest of their shipmates? How do you know this?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: What the sailors ate was determined by the food they took on board at the beginning of their trip. This was not determined by the cooks, as far as I can tell from the books I have read about this. It was determined by higher authorities.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
