		<description><![CDATA[Seth, a recent review (http://v.gd/yCy0FS) has found that: &quot;The available trials showed no benefit of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on cognitive function in cognitively healthy older people. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation is generally well tolerated with the most commonly reported side-effect being mild gastrointestinal problems.&quot;

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the link. I think time will eventually show that the cognitive tests used were insensitive.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Come to think of it I remember being in a till queue in Sainsbury&#039;s a couple of years ago and an American behind me being astonished that I was buying goats milk.  He seemed to think that v exotic, but our big supermarkets stock goats milk (full fat, skimmed, semi-skimmed) goats butter, yoghurt....

Tesco is our biggest supermarket chain: you might care to google to see whether they stock stuff that interests you.  Their delivery service is very good, though perhaps not to Beijing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[P.S. That link shows that it&#039;s stocked at ASDA, the British branch of Walmart.

Maybe our supermarkets just stock a wider range of stuff than yours or, at least, a different range.  I remember a few years ago an American blog speculating on the identity of an exotic fruit photographed at a store in Latin America somewhere.  It was a lychee, which we wouldn&#039;t consider unusual at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yakult is widely available and widely advertised in Britain.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Any idea why? For instance, who buys it? Why do they buy it? I haven&#039;t seen it for sale anywhere in Berkeley, including Whole Foods, which has about 8 brands of kombucha. I have never seen it advertised. It is for sale in Asian markets near Berkeley&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
