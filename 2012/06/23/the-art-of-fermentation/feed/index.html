		<description><![CDATA[Incidentally, if you are going to try to home-brew beer, I suggest starting with an actual homebrewing guide, not a chapter of a larger book on fermentation.  Brewers are doing lots of interesting stuff, e.g. this:

http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2012/06/100-lactobacillus-berliner-weisse.html

In general there is a large, thriving community experimenting with beer (and mead and wine), and people who are operating outside that community tend not to be up-to-date and to make a lot of rookie mistakes.  E.g.:

http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2011/10/booze-for-free-book-review.html

Many homebrewers, myself included, think that John Palmer&#039;s &lt;i&gt;How to Brew&lt;/i&gt; is the best starting place:

http://www.howtobrew.com/

(The website is free, the book is more extensive and is probably worth buying.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Chuck&#039;s point is probably that you can imagine different ways for something to get sour:  (A) It is sour because it contains bacteria that are producing some kind of acid (lactic, acetic).  (B) It is sour because it contains a product that itself contains/contained bacteria that produced some kind of acid (e.g. vinegar, yogurt).  (C) It is sour because someone simply added a bunch of acid (lactic, acetic, citric).

(A) obviously counts as a fermented food.

(B) depends a little on why fermented food is healthy, but it could be considered a fermented food to the extent it contains the relevant stuff.  Some vinegar is distilled, some isn&#039;t.  Maybe non-distilled vinegar has good stuff from the aceto bugs.

(C) probably doesn&#039;t count as fermented food.  And distilled white vinegar is basically (C), it is hard to imagine that it contains any bacteria cells or even bacteria by-products (other than the acetic acid itself).

So if you make pickles by soaking cucumbers in room-temperature distilled white vinegar, you may not be getting any real benefit beyond flavor.  I suppose there are probably a few bacteria in there, but it&#039;s hard to imagine they are numerous/active enough to provide real benefit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sonoma Brinery Outrageous Bread and Butter pickles are Outrageous too. My daughter has a friend who is a chef and says they&#039;re the best pickles he&#039;s ever eaten. 

Do pickles in vinegar count as fermented food?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: that&#039;s good to know about the Bread and Butter pickles, which I haven&#039;t tried. I like to think that sour pickles count as fermented food. They&#039;re aged at room temperature.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to get the book because I&#039;ve become very fascinated with fermentation - made yogurt a few years ago using a heating pad for a constant heat source. The first pad was new, however it would automatically shut off to keep from burning the user - obviously that didn&#039;t work. Got an old style pad from a neighbor who had two - it worked great, yogurt turned out great, burnt out the heating pad on the second batch - haven&#039;t made yogurt since.

I like sauerkraut (Bubbie&#039;s), but get a little bored with it - my 93 yr old, Swiss heritage, Kansas farm girl mom says it tastes just like her mom&#039;s. They kept it in a crock in the cellar. 

Found Sonoma Brinery barrel fermented Kosher pickles at WF - really good (most Koshers have too much garlic for my taste - not these - they even have little red chillies floating in the container with them). 

Really like kombucha (would really like to know how to pronounce that correctly) - but find it sometimes gives me stomach problems - a little heartburn - could be the carbonation - any ideas? I only drink the &quot;original&quot; flavor, so it&#039;s not any added ingredients. 

Have you posted your fermentation recipes? If not, would you? 

Cheers

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I too like Sonoma Brinery products, the kosher pickles and the &quot;raw sauerkraut&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
