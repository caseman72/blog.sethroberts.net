		<description><![CDATA[If you ask a TCM physician about prevention steps to improve the immune system,  I suspect you will hear about food therapy, supplements, Qigong, acupuncture, and meditation.  You may also hear about unfamiliar concepts such as Yin or Yang deficiency (and many more).  I am slogging through a book about Chinese healing, but the concepts are so foreign that not much is making sense.   

I have never been to a TCM physician so I have no idea what you might hear. 

I have an economic perspective on whether TCM is valid, in that those medical technologies which do not succeed at treating problems eventually fade away due to lack of customers.  TCM appears to be practiced in the Bay Area and is thriving in China.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Kirk

It would be even more interesting if the TCM practitioners actually had data showing their treatments could increase immune function.

Also, competent TCM Doctor is a bit of an oxymoron when there is no evidence supporting TCM being, oh I don&#039;t know, effective against disease.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You appear unaware of evidence that the immune system is effective against disease (&quot;you have no evidence that if our immune systems were much stronger, we would need to use antibiotics much less&quot;).&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh boy...

1. Yes better sleep does seem to lead to better immune function.  Good thing no one in the medical community studies that.  Oh wait, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21835655
Also, hospitals don&#039;t wake patients up solely to disturb their sleep, usually it is to get rounding/pre-rounding out of the way so the doctors can see and treat more patients.  If you ran a hospital where you could never disturb the patients, you would get very little done.

2. That is a tragic story.  However, if it was transplant rejection, and immunosuppressive therapy wasn&#039;t initiated there would have been a guaranteed organ rejection and death.  That&#039;s the thing about medicine, you actually have to make hard choices with real consequences.  Transplant rejection and an infection can manifest very similarly, and the life of your patient hangs in the balance. Then you have to own up to your mistakes.  Very much unlike watching from the stands and having 20/20 hindsight as you criticize from a blog.  Its not like they gave immunosuppressive therapy for no reason.  They knew it had risks.

3. Thanks for that anecdote from talking to one medical student.  Did you by chance ask her if sleep deprivation effected the immune system, or just listen to her list variables from a course she took and see if she missed your favorite variable sleep?  I would bet that if you directly asked her about sleep deprivation, she would have told you it was not good for the immune system.  Either way, one medical student at one medical school is hardly damning evidence.  My friend, who will be a medical student next year, knew that before taking a course on the immune system.  Of course her evil medical education will probably beat that knowledge out of her and teach her how to give advice that makes people sicker (/sarcasm).

4. Please, less citing of blogs and more citing of studies.  Oh and btw, the study you did cite said this &quot;PPIs have REVOLUTIONIZED the management and complications of acid-related disorders with a HIGH MARGIN OF SAFETY; however, with the data available, efforts to reduce the dosing of or discontinue the use of PPIs must be reassessed frequently.&quot; (emphasis mine)

It does not call for the end of PPIs, only that they be used responsibly in the treatment of acid related disorders with this new data in mind.  But hey, you do a great job of quoting out of context.
Oh would you look at that, evidence based medicine changing practices to improve patient care!  But I thought the doctors didn&#039;t care about making people better!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: What does &quot;HIGH MARGIN OF SAFETY&quot; mean? I have no idea. &quot;High margin&quot; compared to what?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that our problem is not a weakened immune system, but rather an overactive immune system.  there is an epidemic of autoimmune diseases happening, whether it is type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, eczema or lupus.  my recent experiences demonstrate this.

my daughter was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).  T1DM is a disease in which the body&#039;s immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.  the endocrinologist who diagnosed my daughter said that there is a big increase in T1DM, especially in the northern latitudes.  He posited that it may be due to lack of sunlight, much like MS.

I suffer from eczema, which is also on the increase and is also an autoimmune disorder.  

Just some observations.  Thank you--Susan]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, it would be interesting if you could use your contacts to find a competent Traditional Chinese Medicine physician to interview about whether that system considers it important to improve the immune system.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good idea. I think a lot of Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs do just that -- stimulate the immune system. But what about prevention? &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Patti,

First, my apologies for the tone of my previous reply.

I still do not understand why using &#039;immune system&#039; is inappropriate.  A search of PubMed for titles which include &#039;immune system yields 6815 titles.  I briefly browsed several papers to learn the authors worked in departments such as  Medicine and Immunology.

(The search string at PubMed is: immune system[Title] )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, here&#039;s an example of the widespread belief that suppressing the immune system is harmless. The immune system is involved in the local inflammatory response post-injury. One might imagine that this has something to do with the healing process (though I have no idea what the medical textbooks say about this).

It has been known for many years that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which suppress inflammation, may also impair healing, particularly of bone and cartilege (see e.g. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15177303 from 8 years ago). Many years later, human data on this subject is still lacking (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20487623), while perscription of NSAIDs apparently remains standard of care for orthopedic injuries. My friend was recently perscribed one for a sprain, and I asked a doctor I knew why. He agreed that they could slow the healing process, and that they were only perscribed for pain relief (my friend had no pain, and was not given this information by the perscribing doctor).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kirk, 

Yes those are all great websites for the general public.  

My point was directed at a medical professional not you, but since you have responded I shall make this comment just for you.  

There is no such thing as an Immune System.  Cells/tissues of the Lymphatic System make up immunity.  If you look at an actual college level Anatomy and Physiology textbook you will be able to read that there is no such thing as an Immune System.  There are eleven systems in the body, not twelve.  Maybe someday they will subdivide the Lymphatic System into two systems, but that is not how it is today. 

Suggestion for you - maybe you should consider getting your information from actual fact based text books instead of web pages?  Just saying...

		<description><![CDATA[@Patti,

Thank you so much for educating us.  While you are at it, you should send a blistering letter off to the Mayo Clinic, because they have a web page titled, &#039;Your Immune System.&#039;

Also send a nasty snarky letter of correction to WebMD, because they have a web page with the subtitle, &#039;Using Your Immune System to Stay Well&#039;.

And be sure to lecture the Cleveland Clinic, given that they have a web page saying, &#039;The human body has a highly efficient immune system, providing multiple defenses to ward off invaders such as bacteria, viruses and harmful chemicals.&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s be clear, there is no such thing as an Immune System in the human body.  There are eleven systems in the body and not one of them is called the Immune System.  The body has the Lymphatic System which includes organs that develop cells devoted to immunity.  Geez I learned this the first week of Anatomy and Physiology, you would think a doctor would know better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I commented on your last post on vitamin D how I haven&#039;t had any colds since I&#039;ve been taking 5k IUs and getting plenty of sun exposure. I also stopped taking Prilosec (a proton pump inhibitor) at about the same time. Interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there are too many confounding factors in the cold wet feet study to give it much credence. Number one on the list is exposure to the virus - past or present - dormant or active.

A better test, but by no means conclusive, would be to set up the test as they did and then expose everyone to the virus. Then see who comes down with a cold and who doesn&#039;t.  Still too many confounders though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also getting your feet cold and wet decreases immune resistance: http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Health/20051114/cold_warm_nose_051114/
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: A very interesting study, thanks. It deserved a lot more publicity than it got. I had guessed people get more sick during the winter because their sleep is worse.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
