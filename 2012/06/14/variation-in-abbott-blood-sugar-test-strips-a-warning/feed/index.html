		<description><![CDATA[I bought a digital fever thermometer a few years ago.  The first time I had to use it, I measured my temperature about five or six times in a row.  I was appalled by the variability in the readings -- they differed by as much as a degree.  I&#039;d prefer to use one of those old-fashioned mercury thermometers, but I think that they&#039;re not available anymore.  Maybe I could get a used one from eBay.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am using a Reli On meter that uses strips by Abbott that take a larger amount of blood, and they too suffer from this effect - and it starts happening before they expire. These strips are individually wrapped.   I originally noticed this problem with my original meter (that came from Target) that used strips in a bottle, so I switched to a meter that used individually wrapped strips.  It still happens, just more slowly.  By the end of the pre-expiration period, they are 10-15 points higher.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s one of the Miracles of Modern Medicine that no test reading ever comes with a plus-or-minus interval attached.  To ask them also to record potential bias is therefore a hopeless cause.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t mind the absence of a plus-or-minus interval. I can figure that out myself by doing repeat tests. I cannot figure out bias and 15 points is really bad.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
