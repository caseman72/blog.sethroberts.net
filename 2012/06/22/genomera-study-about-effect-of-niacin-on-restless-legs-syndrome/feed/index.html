		<description><![CDATA[Some research suggests that low ferritin levels are a secondary cause of RLS. When I read this, and was aware of my own low ferritin levels, I upped by Iron supplementation...no more RLS!

		<description><![CDATA[Seth

I had RLS for many years. I discovered through time that inflammation was the primary cause of my discomfort.

A new study was published in the January 14, 2012 issue of &quot;Sleep Medicine Review Journal&quot; that supports my theory:

The following website has evidence based on scientific studies that the vitamins/supplements that people have claimed has made their RLS less irritating all have anti-inflammatory qualities, including niacin.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; I find carb intake is best between 50-75 grams of carbs a day. Less than that, I get jittery from being in ketosis&lt;/i&gt;

You might test supplementing with inositol:

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The “medium” dose may generally be more effective, than both the “low” and “high” doses, in eliminating symptoms of RLS and avoiding side effects of niacin.

Why this might be true isn’t explained.&quot;

Paul Jaminet in his book, Perfect Health Diet, talks about the concept of plateau ranges for nutrients.  For zero up to a certain level, a nutrient is of increasing benefit.  Then there is a plateau range of maximum benefit for a nutrient.  Then intake over that amount causes a decrease in benefit and finally, excessive nutrient intake is harmful.

In my own case, I find carb intake is best between 50-75 grams of carbs a day.  Less than that, I get jittery from being in ketosis.  More than that, I get acne.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that niacinamide is generally safer, because it doesn&#039;t have the &quot;niacin flush&quot; effect. Niacinamide lowers stress hormones by lowering free fatty acids; I usually take 500mg once or twice a day and it makes me feel calmer. I guess it might work for RLS as well.]]></description>
