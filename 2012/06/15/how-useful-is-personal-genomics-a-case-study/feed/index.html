The standard medication, Synthroid, did nothing to change this, or the other symptoms. I finally found a doctor who would listen to me instead of just taking a TSH test, and I started taking compounded T3 only. Every symptom improved, including temperature. Many people, especially women, are subclinical hypothyroid. TSH test alone does not find this. (Subclinical really means TSH alone does not find hypothyroidism) The doctor should also test Total T4, Free T4, Total T3 and Free T3.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This appears relevant to the discussion: http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/NEJM.pdf

NEJM 
Whole-Genome Analysis 
In their article on a whole genome scan looking for SNPs associated with sporadic ALS, 
Dunckley et al. (NEJM August 3 2007 issue)
1
 consider finding ten SNPs that replicate 
over three studies unusual, based on unadjusted p-values of &lt;0.05 in each study. We 
question the non-randomness of the result as presented, as it recalls the following 
“mysterious letter” effect 
2
. In study one with 766,995 SNPs, one expects ~38,350 SNPs 
to meet the criterion by chance; 5% of that gives ~1,917 SNPs; 5% of that gives ~95 SNP 
expected to replicate over the three studies; the authors report ten. A major assertion is a 
Bonferroni adjusted p-value for marker FLJ10986 less than 0.05 in the first study. 
Computation of a Bonferroni p-value is the simple multiplication of the unadjusted pvalue,1.8x10
-5
, by the number of tests under consideration, 766,995, which, being greater 
than 1, is taken to be not significant.  We are skeptical that any of the claims (See Figure 
1) would replicate and the biological conclusions could be ex-post explanations to what 
appear to be random data

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, this is what I mean when I say the scientists involved seem to have no idea how to handle the false positive problem produced by doing so many tests.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

I definitely noticed a huge difference between non-organic coffee and organic coffee.  Regular coffee generates muscle knots in my upper back.

		<description><![CDATA[@Tom,

In the past few years I talked with two women (at separate times) who each said she wanted to move to a colder climate.  Each woman was overweight, comfortable with her size, and was eating high-carbohydrate foods during the conversation.  

In terms of my own experience, I have felt excessively cold during several periods in the past ten years.  The first was when I was trialing a low-carb way of eating.  The second was when I attempted 16-hour true fasts.  

Based upon my experience, my conclusion is that the women you noticed were in the midst of a restricted-calorie, low-carbohydrate, or intermittent-fasting regime.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Seth: As a way of defending body fat. It is clearly more difficult for women to lose weight than for men to lose weight. Perhaps the evolutionary reason is to give women a greater chance of surviving a famine.&lt;/i&gt;

Interesting, and makes sense.  I understand that, compared to men, women store a higher percentage of Omega 3 fatty acids (vis a vis Omega 6 fats), enabling them to continue to supply the developing fetal brain should food supplies falter during pregnancy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,
Risk factors for AMD are indeed well established from epidemiological studies, but for the personal component you would have to know family history, and not everyone does. If McCauley&#039;s  parents died young, for example, their genetic tendency for AMD wouldn&#039;t have been expressed and he wouldn&#039;t know he&#039;s at risk. In such circumstances, having the genome info would be helpful, since some preventive measures, such as not smoking, can prevent or slow AMD. Solid research shows that the main candidate gene for AMD is HF1. Assuming that 23andme tested accurately for SNPs of HF1, McCauley&#039;s increased risk is highly likely. In addition to not smoking, he should consider taking ocular supplements. The AREDS study showed that taking high levels of antioxidant vitamins (C, E, beta carotene) and zinc could reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD by about 25%. The AREDS II study, which is expected to end in 2013, adds fish oil, lutein, and zeaxanthin to the formula.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You write: &quot;Assuming that 23andme tested accurately for SNPs of HF1, McCauley’s increased risk is highly likely.&quot; I&#039;m less sure. In the genome-wide association studies that found the association that 23andme relies on, a huge number of tests were done, looking for gene/disease associations. I have yet to read anything that convinces me that the researchers involved understand how to correct for the number of tests done. That leaves replication as the only test of accuracy and these gene/disease associations often don&#039;t replicate. I believe the 23andme statement about increased risk could easily be wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Off-topic, but any idea why women are feel cold when most males are comfortable?

I&#039;m sitting in a Starbucks in a short-sleeved shirt and the AC just switched on, and as a result I&#039;m finally getting comfortable.  Yet I noticed that every woman near me has just put on a sweater.

It doesn&#039;t make sense to me that the genders have always been this way.  Any idea what might have changed in the modern environment to create this discrepancy?
