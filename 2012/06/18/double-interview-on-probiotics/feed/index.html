		<description><![CDATA[Okay, I don&#039;t know how much of a difference is the &quot;supplement factor&quot; [vs natural food], but to me, the idea of beneficial effects of certain diverse bacterium is beyond the need for a trial like this.  It simply makes sense according to all the physiological evidence we have, and these large-scale trials are too easily corrupted to tease out much useful information.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: My guess is that there are lots of things that can go wrong -- lots of of ways taking probiotics that don&#039;t work. You need the right dose, you need enough diversity, maybe the bacteria can die. Or don&#039;t work optimally. For example, is taking two probiotics better than taking one? Until you can measure the benefits you can&#039;t answer questions like that.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
