		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not seeing the cause and effect between having kids-&gt;better immune system.  Couldn&#039;t a simpler explanation be that healthy people are more likely to have children than non-healthy people?  They may have been healthier than the non-parents even before their children were born.  Unhealthy people are probably more likely to have lower fecundity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been following your blog for some time now and have at last made an observation on myself.  I much prefer (= am made happy by) showering in daylight rather than artificial light.  Perhaps everyone else knew this already, but I didn&#039;t.   It will constrain me a bit it winter, but so be it.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: How long does the improvement (greater happiness due to showering in daylight) last?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
