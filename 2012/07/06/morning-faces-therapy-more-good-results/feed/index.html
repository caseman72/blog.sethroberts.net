		<description><![CDATA[Jim, my living conditions are very similar to yours—I also lack TVs and radios, and proudly so.  (I don&#039;t get my &quot;news&quot; from anywhere, since I follow a &lt;a href=&quot;http://changethis.com/manifesto/show/34.04.LowInfo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;low information diet&lt;/A&gt;.) My point was simply that it would be very boring to do nothing but watch silent videos of faces for 20-40 minutes.  I hope Seth&#039;s correspondent can elaborate on his strategies to avoid boredom.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The recent comments above by Pablo Stafforin, Seth, and BlueMorrissey are fascinating to me, because I feel just the opposite.

I gave away all my TVs and radios back in 2005, and I thoroughly enjoy the peace and quiet -- no faces, no noise, and my apartment is almost soundproof, so I seldom hear the neighbors. And I get really annoyed when I go to a website and it immediately starts automatically making some noise.

Without radio, TV, or newspaper subscriptions, I get all my new from the internet, especially New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Google News, and Yahoo News.

For fiction, I watch all those shameless lying fake journalists on Rupert Murdoch&#039;s Fox &quot;News.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As i&#039;ve stated before, I watch Squawk on the Street on MSNBC in the morning for 30-60 minutes for my morning faces.  I don&#039;t know how people look at only faces or their own face.  I need a little entertainment.  I also watch Red Eye which I dvr the night before on Fox News.  It has faces and some witty comedy which puts me in an even better mood.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I understand your correspondent&#039;s message correctly, he watches muted news videos for 20-40 minutes each day.  Lacking any sound, such videos would be unbearably boring for nearly every person--however attractive the news reporter might be.  Am I missing anything here?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It&#039;s a good question how Navanit keeps from being bored. I&#039;ve asked him. I listen to podcasts, lectures, audiobooks, etc., while looking at the faces.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, when I read your blog, sometimes I think that I&#039;m reading some amazing Nobel Prize-worthy science.

But other times, I think I&#039;m reading a hilarious spoof from The Onion.

The problem is, I never know which is which.

This post inspires me to look into trying morning faces again;  the difficulty of finding the faces sources and the time investment put me off it.  So many ideas to try.]]></description>
