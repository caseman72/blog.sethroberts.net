		<description><![CDATA[I ate at Quanjude -- it was great! I still have the card giving the number of my duck.  It was like 80 million or something.

Japan has 12 Dintaifung restaurants, with 7 in the Tokyo area.  I&#039;ll try it out. Two of them in Shinjuku alone. 

Are they all bad? Probably because it&#039;s &quot;Chinese adapted to Japanese tastes&quot; Chinese food, unlike &quot;Chinese adapted to American tastes&quot; in LA.]]></description>

The two in Tokyo are terrible, but I&#039;ve been to the original in Taipei and few other branches in China/Taiwan and they are much better. So juicy. Best dumplings I have had.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You must visit the Hutongs!  Especially long confusing walks in the hutongs that end up at Ho Hai.

Once you are finished with Old Beijing (the Hutongs), go to modern Beijing (shopping malls, of course).  I recommend Raffles.

Take a 1-2 day trip to Chuandixia (to the West of Beijing).  This is one of my favorite spots in China!

If you do want to go to the Great Wall, stay overnight at Shaan Ba (in English- Mountain Bar).  I agree that visiting the wall can be annoying, but for most people it will be a must see.]]></description>
