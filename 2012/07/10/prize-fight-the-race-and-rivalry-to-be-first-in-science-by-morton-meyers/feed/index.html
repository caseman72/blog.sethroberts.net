		<description><![CDATA[WKPD: &quot;Originally, the discovery of streptomycin was credited only to Schatz&#039;s supervisor, Selman Waksman, who would later receive a Nobel Prize in 1952 for this work. Schatz, however, strongly contested the crediting and in 1950 brought litigation against Waksman, requesting recognition as streptomycin&#039;s co-discoverer and a portion of streptomycin royalties. Schatz&#039;s requests were eventually granted in an out-of-court settlement.&quot;  So why didn&#039;t the Nobel Committee then aware a prize to Schatz?  (i) Cowardice?  (ii) Vested interest of professors not happy with recognising research students as contenders for the prize?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: the Nobel Prize was given for work that &quot;led to the discovery of streptomycin&quot; not for the discovery itself.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It wasn&#039;t until I read his WKPD entry some time ago that I learnt that the attribution of the transistor to Shockley was somewhat polluted.

 Much more was made of the point that &quot;Shockley&#039;s field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in 1930 by Julius Lilienfeld, who filed his MESFET-like patent in Canada on October 22, 1925&quot; than is made in the current WKPD entry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is anything known about how internal clocks work? I&#039;m not sure if I can still do it, but when I watched tv, I had a very accurate idea of what an hour and a half hour were.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: My research implied that the internal clock of rats -- the one used to measure minutes and seconds -- resembled a stopwatch in several ways.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
