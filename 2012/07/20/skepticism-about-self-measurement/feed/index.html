		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I think data is just the method of life improvement that works very well for you.  I&#039;m sure there are people out there who can improve their life simply by wishing it, for years, and then one morning they wake up and pounce upon a discovery and their problem is solved.  But data works for me too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Self-measurement (which is a subset of self-awareness, a virtue lauded as &quot;an unexamined life is not worth living&quot;) is not new for individuals.

It&#039;s not new for business ventures (there&#039;s a whole profession dedicated to that, accounting. It helps with counting and paying taxes, but also with figuring out which parts of a business work, who is worth credit and who is not, etc.) 

Not engaging in self-measurement implies hurtling through the world willy-nilly, willfully ignoring indicators of trouble until the loudest indicator of all, collapse, is noted. 

Anyone who would belittle self-inspection and self-examination does not have the best interest of his readers at heart.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So where did you get the idea that standing might improve sleep? Was this from your research on sleep?

Seth: It was an accident. I tried standing a lot to see if I would lose weight. I noticed my sleep improved -- it helped that I was recording it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
