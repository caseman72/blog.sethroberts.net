		<description><![CDATA[&gt; &quot;This is more of the “blame the victim” bs that is rampant in our culture. It’s a huge part of the Tyranny of Positive Thinking that blames the patient and not the disease.&quot;

Er, what? No one&#039;s suggesting that people with Chrohn&#039;s disease are to blame. What this article is saying, is that a few specific foods and supplements might help. That&#039;s qualitatively the same sort of thing as saying that particular drugs might help, and I don&#039;t think blame enters into the discussion, nor should it.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Maybe he or she means I am &quot;blaming the victim&quot; because I note how easy it was to find Crohn&#039;s success stories. Which the two people I refer to did not do. Let&#039;s call it &quot;educating the victim&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

It&#039;s great that some people can remove their symptoms. However, all the diet changes and meditation and prayer and exercise and all of that did not change my symptoms one bit. Why? Because it&#039;s an auto-immune disease. My body is wacky, not my attitude and not the way I take care of myself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was diagnosed with Crohn&#039;s about 4 years ago. My doctor prescribed Asacol which reduced the symptoms for about 6 months. However they then returned with a vengeance. I wasn&#039;t thrilled with what came next on the treatment regimen so I did a lot of research, part of which first brought me to this blog, and stumbled across a YouTube video advocating the use of low doses of Naltrexone for the treatment of MS and other autoimmune conditions. 

Curiosity piqued, I found that it was also used successfully to treat Crohn&#039;s. I decided to self-experiment and ordered some Naltrexone from an online pharmacy. Within a couple of weeks my symptoms were noticeably better and after several months I started to reduce my Asacol dosage ending up at roughly half the prescribed dosage.

I am not ready to call myself cured but I have been without symptoms for at least a year and a half and have not had to be subjected to the escalation in treatment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife doesn&#039;t have Crohn&#039;s disease, but she has a history of idiopathic digestive problems -- possibly irritable bowel syndrome.  In any case, she&#039;s been drinking kombucha daily for the past few years and has experienced considerable relief (though some problems remain).  Prior to starting the kombucha, she tried various prescription drugs that either had no effect or actually made matters worse.  She&#039;s also tried other fermented foods (such as soy yogurt and miso) as well as several different probiotic supplements, but none of those had any effect.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s very interesting that kombucha was more effective than other fermented foods. It&#039;s hard to measure their general potency.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a niece with diabetes type 1. The parents, also, take the view that &quot;it has no known cure&quot; in spite of the fact that the internet has many, many cases of kids who have cured their diabetes with a change in diet (namely Dr. Natasha McBride&#039;s GAPS protocol and even Robb Wolf&#039;s Paleo Diet). I&#039;ve sent many references to them - the latest response is that it&#039;s just too hard to make these kinds of changes with a 12 year old! So, my niece will have to live with diabetes until she&#039;s old enough to do something about it herself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I often have digestive problems, sometimes including constipation, bloating, gas, and even a generalized discomfort all through my chest and abdomen.

I don&#039;t know what my medical diagnosis might be (celiac? IBS? Crohn&#039;s? gluten sensitivity?), because I&#039;ve never mentioned these problems to any doctors. Their solution to everything seems to be a bunch of drugs, and I can&#039;t imagine how assaulting my gut bacteria with a lot of chemicals can possibly be a good idea.

Instead of drugs, I&#039;ve been eating a lot of bowls of high-fiber cereal-like concoctions of nuts, seeds, raisins, plain Greek yogurt, ground flax seed, powdered cinnamon, Sweetleaf Stevia with inulin, and whole milk. I get most of the ingredients from my local Whole Foods Market.

I say &quot;cereal-like,&quot; because it tastes like a bowl of cold cereal, but there are no cereal grains involved. 

The mixture is delicious, and it seems to be really be helping my digestive problems.]]></description>
