		<description><![CDATA[A recommendation for A2Hosting:

&quot;When I first started blogging in 2007, I needed web hosting. I noticed that Merlin Mann had a note on 43 Folders about his happiness working with a company named A2 Hosting. That was good enough for me: I signed up for their introductory package.

That was five years ago and I’ve been nothing but happy with their service ever since.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Going through my logs, it looks as if someone has been attempting to guess my passwords, making tens of thousands of failed guesses, and Cyberultra made no attempt to filter them out.  However, since my passwords are unguessable, this was no problem for me.

The usual attack is to socially engineer password recovery services.  If anyone has been trying that on cyber ultra, they have failed.

		<description><![CDATA[Use Rackspace Cloud. It&#039;s not expensive. My pathetic affiliate link: http://www.rackspacecloud.com/550.html

I&#039;ve used them for a few years now. I&#039;ve needed their support people on a few occasions and they are always available, super helpful, and know what they are doing.

One time I thought some service I was using might down over an account issue. The support person&#039;s response? We never do that.]]></description>
