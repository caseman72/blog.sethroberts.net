		<description><![CDATA[(re:  Dr. Roberts&#039; numerical rating system)  I&#039;m very glad to hear how you interpret percentages and their corresponding feelings.  To me, this is the hardest part of self-experimentation, coming up with a rigorous, reproducible scale.

The percentages I used were &quot;what popped into my head from my gut&quot; when asking myself, so, how enthusiastic do I feel right now?  I am chronically sleep deprived, so I think that&#039;s why my numbers were so low.

I see your system provides guideposts for keeping the ratings consistent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Video game designers have been using this strategy for years now.  I first noticed this playing the online multiplayer game &quot;Call of Duty&quot;.  Even if you ended up with the worst score at the end of the game, you always received an accolade of some kind.  This positive feedback always had me playing the game well past a reasonable bed-time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried again, and this time my enthusiasm for the work increased over the hour while doing the dots.  I think it was just due to getting into the task, but the dots did give me an extra push to keep going.

The stream of ratings of my enthusiasm was (18% before starting), 22%, 14%, 22%, 19%, 20%, 26%, 22%, 33%, 30%, 26%.

Thanks for discussing this and the other productivity techniques.  They&#039;re fun to try.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: That&#039;s a good idea, measuring enthusiasm on a numerical scale. I think I would use a 0-100 scale with 50 = neutral, &gt;50 = want to do the task, &lt; 50 = don&#039;t want to do the task. Maybe 60 = barely want to, 70 = somewhat want to, 75 = want to, 80 = quite want to, 90 = very much want to.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This first experiment didn&#039;t give me any reason to think so.  All I noticed was that I was looking at the clock to see if it were time to make another dot.  I will try the system again tomorrow.

The percentile feedback system I downloaded here though has increased my productivity about 20% since I started using it three weeks ago.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Glad to hear it about the percentile feedback. About the dots: Their obvious value is to get started and gain momentum on difficult stuff. I don&#039;t think you will notice any effect on stuff that isn&#039;t hard to do.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I gave the dots a first try.  They didn&#039;t motivate me enough that I could keep at the task for a full hour.  There was confounding from the effects of coffee, though.  I kept track of my motivation while using the dots, and it went down the whole time, but that was because caffeine was wearing off.

I guess my point is the effect isn&#039;t stronger than caffeine, but I&#039;ll give it another go later.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: My first question is: do they motivate you at all? Meaning: do they make work easier?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;ve been using this type of secondary reinforcement for some of my pigeon and rat studies, too. It&#039;s very useful when the subject must complete a set of responses before receiving its primary reinforcement.

I&#039;d say the reason why the rats were exploring the box throughout the session when you gave them random food deliveries is that you kept activating the general search mode (exploration) of the food reward system. This idea ties into the behavioral systems theory work of Staddon &amp; Simlehaug, Shettleworth, and Timberlake. I doubt that ANY activity would increase (in fact, you state that sleeping curled up in a ball decreased), but certainly feeding-related activities (which includes exploring for more food) would increase. Self grooming might be another activity that would decrease (cf. Sara Shettleworth&#039;s studies of hamsters in the 1970s).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrea:  I&#039;ve seen a similar app available for Android and iPhone, called Job Jar.  It has the random selection I want, but not the cracking-the-whip-every-9-minutes functionality.  I suppose you could download that, then use a stopwatch app (or a real stopwatch) in conjunction with it.

I&#039;m a programmer, so I often cook up apps for my own use with no desire to distribute them commercially.  I&#039;ve thought about rewriting this Windows app to work on my Android phone, but haven&#039;t put that on my to-do list yet, ha-ha.  It would take more than 9 minutes!]]></description>

How many days after starting up the dots method again, was it before you first had the can&#039;t wait to get started feeling?

		<description><![CDATA[I guess both systems are good.  (the box, and percentile feedback)  Your mind just became inured to the percentile feedback system and so it is not having the same exciting effect on your productivity.  Maybe in a few months you will switch back to percentile feedback.  Do you think?

I notice the same thing with hobbies.  No matter how much I love something, after I&#039;ve done a lot of it it gets stale.

This is too bad.  I could create a menu of hobbies for myself and rotate among them to keep my excitement high every day, but it&#039;s difficult to make progress at something when one must drop it and pick it back up frequently.  Not to mention finding enough things that I actually really enjoy.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Percentile reinforcement becomes hard for me when for whatever reason productivity goes down. It is hard to look at low scores all day.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple years ago I came up with a similar timer-based strategy to handle household chores.  I wrote a simple Windows app that, every 9 minutes, grabs a random item from my long to-do list, displays it, and beeps loudly (in case I&#039;m not in the same room as the computer).  I settled on 9 minutes because that was usually enough time to do the kind of task on my list (start a load of laundry, wash dishes, pay bills, order vitamins, brainstorm ways to improve my diet, etc.).  I find it to be a very effective motivator - it makes even the most tedious tasks almost enjoyable when I know in 9 minutes I can drop it.  The randomness is important, too.  If I did things in the order I&#039;d prefer to do them, the cat&#039;s litter box would never get changed.

I noticed the higher energy effect, too.  But I always thought it was physiological, not psychological.  Most of my tasks involve getting up and physically doing something, so I assumed the energy came from deeper breathing and getting some light exercise.]]></description>
