		<description><![CDATA[I believe that food is the cause and the cure - Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food.

I suffered from GERD for many years, was a Prilosec addict, then discovered Paleo/Primal/etc. Eliminating grains in effect eliminated the dairy - I didn&#039;t drink milk ala carte and drank my coffee and tea black.  No more GERD no more Prilosec.

I was able, after several months, to add back grass fed cream and butter with no obvious consequences, however, plain milk and yogurt still caused a little heartburn. A few weeks ago I decided to try raw milk and so far all is good. And, the pleasure of a cold glass of milk is under appreciated.

I have also noticed a small positive change in body comp - lost some stubborn lower (below the navel) belly fat.

So, when it comes to milk, pasteurization and homogenization, could be the problem - not the milk per se.  It would be interesting to see if Mark Bittman would be willing to challenge his biases and give raw milk a try.

FYI - I am 65 yrs old and probably genetically tolerant of milk (real milk) due to Swiss ancestry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple fundamental problems with medicine today.

1)  Western medicine, in most cases, is embarrassingly similar to shamanism. 

Most of the time, doctors have little or no idea as what they&#039;re doing, even though they have great power and prescribe substances with great ceremony with great confidence.  We like to laugh at the ignorance of physicians of the 18th century; my guess is that those of the 23rd century will laugh at us.  

Notable exceptions being where cause and effect are visibly obvious.  For example, if I get by a car and my bones are broken and I am bleeding severely. In cases, like these, by all means, take me to a emergency room and fix me up with the latest and greatest in medical technology STAT!  

2)  Doctors are trained to fix the symptom, not the cause.  They are also largely the puppets of Big Pharma.  I suffered migraines my whole life until my 30s. I am prescribed meds to help me manage the pain. These meds are better than nothing.  

Then I quit eating grain-based products, no migraines ever. 

(Interesting to note is that I don&#039;t *know* if it is gluten or some other concomitant substance to which I am sensitive.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I pretty much agree with Javeux, low-carb or avoidance of certain type/class of food can work, but it&#039;s only a band aid.

And unlike Seth, I am not surprised that doctors and food writers often fail to see the food - gut connection and are not aware of these &quot;easy&quot; fixes. Overall, the Time article looks like a manifestation of the Dunning-Kruger effect - which is when you only know little about something, you easily overestimate your skills or amount of knowledge you possess. Overall, nutrition is in its dark ages compared to other disciplines, e.s. physics]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me the whole premise &amp; approach to GERD is backwards. The stomach is SUPPOSED to be Acidic &amp; if you make it less Acidic, OF COURSE you are going to cause problems (C. difficile associated diarrhea, Pneumonia, Fractures, B12 deficiency, Hypomagnesemia, etc.). It seems like such a simple concept, I refuse to believe that intelligent people in Medicine can&#039;t grasp this.

As far as GERD being sub-clinical, it is until it isn&#039;t. GERD can progress to Barrett&#039;s esophagus, which can in turn progress to Cancer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was prescribed PPIs once, but I couldn&#039;t understand how they&#039;d provide a cure or justify their side-effects, so I didn&#039;t end up filling the prescription. I suggested to the doctor that my long-standing joint pains could perhaps be related to my long-standing GI complaints, but he didn&#039;t &#039;see how that would work.&#039; Luckily, this was an NHS doctor. If I had a snarky GI taking half a day&#039;s pay off me to waste my time with unscientific anti-treatments, I wouldn&#039;t be so complacent.

I got relief from GERD when eating a low-carb diet, but it just seems to be a crutch, rather than a real solution, like for diabetes and other things people use them for. It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if some of the people posting in Bittman&#039;s comments had underlying problems that dairy was taking the wrap for, e.g. oestrogen can inhibit lactase enzymes http://pmid.us/21080139 Antibiotic use probably wouldn&#039;t help support the bacteria that help digest lactose either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The idea that people should expect doctors to ignore &quot;subclinical&quot; problems is one of the most moronic things I&#039;ve ever heard. As if anyone – including doctors – know what is &quot;subclinical&quot; without investigation!

The New York Times had two articles in the past two weeks about a 12-year-old boy who went from complete health to dead within two days because of a scraped knee. The doctors missed all the signs of sepsis, no doubt out of their conviction that it was a &quot;subclinical&quot; problem unworthy of their time.

Back on the topic of Gerd, when I was diagnosed, I didn&#039;t hear a single thing about diet from my gastroenterologist, supposedly one of the best in my state. Just take two Aciphex (proton pump inhibitor) daily, and elevate the head of my bed.

I got the idea that he thought diet had nothing to do with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suffered from GERD my entire life, until I went on the Atkins diet. Over the years, I was prescribed various antihistamines to stop my &quot;allergies&quot;, which largely consisted of post-nasal drip (caused by GERD). Eventually, I was prescribed a proton pump inhibitor. By this point, I had developed esophageal ulcers from the frequent vomiting that came with the GERD*. Fortunately, with medical treatment, the ulcers healed. After stumbling on a dietary cure for the GERD, the post-nasal drip and the vomiting also went away. 

I don&#039;t care if the problems were subclinical, they caused me lots of trouble.

(*The ulcers probably developed while I was on another medication that caused nausea.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true that the high and mighty doctors don&#039;t have 2 minutes to explain how to fix these &quot;sub-clinical&quot; problems, but how much more time each day would the doctors have to deal with the &quot;real&quot; problems if they quickly disposed of these easy ones?

I suspect this is less of an example of doctors having more important stuff to do than it is a case of their ignorance. The learn very little about nutrition in medical school, and we know one thing, doctors NEVER admit their ignorance.

For a doctor to take a patient&#039;s money, whether the problem is &quot;sub-clinical&quot; or not, he should have a duty to provide decent care and help that patient. If he&#039;s too busy to do a thorough job, then he should not schedule as many patients and take a hit in income.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The big truth is these are sub clinical problems, and most doctors don&#039;t have time to deal with them.

My father is a GI.  He had a patient die on him last week during a procedure.  When the next patient comes in complaining of an upset tummy -- and he is fat, out of shape, and prone to eating a lot of polish sausage, what do you expect any doctor to say?  Doctors have real problems to face -- not these subclincal ones.

Yes, after 40 you have to be your own physician.  But are these subclinical problems something you can blame the medical establishment for.  Take two asprin and call me in the morning....]]></description>
