		<description><![CDATA[On a somewhat related note, this is a very interesting article on a therapist dealing with her own mid-life crisis. In a way it illustrates the value of personal science, due to the futility of seeking help from a professional who is likely to be unsuccessfully dealing with their own issues:

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: yes, very interesting article and very good point about its relation to personal science.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;There is surely a window of effectiveness — a time period outside of which the faces do nothing — but when? And how long? I don’t know. It surely depends on your exposure to sunlight, which is incredibly hard to measure.&quot;

Why are you sure there is a window.  Why are you sure exposure to sunlight interacts with it?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I varied the time I saw the faces. The time made a big difference. Later in the day, such as noon, they had no effect at all. The window must be open and shut by another clock and sunlight is the only plausible driver of such a clock.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m convinced that irritability is a thing in itself. Serenity might also be a thing. 

For a while, I&#039;d get irritable whenever I had a hot flash, and that seemed reasonable because I generally don&#039;t like being overheated. Then I had some no irritability hot  flashes, and I concluded that there were some PMS symptoms involved in some hot flashes, but not all of them. (Note: hot flashes vary tremendously, and not just by intensity.)

It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if some irritability is a nutritional issue. I&#039;m pretty sure that not all depression has a large component of irritability.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does this technique apply mainly to single people? I am wondering if I could improve my mood if I took a good look at my husband&#039;s face in the morning instead of rushing around.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: You need 15-30 minutes to get a noticeable difference. A few minutes, no.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s never been clear to me is how many faces are needed to have a favorable effect.  Is watching one person performing a monologue for 30 minutes enough, or is a random sampling of faces flashed onto a screen for a few seconds apiece just as or more effective?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: One person is enough. Most of my research was done watching Booknotes on C-Span, which involves two persons.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
