		<description><![CDATA[I guess the definition of &#039;cured&#039; is quite broad. I mean, what is it really? No symptoms, no matter what you do? No symptoms when you do what most people do?

I consider my arthritis (and my depression) cured, even though I&#039;m pretty sure they will recur if I decided to eat like my sister does for any length of time.  Her way is not healthy, although for the moment she &#039;seems&#039; to be getting away with it. 

Find the cause and deal with it, then you are cured.   Maybe it&#039;s a psychological thing - people don&#039;t want to feel different, and if they have to live differently to others, they still feel &#039;sick&#039; or &#039;faulty&#039;. 

@Peter, testing special diets is, unfortunately, never going to be a well-funded area. There is no big, expensive drug to market at the end of it, and if you implicate a big part of the food industry (e.g. grains), they will bite back with quite a bit of well-funded force.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our friend&#039;s daughter&#039;s gastroenterolgist says 1) there&#039;s no scientific proof that the SCD diet relieves symptoms and 2) online testimonials are self-selected to cover only positive outcomes. This doctor practices at the #1 rated children&#039;s hospital in the world.
He may merely be callous and intellectually uncurious but he is the patient-facing representative for an evil system. That he is paid a vast amount of money and the recipient of much professional adulation is maddening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please don&#039;t use the word &quot;cure&quot; in association with dietary management of Crohn&#039;s; it&#039;s no more of a cure than is a gluten-free diet for celiacs. You don&#039;t fix the root problem.

That said, for &gt;4-1/2 years, I have been on an SCD-type diet, and found complete relief after tweaking it in. Specifically, I lean towards a meat-heavy, grain-free diet with plenty of Gottschall-type yogurt. Carbohydrate restriction helps more than anything; I find I do best with lots of fatty beef, but (of course) the diarrhea needs to stop first.

After about a year on the SCD, I found the works of Dr. Wolfgang Lutz, who found a low-carb diet worked wonders for Crohn&#039;s. I combined the two, and have found complete relief. The only times I have problems are when I stray from the diet, either by accident (usually when testing new food products), or during experiments.

My weight is normal, I have had *no* diarrhea for more than 4 years now, no bleeding, and have a labor-intensive job that requires my lifting almost 150% of my own body weight. But the disease is still there, and if I eat the wrong thing, it comes to the surface promptly. But since I don&#039;t eat the wrong things except on rare occasions, my blood values are normal, my fecal calprotectin is normal- I&#039;m waiting to get another colonoscopy done, but I am confident the results will be very good.

The root of the disease is in grains, and secondarily to sugars. Complicating this is a massive imbalance in the intestinal flora- which is why probiotics help, and fecal &quot;transplants&quot; cause marked relief in many. Too many antibiotics, not enough fermented foods, too many sugars, WAY too much starch- and not enough vitamin D.

For the love of all things holy, PLEASE take your vitamin D if you have Crohn&#039;s, even if you get sunlight. Take 2,000 to 5,000 IU vitamin D every day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scurvy is not a chronic autoimmune disease. Scurvy IS vitamin c deficiency. Generally &quot;curing&quot; an ai is actually putting symptoms in remission and keeping them there.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I was under the impression that scurvy was caused by Vitamin C deficiency. If taking a drug once/month puts your symptoms in remission, but as soon as you stop the drug your symptoms come back, are you cured? I believe people would say no.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was told that my osteo-arthritis was incurable and that I was heading for an early hip replacement (I was 37 at the time). Now, four years later, I&#039;d say it&#039;s &#039;cured&#039; and my method was a gut healing diet (GAPS diet, actually). That was very restrictive for about 4 months and now I just try to stay away from certain foods and I&#039;m ok. I tend to think of these things more as hypersensitivities which require long-term management - it&#039;s probably a combination of genetic profile + metabolic damage caused by long term consumption of foods you are not genetically designed to eat so much of. A sort of low-level allergy.

As a &#039;side-effect&#039; my depression disappeared and has never recurred to the same level - I just don&#039;t have the level of &#039;low&#039; that used to exist in my brain.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: This supports my belief that the foods that make your brain work best will turn out to make the rest of your body work best and vice versa.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are these people cured or are they simply controlling their illness better by eating a strict diet?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, it&#039;s a grey area. After I come down with scurvy, I am careful to eat a diet that contains enough Vitamin C and never get scurvy again. Is that controlling my illness by eating a strict diet? People usually say that Vitamin C cures scurvy. I suppose I should ask people who say Crohn&#039;s has &quot;no known cure&quot; what they mean.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
