		<description><![CDATA[Thank God for Seth&#039;s book and blog.  These have all changed my habits and improved my life.  I tend to get more immediate relief with the morning faces, that&#039;s my only difference.  Good work my friend.  I am so thankful to stumble upon The Shangri-La Diet many years ago.

Looking forward to your next light bulb moment.  

I&#039;m sure you are familiar with David Asprey&#039;s work which resembles some of your theories.  Would love to hear your view on his strategies.  Thanks!]]></description>
