		<description><![CDATA[Why is it important to make sure a medical ultrasound is properly calibrated and maintained?

“Ultrasound is used in labs normally for lysing cells, for ripping them open and getting out the DNA,” 
So, how many ways can medical ultrasound go wrong and create the same effect? Can it accidentally get lensed or echo?]]></description>

This seems to me as personal science in action - even if it is only for the benefit of the originator.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe because you actually have an educational background in statistics and psychology I think you have a slight advantage at personal science.  I also think you might have a more innate ability for observation.  Some people are able analysis their behavior but are unable to be successful.  

The question then is why is Seth Roberts so successful at personal science/low plausibility ideas while others fail?

For instance, I tried an extremely low-salt diet (low-flavor) and was able to lose 10 pounds.  Then I could not stand the lack of flavor and started to eat salt again thus gaining back all the weight. 

I have been doing personal science all my life with abysmal outcomes.  I can’t think of any idea I have ever come up after careful observation has changed my life in a significant way.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: My weight loss ideas derived from a combination of unexpected observation and new theory. But a lot of other things I have found that worked came from long-term monitoring (e.g., sleep) that turned up a sudden change. That&#039;s what led me to study one-legged standing and butter, for example. I think long-term monitoring is something many people can do.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
