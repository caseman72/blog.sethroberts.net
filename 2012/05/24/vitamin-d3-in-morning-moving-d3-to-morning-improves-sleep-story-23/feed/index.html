I have a daughter 28 years old with severe disrupted sleep pattern developed over several years, meaning being up all night and stay up for two days and then go to bed at 4 pm and things like that. When she later wanted a more normal sleep. She had problem and never know if she  would fell a sleep at 6 pm or 6 am. She also never know if she would sleep to 3 am or 4 pm and she has really tried to have it working for over a year now with out any success.

After reading this amazing blog I gave here a bottle of D3 for about 10 days ago, the first days 8000 Iu and after reading  more on the blog 10.000. 
She gets help most of the day that someone calls at 11 –12 am and she take the D3 up on awaking.   The amazing results is that  she has not have one single day  that she has fell a sleep at 6 pm and she also have more energies.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for posting this story.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Do you have any results from personal experiments or anecdotal reports on using D3 to support an off-hours sleep schedule? I need to work 2 out of every 3 weeks on a 1am-1pm schedule, which requires going to bed around 5pm when it&#039;s quite light out and waking up around 12am. 

Do you know anyone who&#039;s tried D3 on waking to adjust their biological clock for an off-hours schedule, or perhaps for jet lag?

Thank you for all of your research and for publishing these reports on D3 and other supplements!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No I don&#039;t. I will soon fly from Beijing to San Francisco and I will use D3 to combat jet lag.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Jim for sharing, I found it very valued and interesting to understand more.  If I understand your story right, it actually take you many years to rich the right levels on D3, even as you took 10.000 IU daily. That could explain the  reason why I after only one week does not yet have reached the good sleep.
The travel part was also very good to know, how important the right levels are.]]></description>
