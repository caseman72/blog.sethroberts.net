		<description><![CDATA[Seth, thanks for providing this info.  It is extremely important and I&#039;m surprised no one else has commented yet.  

To my way of thinking, the story of medical overtreatment should have exploded into a major scandal years ago; and I don&#039;t understand why the main stream media hasn&#039;t been all over it.  Must be the &quot;anechoic&quot; effect at work;  Dr. Roy Poses at Healthcare Renewal has been talking about that for a very long time.

Thanks again for your blog and the interesting topics you bring to us.

WB]]></description>
