		<description><![CDATA[Have you looked into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terrywahls.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Terry Wahls&#039;&lt;/a&gt; recommendations?

She&#039;s a doctor with MS who did her own research, developed a mitochondria-supporting diet (at least, that&#039;s the theory), and restored her health. 

I&#039;m bringing this up because vitamin K2 is present in cabbage and such, and Wahls&#039; diet is heavy on veggies, specifically including cruciferous vegetables.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;ve heard about her findings, yes. But hadn&#039;t made the connection with K2.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
