		<description><![CDATA[Alex: try Gerd Gigerenzer&#039;s book on Risk.  It&#039;s excellent, easy enough even for medics to follow, and very mind-clearing.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It is quite possible to run a study that produces for each patient a p value for the null hypothesis of no effect (a number that helps you decide if that particular patient has been helped) but this too has not been done.

Since these new analyses would benefit drug companies, their absence is curious.&quot;

I don&#039;t know what kind of test in particular you are thinking of (matching?), but if you can causally link an individual patient&#039;s health improvements to the drug, that means you can also link an individual patient&#039;s health deterioration to the drug.

Enter lawsuits?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to say that I find statistics to be very confusing, both in the abstract and the concrete.  I&#039;m currently reading, &lt;i&gt;The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes&#039; Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy&lt;/i&gt;, and I can&#039;t make sense of why, exactly, there was so much controversy over Bayes&#039; Rule.  I feel like I&#039;m missing something, which is how I often feel when I try to understand statistics.  So, likewise, I don&#039;t know why drug companies would neglect to apply a statistical test that would likely work in their favor.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Thanks for the book recommendation. The test I am talking about would need to be invented/developed. That is one reason it has not yet been applied. I suppose a drug company executive would say: Innovations in this area would not help us get drugs approved. There is a certain evaluation system. We need to follow it.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>
