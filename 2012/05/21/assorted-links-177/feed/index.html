		<description><![CDATA[Thanks - if you read my post carefully, my sleep problem didn&#039;t happen because of what I ate, it was more of a timing issue. Flaxseed oil has a strong flavour, so you have to drink it with your nose clipped for it to work. Anxiety about sleep (or more typically about other things) can also have an impact- so I think we have to strike a balance between doing absolutely nothing about this problem and being overly concerned about it. Best of luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mitra
Thank you for taking the time to answer me on all the questions. I thought that I had read all the posts on sleep.
Anyway after increase the dose to 9600 yesterday the sleep was better. If you have had a good deep and it went  away whit a diet, it seams to me that what you eat really matters to sleep. All this years I have struggled, I have been told that I need to relax more and it is only happens to me, because I am stressed :-)
Now it is summer and light in the morning, and very easy to get sun in the morning. But half the year it is dark when you go to and from work. I am thinking maybe to bay sun light box. I have one of the earlier  and it did nor work that well, but the are very developed today.
I got the Shangri La book yesterday so I hade read a lot yesterday. I tried  to take oil capsule between breakfast and lunch as I was on the move, when I usually are starving. It worked very well and I could wait for a late lunch. But between lunch and dinner I used some flaxseed oil and it did nor work so well, I was starving after  some time. But I am new so it will take some practice with try  and error until it works as designed

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Anne, 

I will try to answer your questions  BASED on the information that is already provided on Seth&#039;s blog and Seth&#039;s response to my questions. First, I think you can take butter anytime through the day, but Seth found taking fat (animal fat?) in the evening helped his sleep, so I plan on taking 60% of my butter in the evening. To skip breakfast, it should ideally be 3 hours after waking up - like if you WANT to wake up at 7 AM, don&#039;t eat earlier than 10 A.M. Usually, it is recommended that people eat dinner 2-3 hours before they go to bed. Early sun exposure (along with Vitamin D3 in the morning) should strengthen your circadian rhythm and help with sleep. I don&#039;t know about omega 3 fish oil or flaxseed oil - I mean I don&#039;t know whether they can be taken together with butter or only butter is enough. You can experiment with all combinations. (Seth also says that more social contact in the morning and less social interaction in the evening can help - I found this to be true).  Also, remember lot of standing in a day or one-legged standing enough number of times. You will find more info on these things in Seth&#039;s blog if you look at the topic &quot;sleep&quot; here. (Personally I felt less hungry when I started eating a fat heavy low carbohydrate diet). I take my dietary advice from Seth and from another book called &quot;Perfect Health Diet&quot; by Paul Jaminet. 

I plan to experiment with these remedies using Seth&#039;s advice. If these don&#039;t work for me, and given my specific problem, I also plan to take time release melatonin tablet one hour before bedtime for a week and see if it helps. It is annoying because I had perfectly fine sleep before I screwed it up by trying to do intermittent fasting in a wrong way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth
I will start to thank a lot for this goldmine of information you share on the blog and all the help with answer you give to everyone. That is so amazing rare in this age, and have put you on to my favorite to find the best information. I have read in  to all the posts for days now and tried out all the tips for sleeping, except not enough one leg standing.
When I saw this questions and your answers about sleep from Mitra. I almost get all the needed answers to many of my questions. As I have wondered when the best time for D3 was in the morning and if I should take the high amount of butter to. My experience so  far  is that I wake up earlier and earlier now in this test.
I have started to take 7.200 iu of D3  some were between 6.30 am to 7.30 am and around 5 to six tsp of butter a day to my meals. Yesterday I even tried to take 2 tsp of flaxseed oil at 11 pm, after reading a post about that. But today I woke up even earlier than ever at 4.30 am and was not able to get back to sleep, as I was extremely hungry.  I am always very hungry in the morning and are not able to skip breakfast yet. I have order the Shangri-La diet book and hope to have it any day now. But I  don&#039;t now how much answers there is on sleep in the book. 
I saw your answers to Mitra , so I have increased the D3 to  9600  today and also understand the right time to take it, as I have wondered about that to. 
But I still have some questions ( I live in Sweden and I am 5,5 inch tall and 150 punds.)

Does it matter when you have the butter to promote longer and better sleep
To skip breakfast,how long has it to be before eating after wake up
Does it matter what  to eat and how long before bed, you eat dinner
Does early sun  exposure get me to sleep longer 
Do you take Omega 3 fish oil as well and If when in the day
Do you take Flaxseed as well as butter or only one of them

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot. Seth. I will do this....I need to be go to bed a little early to wake up at 7 A.M and take the Vitamin D then. You are right about the dosages, I saw now that you recommend 60 grams of butter. ( I also probably shouldn&#039;t lie on bed so long after waking up so that I get morning sun sooner rather than only after 9 AM). 

I am 5 feet 9 inches (age 37) and my weight is now 170 pounds (male). I lost 14 pounds over the last three months (a Paleo style diet and 1600 calories a day approx), so I am not too overweight now, but I still have some abdominal fat and I also have impaired glucose tolerance or pre-diabetes and want to get my weight in the optimal range. (particularly given that I am South Asian and at a high risk for diabetes). Thanks a lot again for generously sharing your advice and all the great info on your fantabulous blog!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, 

Thanks a lot for your response. Here are the answers to your questions. 

a) I am taking a little more than one table spoon of butter every day. I also eat meat and eggs fairly regularly - though it is often difficult to get fatty cuts of meat due to the low fat craze! I am eating the butter during the evening - around 8 PM. Should I eat more butter/animal fat? 

b) I used to take 1000 IU of Vitamin D every night. For the past two weeks, I switched to morning (after reading discussion of this in your blog) - then I upped my doze to 2000 IU in the morning - now for the last 2 days I have again upped my doze to 3000 IU in the morning around 9 AM. Should I try increasing my dose again? 

c) I have a lawn and the sun falls on it directly every morning. (I live in Brisbane which is often sunny on most months). So I stand (standing desk) and work on my computer in front of the lawn every morning starting around 9 AM.  I would get more morning sun if I take a walk outside (it is a lawn rather than a back porch, so the roof is covered), but I don&#039;t do this until later in the day. I wake up around 7.30 every day, but I lie on my bed till 9 every morning trying to get back to sleep, so my day begins at 9 AM. 

Thanks again for your help. If I do try melatonin, are you aware of any negative side effects of melatonin? (I didn&#039;t find much in the literature, except that people ask you not to take it regularly, because then your body stops making enough of it once it senses it in the blood).

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Sorry, don&#039;t know about melatonin. I suggest you increase your butter intake to 4 T/day. And take 10000 IU of Vitamin D at 7 am. Continue the morning sun exposure. That should help a lot. After you are sleeping better you can reduce the Vitamin D and/or butter until your sleep gets worse, if you dislike those amounts. I don&#039;t know your weight but you have been taking dosages that are quite far from what data posted on this blog suggests are best.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, 

I have another question on an issue related to sleep. (thanks a ton for your response last time!). Sorry to bother you with this, but I thought you might find my experience interesting given your research on circadian rhythms...so here goes!

Generally I used to go to bed anytime between 4 AM and 6 AM every day and wake up 7-8 hours later- it was a pretty weird routine, but it worked for me, I slept well and continuously, woke up well rested and never had any trouble with sleep. (I am an academic mostly working from home, not a shift worker). Suddenly I started having trouble sleeping - couldn&#039;t fall asleep on my usual time on quite a few occasions which left me puzzled - since there was nothing new in my life that would cause stress/anxiety etc. 

I later understood (my inference) that the way I practised intermittent fasting  probably screwed up my sleep/wake cycle.(I was also taking Vitamin D at night while starting to eat more healthy and roughly following a Paleo style diet).  In an attempt to loose weight, I would eat only one major meal in 24 hours and I would take that meal before I go to bed - that means at 2 AM or 3 AM. (taking only light snacks through the day). I read a Harvard study that suggested that if an animal takes food after a 16 hour fast, then its body starts treating the time when it takes food as &quot;morning&quot;.  According to Paul Jaminet, food intake dominates light in the setting of circadian rhythm, given the role the liver can play in the setting of the biological clock (particularly true in an environment of food scarcity created through the fasting). http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-naturally-reset-your-sleep-cycle-overnight

To fix my routine, I have now started (a month back) going to bed at around 12- 1 AM after having dinner at normal time at 8 PM, but I observe two problems. First, I have occasional trouble falling asleep which is quite unusual for me. Second, I wake up after sleeping 5-6 hours every day and can&#039;t go to sleep after that, which is very unusual for me as well. I don&#039;t typically feel very tired throughout the day, so it is not a big problem I guess, but I don&#039;t feel nearly as well rested as I did before and I know 7-8 hours sleep is healthier, so I want to fix this if I can. 

I found your blog while investigating these issues - I have been trying out some of your ideas - skipping breakfast, morning sun, morning faces, Vitamin D and animal fat. They have helped, but haven&#039;t completely resolved the issue. (I am still continuing to experiment with your ideas, however). I was wondering whether you think .....a) Taking a time release melatonin tablet one hour before bedtime will help in more firmly re-establishing circadian rhythm - does melatonin have a role in this? b) Any other ideas? (Now I eat at 12 at noon and 8 PM at night, so only lunch and dinner, two meals in a day with only a small snack in between). 

Thanks a lot for your time if you have read up to this (don&#039;t blame you if you didn&#039;t) and hope you find my problem interesting! Best
p.s: One clue - I have more trouble sleeping on those nights when I have more social contact in the evening.

Seth: How much Vitamin D3 are you taking and when are you taking it? How much sun exposure in the morning are you getting and when? I&#039;ve never tested melatonin. How much butter are you eating and when?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Seth, </p>
<p>I have another question on an issue related to sleep. (thanks a ton for your response last time!). Sorry to bother you with this, but I thought you might find my experience interesting given your research on circadian rhythms&#8230;so here goes!</p>
<p>Generally I used to go to bed anytime between 4 AM and 6 AM every day and wake up 7-8 hours later- it was a pretty weird routine, but it worked for me, I slept well and continuously, woke up well rested and never had any trouble with sleep. (I am an academic mostly working from home, not a shift worker). Suddenly I started having trouble sleeping &#8211; couldn&#8217;t fall asleep on my usual time on quite a few occasions which left me puzzled &#8211; since there was nothing new in my life that would cause stress/anxiety etc. </p>
<p>I later understood (my inference) that the way I practised intermittent fasting  probably screwed up my sleep/wake cycle.(I was also taking Vitamin D at night while starting to eat more healthy and roughly following a Paleo style diet).  In an attempt to loose weight, I would eat only one major meal in 24 hours and I would take that meal before I go to bed &#8211; that means at 2 AM or 3 AM. (taking only light snacks through the day). I read a Harvard study that suggested that if an animal takes food after a 16 hour fast, then its body starts treating the time when it takes food as &#8220;morning&#8221;.  According to Paul Jaminet, food intake dominates light in the setting of circadian rhythm, given the role the liver can play in the setting of the biological clock (particularly true in an environment of food scarcity created through the fasting). <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-naturally-reset-your-sleep-cycle-overnight" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-naturally-reset-your-sleep-cycle-overnight</a></p>
<p>To fix my routine, I have now started (a month back) going to bed at around 12- 1 AM after having dinner at normal time at 8 PM, but I observe two problems. First, I have occasional trouble falling asleep which is quite unusual for me. Second, I wake up after sleeping 5-6 hours every day and can&#8217;t go to sleep after that, which is very unusual for me as well. I don&#8217;t typically feel very tired throughout the day, so it is not a big problem I guess, but I don&#8217;t feel nearly as well rested as I did before and I know 7-8 hours sleep is healthier, so I want to fix this if I can. </p>
