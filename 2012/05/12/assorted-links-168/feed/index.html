		<description><![CDATA[Probiotics also prevent diarrhea in coeliacs, caused by gluten. I, a coeliac, always take probiotics, my daughter - also coeliac - usually forgets to. We have, on occasion been &#039;glutenated&#039; at the same events, and I always react &#039;better&#039;, ie am less affected than her. 
The gluten doesn&#039;t just cause food poisoning symptoms - more seriously it causes brain fog or concentration problems. The probiotics protect me from the brain fog too.
(I use lactobaccilus and saccharomyces boullardii.)
I believe other coeliacs find this too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A naive question: I understand that consuming a lot of dairy is associated with constipation. Mostly, there was a reliance on lactobacillus in the studies that were covered here. What is the connection between the constipation associated with dairy, the reduced diarrhea, and the lactobacillus -- if any?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Lactobacillus reduce diarrhea because they push out the bad diarrhea-causing bacteria. I suppose they do a better job digesting your food. I don&#039;t know why diary causes constipation.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
