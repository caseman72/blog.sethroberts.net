		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m puzzled by these stories of Chinese &quot;medicines&quot; being made from ground-up fetuses, or rhino horns, or bear bile, or some such crazy thing.  Why don&#039;t the manufacturers just use fake ingredients?  Who would ever know?  Plus, it&#039;s a lot cheaper.  God only knows how much real rhino horns cost these days.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if the following article is the one you are referring to or not, but it&#039;s pretty similar. Although it&#039;s not the Yangtze river.

http://www.chinasmack.com/2012/pictures/rainbow-river-unused-medicine-capsules-dumped-in-henan-ditch.html

But this story is available for viewing in China, having said that it&#039;s not in Chinese, but was translated from the original story that was in Chinese.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. I was told the story was censored in China...that doesn&#039;t mean it was entirely censored, but what you link to raises the possibility that it wasn&#039;t censored at all.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[whatever the credibility problems of China, the South Koreans seem to have a penchant for lying to make themselves look good. 

From Wiki &quot;Hwang Woo-suk (Korean: 황우석, born January 29, 1953)[1] is a South Korean veterinarian and researcher. He was a professor of theriogenology and biotechnology at Seoul National University (dismissed on March 20, 2006) who became infamous for fabricating a series of experiments, which appeared in high-profile journals, in the field of stem cell research.&quot;
  In addition, as i recall they were sore losers at the Olympics.  the story about human baby parts sounds like pure bullsh*t.  The other 2 examples are plausible.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t think the &quot;baby pill&quot; story makes South Koreans -- in particular the journalists who reported it -- look good. Rather, it makes Chinese look bad.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
