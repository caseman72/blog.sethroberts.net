		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely agree that modern medicine needs to change, and I&#039;m a huge fan of your blog. Fermented food has made me healthier, and flaxseed oil has helped my gums.

However, I have to point out that Dr. Blaylock is a member of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a primarily political organization that publishes &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; research claiming HIV doesn&#039;t cause AIDS and Obama is a hypnotist (seriously). Their journal barely contains any scientific articles, just essays about how Obamacare is a communist menace, and what to do when the FBI raids your practice (again, seriously).

They also published that study you posted a couple years ago showing that autism rates were falling due to the removal of mercury from vaccines, which relied on questionable data and some eyebrow-raising outliers. And of course we know that autism rates have not fallen - they continue to rise: http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/30/local/la-me-0330-autism-rates-20120330

And just for fun, here&#039;s &quot;A Doctors’ Wives’ Survival Guide, or What To Do When the FBI Knocks at the Door&quot;

He was also a physician and blindly trusted his doctors advice!  We also experienced the stone walling, lack of coordination of care and following of protocols without thinking.]]></description>
