		<description><![CDATA[This thread seems long dead but I just read the blog entry. You say &#039;At one point a French journalist is given a transcript of a call that DSK made. How was this possible? the journalist asked. The answer given is that by freakish coincidence “DSK’s speaker phone was accidentally left on while his line was somehow connected to a French phone that was legally under surveillance.” Why the speaker phone should matter is not explained.&#039;

Maybe I&#039;m missing something but the possible explanation that jumps immediately to mind is that DSK left his speakerphone on, connected to a phone under surveillance, while he made a call on his cell phone or on another phone. This would of course let the surveillers (if that&#039;s a word) hear DSK&#039;s end of the conversation, or, if his other phone was also on speaker, would let them hear the whole thing.

That part seems easy enough and quite plausible; for instance, I use my office phone for some calls and my cell phone for others (even when I&#039;m in my office) so if I somehow were to leave my speakerphone on, this could happen to me.  

Or at least, it could happen to me if my speakerphone were connected to another phone that was under surveillance. But that&#039;s the part that seems wildly improbable. For this to have happened, DSK _and_ the party on the other line would have to have _both_ failed to hang up. Or at least I think that&#039;s the case.  Maybe it isn&#039;t; maybe if the person on the other end hung up, but DSK didn&#039;t the connection would still exist?  If so then this is at least plausible: if DSK fails to hang up his phone 1% of the time, and the person on the other end is the same, then this is the difference between a 1% chance and a 0.01% chance.]]></description>

was the transcript found in Sarkozy&#039;s pockets? His home? His office?

		<description><![CDATA[Unless you have strong evidence from the book or elsewhere that Sarkozy&#039;s people were surveilling DSK, the first few sentences appear quite careless.

I have not read the book, but I am pretty sure no such evidence is presented in it, having read an in-depth interview with Epstein on the occasion of its publication.

		<description><![CDATA[At yesterday&#039;s debate between the French Presidential contenders,  Sarkozy was trying to squeeze as much out from the DSK situation for political advantage...

From the Times&#039; liveblog:

But that high-minded discussion quickly descended into crosstalk and a return to accusations of guilt-by-association that marked the debate&#039;s beginning.

&quot;No lessons from the political party that united behind Dominique Strauss-Kahn,&quot; Mr. Sarkozy said.

Mr. Hollande responded by observing that Mr. Sarkozy had appointed Mr. Strauss-Kahn to the International Monetary Fund.

All the best to set you up, my dear...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Every couple of months, there&#039;s a story about how police pulled over a car for a burned-out taillight and &quot;happened&quot; to find millions in drugs in the car. 

I&#039;ve always assumed those are actually illegal cellphone wiretap/warrantless search cases. 

BTW, look for many more of these cases shortly, as the FAA is about to be forced to give all police depts the right to fly quiet, unmanned surveillance drones everywhere, 24/7, without a warrant. Yep, only a few days before your local Chief Billy Bob has his own swarm of the things.
