		<description><![CDATA[Seth, second month of this didn&#039;t go so well, details here:

http://johnlawrenceaspden.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/shangri-la-diet-fail-but-interestingly.html

I think I&#039;m using the wrong types of oil. Do you have any specific recommendations for a particular brand that I&#039;d be able to get hold of in England? I&#039;d be quite happy to order it from America if necessary. This is interesting.

Any other advice/tips also much appreciated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sauerkraut: I will never ever cease to be amazed how some countries treat some foods like WMDs (or worse). This reminds me to go to our local market where a local sells home-made sauerkraut from a vat almost the way it was sold for hundreds of years http://static.etrend.sk/uploads/tx_media/2007/01/22_Rac03.jpg. And then stop by a farmer to grab a bottle of raw milk to have a healthy sip!

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,  can&#039;t imagine how you found my little blog. Sorry if you took any diss from it. You must admit your diet sounds like a (genius) hoax from a standing start!

But the combination of actually feeling it working and reading your clear explanations and justifications of the theory have brought me round as far as &#039;A good idea, not proven&#039;.

I&#039;d seriously like it to be true though. Not just for me (I&#039;m usually slightly overweight) but for all the poor fat people in the world who are made extra miserable by idiots telling them it&#039;s their fault.

The weak spot in the theory to me looks like &#039;set point adjusting to lack of flavours&#039;. I can&#039;t imagine why it would work that way.

I can imagine some poor caveman starving to death because last Tuesday he couldn&#039;t finish his plate of mammoth and now it&#039;s gone off! Surely he&#039;d be well advised to eat everything he can get his hands on in mid-winter.

Evolution does seem to come up with some spectacularly crap mechanisms, but control of appetite must be very ancient, and you&#039;d think it properly debugged by now.

Also, I get the impression that your diet just doesn&#039;t work for some people, so there must be some pieces of the puzzle still to put in, even if the theory&#039;s basically right.

Why the hell has there not been any large-scale independent controlled experiment on this? The effect seems obvious, large, testable and Nobel-prize worthy.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;The weak spot in the theory to me looks like ‘set point adjusting to lack of flavours’. I can’t imagine why it would work that way&quot;. My explanation: The weight control system uses the strength of smell-calorie associations to judge the abundance of food. When food is abundant, we eat food that tastes better (= stronger smell-calorie association) than when food is scarce. Zero smell-calorie association is treated as close to weak smell-calorie association. When food is scarce is when your set point should go down, just as when you are unemployed is when you should spend money in your bank account.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s another article that I found to be interesting:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://mindhacks.com/2012/08/11/a-very-modern-trauma/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A very modern trauma&lt;/a&gt;

It&#039;s a blog post about some new studies about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The studies suggest that this is a modern disease (soldiers from the American Civil War didn&#039;t seem to get it, for example).]]></description>
