		<description><![CDATA[Hey there. Why did you shut down the discussion about Canker Sores. I wanted to see if Heidi from Canada found her cure. I have had Canker Sores for a decade, 2-3 large ones at a time. Then I went vegan and suddenly POOF they were gone for 2 months. But now they are back. Smaller and less frequent. I did accidentally have Walnuts and Flaxseed oil in my diet. Maybe I need to increase them.

What is confusing is some sites say Walnuts cause canker sores. Maybe it is just an allergic reaction some people might have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Japanese aren&#039;t the healthiest people in the world.  They have extremely high incidence of hemmorhagic stroke, one of the most terrible conditions imaginable, and very high incidence of digestive cancers.  Japanese male life expectancy is lower than male life expectancy in Switzerland, Iceland, and Israel.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Thanks for the correction -- if it is true that the Japanese (male and female together) do not have the longest life expectancy in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Seth, have you any views on these remarks about rice?

&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: It reminds me of what a friend said: &quot;If rice were so bad for us, the Japanese wouldn&#039;t be the healthiest people in the world.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if people who collect one thing obsessively sneer at the fanatical collectors of another. &quot;Spending all my money on King George coffee mugs is one thing but wasting thousands of vintage striptease costumes? That&#039;s &lt;i&gt;weird&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I dare say that a Nobel prizes goes, from time to time,  to what used to be known as an &quot;operator&quot;.

Since learned societies presumably increasingly fill up with &quot;operators&quot; (consider the state of the Royal Society), what is to be done?  Surely few Real McCoy scientists would want to spend their energy and time on crusades to put things right?]]></description>
