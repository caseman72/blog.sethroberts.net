		<description><![CDATA[The same passage Adam quoted above in the psychiatrist&#039;s article stood out in blinking neon for me as well. This is precisely why I have found personal science such an important component of tackling my kids&#039; autism. Reading you, Seth, opened my eyes to the possibilities. Life is one big experiment now. Thank you, Seth!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post there by the Psychiatrist.

&quot;Without ducking responsibility, what&#039;s wrong with medicine today is that it is predicated on providing treatment, not on reducing suffering.  Not on solving problems.

The reason it never occurred to me to use the mirror is because the mirror is not something doctors do.  Never mind it is fairly safe.  What we do is offer treatments.  Medications.  Procedures.  Not *maneuvers*.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read Ramachandran&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Phantoms in the Brain&lt;/i&gt; book: absolutely fascinating but the technical portions were very heavy going.

The comments in the psychiatrist&#039;s blog point to a likely reason for his not thinking of using the mirror technique: if he tries it and it doesn&#039;t work, then he&#039;s labelled &#039;altie woo-type&#039;, the patient might complain about his unorthodoxy, etc. Malpractice suits hang over every doctor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The article about the human microbiome is interesting. If more people -- and especially doctors -- understood the importance of the bacteria that have co-evolved with humans and other mammals, there would be much less use of drugs that disrupt our gut microflora.

Two examples:

1. ANTIBIOTICS devastate our good intestinal bacteria, and thus often create opportunities for drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria to colonize (colon-ize) our bowels.

2. ANTACIDS AND PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (Nexium,for example) reduce the stomach acids which begin the digestive process and kill harmful bacteria. The result is that bad bacteria and undigested food get to the intestines, causing chaos.

Doctors, who needs them? Well, maybe the millions of people who doctors have gotten addicted to painkillers.]]></description>
