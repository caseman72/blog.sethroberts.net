		<description><![CDATA[Epstein&#039;s idea that Zakaria did not plagiarize is a bit of a stretch. If anything, what Zakaria did was even more cynical, since what he did was a widely known Internet method called &quot;spinning&quot;. In spinning, individual words are swapped with their synonyms to proactively foil Google searches (which only detect identical text strings):

newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2012/08/10/talk-about-concealed-carry-fareed-zakaria-plagiarized-paragraph-history-

In other words, Zakarias is not just copying, he&#039;s consciously attempting to destroy the evidence at the same time. 

It&#039;s pretty cynical, and when you compare the passages (which Epstein &lt;i&gt;doesn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; show, making it harder for readers to check his &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; work, ironically making his own article disingenuous for similar reasons), undeniable.

Also, it&#039;s a little unfair to suggest Zakaria did it to improve Lepore&#039;s &quot;banal&quot; writing. &quot;Banal&quot; writing is not improved by spinning, as the sequence and structure of ideas (and, in fact, the ideas themselves) remain identical.

He didn&#039;t do it to improve her work. He did it to steal it.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m not saying Zakaria improved anything. I don&#039;t think Zakaria tried to &quot;destroy evidence&quot; -- I think he thought it hardly mattered how the basic facts, which he properly credited, were laid out. You can&#039;t &quot;steal&quot; something that is worthless, which I think is a reasonably close description of how much Lepore added to what her source said (i.e., she added almost nothing). Yes, Epstein should have shown the two passages. But I agree with his big point. Zakaria is being punished for changing an insufficient number of words. Like Epstein, I disagree that this deserves the punishment that Zakaria is getting. Let&#039;s say I write &quot;saturated fat is bad for you&quot;. Sure, I copied this from someone else. Should I be punished for not giving a source? I don&#039;t think so. It&#039;s a banality. The mainstream media commit major crimes every day -- the way they trust self-interested experts who grossly distort the truth. To ignore those major crimes and focus on this trivial crime is yet another sign of how poorly the media police themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
