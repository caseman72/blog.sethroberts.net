		<description><![CDATA[The same doctor mentioned in the article above also said &#039;It may also be that certain bacteria in the bowel normally break down the oxalate, but that these bacteria may disappear, perhaps after a course of antibiotics. There must be genetic factors, too, as fibromylagia is more common among families of those affected.&#039;

Yesterday, I came across an article stating that gut bacteria are altered during pregnancy (apparently to increase insulin resistance so that the baby gets more glucose) and this alteration is retained. This might explain why more women end up with fibromyalgia - and why more women can never shed their &#039;baby&#039; weight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the main antibiotics that destroys Oxalobacter formigenes in the gut is Augmentin - commonly prescribed with a PPI to enable you to &#039;tolerate&#039; it. No wonder you can end up with oxalate overload afterwards. 

The Paleo diet is &#039;half-way&#039; to the low-oxalate diet, which probably explains why many people  get improvements but not quite full health on the paleo. As  a gluten-abstaining coeliac, who still has fibromyalgia, I will definitely try modifying my diet to see if I can remove the fibromyalgia. I would like to get fit without severe pain all the time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps the important lesson is that wittering  about &quot;healthy eating&quot; is pointless if the advisee doesn&#039;t know what is healthy for her.

(It&#039;s easier for men, who know that sausages are healthy for them.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some common foods high in Oxalate are &quot;SCRT&quot;:

Spinach
Chocolate
Rhubarb 
Tea

I believe Fibromyalgia is more common in women &amp; there is at least an old wives&#039; tale that women eat more chocolate than men. Maybe I&#039;m grasping at straws here.

Anyway, rather than cutting out ALL vegetables, maybe a 1st approach would be to cut out these big 4 and see if there is improvement? If so, then one might consider further reducing other sources.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a little bit of amateur web searching turned up articles about Oxalobacter formigenes, which is a beneficial oxalate-degrading bacterium commonly found in the human gut. However, it can be destroyed by antibiotics, and perhaps indirectly by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a result of protein pump inhibitors.

So, quit the antibiotics, quit the PPIs, take some yogurt and other probiotics, and keep eating lots of fruits and veggies that provide fiber for your good gut bacteria,

But I ain&#039;t no doctor. I&#039;m just a cranky old patient. So I don&#039;t give (or take) medical advice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Apparently she is the first person to make the connection.&quot;  I suppose that rules her out for the Nobel in medicine/physiology, then?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Since I wrote that I am no longer sure she is the first. A low-oxalate diet is promoted for various disorders, I learned, although apparently never in the PubMed literature. But, yeah, it&#039;s been a long time since anyone resembling an ordinary doctor, which she is, has won a Nobel Prize in medicine/physiology.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
