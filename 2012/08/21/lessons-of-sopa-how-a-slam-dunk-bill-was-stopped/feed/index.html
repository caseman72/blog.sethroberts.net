		<description><![CDATA[Lobbyists are always in favor of a bigger, more intrusive, more activist, and more interventionist state, since that is more money in their pockets, even though it is often less money in the pockets of their clients.

Lobbyists are excessively cozy with the state.  Let us suppose you are a big business that employs a team of lobbyists.  Chances are Senator big shot will call up your lobbyists, and ask &quot;what most terrifies your biggest paying customers.  What could plausibly pass, and create the most horrifying ruin and destruction for them.  They will tell him.  He will then introduce the bill, in order to get paid off for it not passing.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: In this particular case, you could say the lobbyists believed that only tweaking was possible because that is the main thing lobbyists are paid for.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Passage of SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) seemed inevitable. It was introduced with 40 Senate co-sponsors, including plenty of both Republicans and Democrats. (At the time it was called PIPA — Protect IP Act.) Senate passage requires 51 votes; to override a filibuster you need more. The entertainment industry (Hollywood) had spent hundreds of millions of dollars per year to pass such a bill; the people behind the lobbying felt the survival of their industry was at stake. Senator Patrick Leahy, whose office wrote the bill, is in the new Batman movie.&quot;

This is incorrect.

SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) was introduced by Lamar Smith to the House of Representatives.  PIPA (PROTECT IP Act) was introduced to the Senate by Patrick Leahy.

Two completely different bills, both introduce at nearly the same time and both attempting to accomplish the same thing.  Pretty much the rest is correct though, it had bi-partisan support (SOPA introduced by a Republican and PIPA by a Democrat).
