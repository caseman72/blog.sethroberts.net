		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you wrote: &quot;I measure daily: 1. weight. 2. fasting blood sugar. 3. sleep. 4. brain function. It takes about 7 minutes.&quot;

1. is obvious.
2. I&#039;m interested in, but a Glucometer is expensive. Are you testing only once a day? When do you test?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I test once/day at 8 am.&lt;/strong&gt;

3. I&#039;ve heard you describe before. You record your subjective feeling of restedness on a scale from 0 to 100, including decimals (ie 97.5).
4. You test with solving arithmetic in some program. Any chance you could share the details if not the program itself?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I will soon announce a way that a small number of people can use the test I now use. I  no longer use an arithmetic test.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post. Ever consider posting some of the templates you use for self-tracking?

Regarding one-legged standing, I&#039;ve been doing it for a few days now and am getting restorative sleep that I have rarely had since childhood, where I was on my feet for a large chunk of the day playing. I wonder why I didn&#039;t think of doing something so simple on my own; clearly it would have  helped to have used a journal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that data accumulation is a rare way to do science, and there should be more of it.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Data accumulation is common. Outlier investigation is rare.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard about that sort of neutral accumulation of data in studying nature-- there are projects that keep track of bird-watching results. I&#039;ve heard of another project of that sort done by scientists-- I&#039;ll post if I remember any more details.

The Longevity Project is probably another one.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Many scientific projects collect data over long periods of time (years). In psychology this is called longitudinal research. In psychology at least, the people who do these studies don&#039;t try to learn the cause of sudden changes (if any). In what I&#039;ve seen, they ignore them. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, Im sorry, but I&#039;m still a skeptic about your butter-arithmetic hypothesis, and your assertion that consuming butter makes you feel better.

In one of the Public Library of Science blogs, &quot;Obesity Panacea,&quot; a recent post called &quot;Does thinking hard impact your heart?&quot; made this statement:

&quot;The results of this study suggest that an experimental mental work condition consisting of a 45-min period of reading and writing a summary, as other types of mental work (such as arithmetic) utilized in the laboratory, can modulate cardiovascular responses in healthy young adults through a reduction in cardiac parasympathetic activity.&quot;

In other words, perhaps it is the mental work (arithmetic), not the butter, which makes you feel good. (But my long-ago calculus class at Duke in 1961-62 sure didn&#039;t make me feel good. And the grade I got really made me feel bad.)

http://blogs.plos.org/obesitypanacea/2012/08/09/does-thinking-hard-impact-your-heart/
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: I believe butter makes me faster at arithmetic. From your comment I am unable to figure out why you question this. I have not studied mood effects of butter.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested in self-tracking, but I haven&#039;t figured out HOW to do it (without it being too cumbersome / time consuming / inconvenient).  Is there something you&#039;ve written (or someone else has written) that gives tips to a beginner?  I imagine you&#039;ve learned a lot over years of doing this about what makes it easy enough to stick to.  

When you suggest that one measure something daily, then wait and see ... well, I&#039;m trying to think about what sorts of things are likely to be worth measuring.  I guess that depends on the individual, and what issues/problems they&#039;d like to improve.  Sleep and mood are clearly useful ones.  Weight too....  But I&#039;m curious - what do YOU measure daily?  And - about how much time does your self-tracking take (not analyzing / making connections, just the stuff you record each day)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Getting taken seriously when I do any self-tracking is an uphill battle when I&#039;m dealing with arrogant jerks in long white coats (a.k.a. MDs).

They dismiss my experiences as anecdotal, and if I don&#039;t slavishly follow their &quot;doctor&#039;s orders,&quot; they call me noncompliant, nonadherent, crazy, and suicidal.

At that point, I have a name for them.

I call them my ex-doctors.

An arrogant jerk is still an arrogant jerk, even if the jerk wears a long white coat.]]></description>
