		<description><![CDATA[I found that 5000 IU in the morning eliminates my restless sleep and makes falling asleep much easier.  Originally I was at 7000 IU, and dropped it to 4000.  I went to a conference and took only 2000 IU every morning.  What a mistake.  restless sleep came right back.  Got home and increased back to 5000.  Time of morning appears to be somewhat irrelevant to me.  Sometimes I take it at 6am, usually between 7 and 8, sometimes as late as 9am.  9am may well be associated with decreased sleep quality, but 6-8am are not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife has had recent good luck with D3, but I have had much better sleep with one ibuprofen.  For some reason I am sleeping 30-60 minutes longer and having way more dreams. Anybody else have similar experiences?

		<description><![CDATA[I think it would be interesting whether &quot;in the morning mean the same thing for everyone.

There are people who get up at 5 o&#039; clock and there are people who get up at 11 o&#039; clock.
Maybe the 11 o&#039;clock people don&#039;t get the full benefits of taking vitamin D3 after awakening?
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: I agree. My experience has been that I needed to try a range of different morning times (from about 6 am to 9 am) to find the time that worked best. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have slept very badly for many years.  It is hard to get to sleep and then I wake up often.  I also have sleep apnea, for which I use a CPAP machine while sleeping, which doesn&#039;t help because if the pressurizing mask slips it may leak, which tends to wake me up.

I&#039;ve been taking 4000 units/day of D3 in the morning after reading about it here.  It does help, but only modestly.  But what I do notice is that I tend to get very sleepy about 12 - 13 hours after taking the D3.  I don&#039;t necessarily fall asleep easily or sleep better if I go to bed at this time, though sometimes I get so sleepy I can&#039;t do much else besides lie down.  This period of sleepiness seems to last for a few hours.  If I get through it, I wake up enough to function all right until I go to bed.  If I have gotten through the sleepy period in the evening,  I will generally sleep about as well as if I had gone to bed earlier during the sleepy time.

The effect will last for one or two more days if I omit taking the D3.  Sometimes I adjust the time I take the D3 according to what I may be doing in the evening, such as being at a concert or driving home, to try to avoid getting to sleepy at the wrong time.  That&#039;s only partly successful.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You might want to try a range of morning times to find what works best. I noticed that taking Vitamin D3 at 7 am had a much better effect than taking it at 8 am.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
