		<description><![CDATA[I had a similar experience.  I suffered from migraines, frequent sinus infections, anxiety, heartburn and IBS symptoms my entire life.  I guess I always thought this was the normal state, because my mother had the same problems.   In February of this year, I did a 30 day Paleo challenge and eliminated all grains.  Within a week, my chronic sinus congestion had disappeared, my digestive symptoms were gone, and I have not had an anxiety attack or a migraine in the past six months since continuing to avoid gluten.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not an &quot;anti-doctor&quot; or &quot;corporations are evil&quot; type, but I really feel like the entire industry has been co-opted by the pharmaceutical companies.  It seems like any time you go to a doctor, the first and only option they even consider is some kind of drug.  Food, lifestyle, and vitamins don&#039;t even enter the discussion, and if you bring it up, they practically laugh it off.

I research canker sores and the whole reason I do so is because I&#039;ve had them my whole life and pretty much the most information I got from a doctor or dentist was, &quot;Yeah, that happens to some people.&quot;  I&#039;ve had great success with Vitamin B12, and when I mention that to doctors, I usually just get a smirk and they pass it off as placebo.  A placebo that doesn&#039;t work with any of the other supplements I&#039;ve taken for some reason.

It&#039;s a shame that this side of healthcare gets so ignored.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Great post! I used to wake up every morning unrested and exhausted due to sinus inflamation. I thought the cause of the inflammation was due to environmental factors like dust, pollen, etc. This was not the cause! Ive been wheat free for three weeks now and I wake up every morning rested and not struggling to breath. Amazing that the source of my sinus inflammation was from wheat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Same with me. I have been wheat free for over two years. I recently realized, I have not had a migraine in a long time, probably two years. I used to get them every month or so. 

Now it is a great excuse for not eating all the wheat I am offered, instead of an amorphous claim of trying to eat better. I tell them my doctor told me to do it and it has stopped my migraines.

Also, since I stopped the wheat:
Pre-diabetic symptoms - gone.
Seasonal allergies- almost completely gone.
Sinus infections- very rare, used to be regular.
Stomach aches, heartburn- very rare, used to be common.
Soreness after working out is drastically reduced.
I could list things all day that are better.]]></description>

Seriously though, Brent Pottenger also banished the migraines that plagued him most of his adolescent and early adult life by giving up grains, especially wheat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My blocked sinuses are made worse by citrus fruit.  Dreadful shame - I love freshly squeezed orange juice, but there you are.  But I&#039;m not so sensitive that I&#039;ve had to give up G &amp; T.

In my fifties I became intolerant to Brazil nuts and (I now suspect) hazels.  Fortunately almonds are OK.]]></description>
