		<description><![CDATA[People use diet to overcome some of their ailments, but give up on dairy intolerance? I mentioned oestrogen inhibiting lactase in a previous comment, and it seems progesterone can do the opposite. Bacteria in the small intestine are also very efficient at inhibiting lactase. I&#039;m sure there are many other factors than these three. 

Dr. Ayers talks about the importance of bacteria with lactose-digesting gene clusters, and some of his readers have overcome dairy intolerance by carefully consuming kefir and other LAB-containing foods. Those Peat-arians don&#039;t seem to have too much trouble overcoming it when they try either. 

I&#039;m starting to translate &quot;taking dairy out improved my acne&quot; to &quot;my diet sucks and my GI tract looks as good as my face during a breakout.&quot; I&#039;m sure I could be wrong, but it definitely doesn&#039;t seem clear cut, and pizza was mentioned more than once in those comments. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a case for demonising dairy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently took the expensive ALCAT food &quot;intolerance&quot; test. So did a friend. We were each given a list of foods to avoid - completely different lists - and both of us have found some relief from our symptoms.

Each of us is complex and unique, and only individualized testing (whether self-testing or a commercial battery of tests) can help us figure out the optimal path for ourselves. For one person it&#039;s drinking pork fat and avoiding milk - for another, it could be the opposite. 

Can we generalize at all? Smoking, mercury, and beefy running shoes: suboptimal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As one commenter says, &quot;I suspect there isn&#039;t a one-size-fits-all solution to acne anyway.&quot;  That seems a very sensible, obvious point.  Walk around any American city and you&#039;ll see a huge variety in people&#039;s faces:  skin/hair color, the shapes of their eyes, noses, mouths.  I don&#039;t see any reason why that wide individual variability wouldn&#039;t also extend to food sensitivities.

Nobody mentions food combinations.  Personally, I don&#039;t have noticeable breakouts with wheat or dairy on their own, but eaten together (pizza, buttered waffles) they almost always give me trouble.  My theory is that the butter makes my skin oilier, while the wheat has some inflammatory effects that obstruct the oil secretion pathways.]]></description>
