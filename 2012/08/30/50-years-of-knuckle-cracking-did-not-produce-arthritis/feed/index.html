		<description><![CDATA[As a very ordinary person, with access to the extraordinary Internet, I could google &quot;Donald L. Unger.&quot;  There I would find a couple of stories that indicate the project was indeed real and not a joke.

Probably should have done that before I commented :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

You&#039;re right.  I don&#039;t know whether the 50-year &quot;self-controlled study&quot; actually happened or not.  It&#039;s certainly not impossible but fifty years of one-sided knuckle cracking seemed unlikely to me.  The letter and response read like satire to me.  The response is certainly satire, especially the &quot;statistical analysis&quot; of Dr. John Adams, e.g., &quot;Typically, sample sizes of roughly twice the available research budget are required for valid inference.&quot; (Not seeing a journal name at the top or bottom of either page also made me suspicious.)

If I had access to a medical library, I would see if the cited 1973 article actually exists (I&#039;m so ignorant I don&#039;t even know if there was a Western Journal of Medicine in 1973).  If I was a hot shot Berkeley Psychology Professor, I&#039;d call Dr. Unger and ask him personally whether the letter described something that had actually happened or was &quot;a joke.&quot;  

It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; funny.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unger&#039;s letter is light-hearted and whimsical (&quot;spinach-eating&quot;!) and the authors of the previous study answered in kind. So in a way it is a joke, on both their parts. More like a case study so of course it&#039;s statistically &#039;underpowered&#039;.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;Joke&quot; usually means &quot;didn&#039;t actually happen&quot; (&quot;I was joking!&quot;). I see nothing to suggest that what Unger described didn&#039;t actually happen. In fact, I believe Unger -- like most of us -- is not creative enough to make such stuff up.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This whole thing is, of course, a joke.  It is one of the recipients of the 2009 Ig-Nobel Prizes.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Calling someone&#039;s 50-year project &quot;a joke&quot; is not terribly nice. What do you mean by &quot;a joke&quot; and how do you know it is &quot;a joke&quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

BTW, the reply to Unger&#039;s letter is funny &amp; worth reading.

		<description><![CDATA[The National Institute of Health website has links to many published studies which show little or no harm from long-term knuckle cracking.

However, according to a 1990 report (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1004074/):
&quot;Habitual knuckle cracking was associated with manual labour, biting of the nails, smoking, and drinking alcohol.&quot;

Just wondering: Does Donald Unger drink, smoke, bite his nails, or do manual labor?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Unger&#039;s study was better controlled than any of the NIH studies, in the sense that the hands being compared were identical in terms of diet and genetics.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
