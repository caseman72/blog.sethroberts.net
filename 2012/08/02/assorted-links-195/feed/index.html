		<description><![CDATA[The fake Bagel Company was interesting. The vast majority of &quot;likes&quot; came from Egypt, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Maybe Facebook is so new for these people that they click the Like button to indicate &quot;I have read it&quot;. Probably a lot of it is simply, &quot;It was written in English but I understood it!&quot;

Notice that he got almost no response from English-speaking countries.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen psoriasis apparently cured by a vitamin-D/K combo. Sunlight by itself helped but did not tame it. (Self-diagnosis, never went to a doctor about it. Using the Thorne Research D/K2 droplets and I&#039;m curious if anyone else has seen this effect. Vitamin D by itself didn&#039;t do it either.)

This jibes with the article where he attributes it to green veggies, which tend to have K.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The cessation of psoriasis was probably a function of ceasing to eat wheat, rather than of losing weight...

&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21654830&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Psoriasis in a nationwide cohort study of patients with celiac disease.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;

&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18384553&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Serologic markers of celiac disease in psoriatic patients.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;

Lots of mystery skin ailments seem to be caused by wheat consumption, not just dermatitis herpetiformis.  What&#039;s interesting is the excema, they&#039;re now finding, is caused by a breakdown in the tight junctions of the skin.  Celiac&#039;s hallmark is the breakdown of tight junctions in the intestine, but obviously it can also affect the skin, since dermatitis herpetiformis = celiac disease.

It will be interesting to see what the mechanisms turn out to be for non-celiac gluten sensitivity...]]></description>
