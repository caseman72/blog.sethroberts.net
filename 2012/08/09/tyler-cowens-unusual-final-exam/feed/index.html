		<description><![CDATA[A few years ago, i was all over the UK papers (some positive, most negative) and had a 2 page spread in THE after doing this; in a more structured way though. Look up &quot;lecturer lets students set own exam&quot; on Google for the media coverage. It worked well as a pedagogic exercise/experiment in assessment for learning. As a PR disaster for my institution, it wasnt quite so good; the first act of the newly appointed VC was to make a statement supporting me on academic grounds, which I&#039;m sure he wasn&#039;t pleased about. I even had a poison pen letter from a Daily Mail reader, and lost out at a subsequent job interview when it was raised :-(

Oh well…

		<description><![CDATA[I once taught an upper division course.  At the beginning of the course I handed out 100 questions.  I told the students we will cover the answers to all 100 questions in the course.  Further, each student will have 10 questions randomly chosen from the list of 100 questions on his Final Exam.  I did not grade on a curve and I told them they could all get A&#039;s or everyone could Fail.  Surprisingly, the grade distribution was not different from the other courses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the 1960&#039;s a Harvard chemistry professor posed a question on a chemistry final examination along these lines:

10% Extra Credit.  Write a question to be used as an extra credit question on a final examination in chemistry.  The ideal extra credit question should be worth about 10% of the grade on the examination as a whole, and test facility with the material covered during the course.

My friend Tom Hervey received full credit with the following answer:

		<description><![CDATA[One result of this strategy is that every student will be correct in their prediction of what will be on the exam. Regardless of which material is actually most important, if a student believes X, Y, and Z will be on the exam, she will study X, Y, and Z. Faced with an open-ended exam, she will write on what she has studied, namely X, Y, and Z.

Or, in principle, another thing that might happen is that a student might write and answer a bunch of suitably difficult questions all rooted in materials from the last half of the course. That would lead to a high grade, despite ignoring (and perhaps being ignorant of) half the material. So, yes, additional constraints would be wise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I sat an International Political Economy exam (set by the excellent Alex Coram) in which the final question was &quot;Write a question you wish had been in this exam, and answer it&quot;. As I recall some students didn&#039;t appreciate that opportunity as much as I did.

I think the approach is useful in that it rewards understanding rather than regurgitation, and that it contains a meta-question that is something like: which are the important topics in this course?]]></description>
