		<description><![CDATA[Seth, are you then skeptical of the arguments that Steven Pinker presents in his book, &lt;i&gt;The Blank Slate&lt;/i&gt;?  (He argues that your parents have surprisingly little influence on your character [aside from supplying your genes].)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, I am skeptical of both books -- Pinker and Gladwell (or rather the woman, Judith Harris, that Gladwell writes about).&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm &quot;“They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They don’t mean to but they do…” He wasn’t joking.&quot;
He wasn&#039;t a scientist either, argument from poetry isn&#039;t one of the classic fallacies but it ought to be.

Hmm &quot;Parents control the environment.&quot; 
Not really, sure they are an important influence, reducing as children grow up, but school, TV and the peer group are also important influences so that &#039;control&#039; is not the word.

&quot;...parents don’t know what the right environment is.&quot;
For sure, but who does ? Maybe different children thrive best with different parenting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes that opening line resonates! I think it is my own bias to attribute people&#039;s successes to their own efforts (and fortuitous circumstances) whereas I&#039;m more likey to think &quot;bad parents&quot; when they are, for want of a better term, fucked up. In my own family, we have one set of parents but wildy WILDY different outcomes for the siblings... from prison to medicine and investment banking. It is hard to not be overly influenced by such data points when they are so close to home.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why do I admire her parents? There is a famous poem by Philip Larkin that begins &quot;They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They don&#039;t mean to but they do...&quot; He wasn&#039;t joking. I am utterly sure there are many ways to raise children that omit important things (which might include periods of independence and stress) and cause those children to be less effective and happy adults than they otherwise would have been. Anybody who thinks that genetics ever acts by itself -- in the absence of the right environment -- understands very little about development. Parents control the environment. A study that suggests &quot;parents don&#039;t matter&quot; may simply be showing that parents don&#039;t know what the right environment is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious - why do you think her character is the result of how her parents raised her? The people I know who are the most resourceful have been those who, essentially, raised themselves without much parental involvement (not that my experience is in any way representative of the wider population). 

But even if we were to credit the parents, was it their genes or upbringing? Sorry to trot out this old question but I do find it odd that you left with, above all things, admiration for her parents.]]></description>
