		<description><![CDATA[The few scientists at the FDA who have the courage and conviction to report questionable practices in their agency now have their email monitoring. The whistle-blower act, which is supposed to protect government employees against reprisal for reporting illegal and dangerous practices at any agency is ineffective. Management and supervisors manipulate the system against whistle blowers, often leading to job loss.

I suppose these federal employees ought to resort to the US Postal Service to deliver their concerns to members of congress.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have long wondered at the odd but common assumption on blogs that only American trials count - it hadn&#039;t occurred to me that it carried the force of law.   It would be far more sensible for the US to combine European data with US data taken on blacks and mestizos (spelling?) - that way you&#039;d have a better chance of getting studies with enough of those two racial groups to give them some reasonable assurance of safety.

In fact, you could argue that the present US system carries needless risk for those two groups in particular.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, it&#039;s known as &quot;regulatory capture&quot;.  It&#039;s one of the primary criticisms of government regulatory efforts:

&quot;Alternatively, it may be better to not create a given agency at all lest the agency become victim, in which case it may serve its regulated subjects rather than those whom the agency was designed to protect. A captured regulatory agency is often worse than no regulation, because it wields the authority of government. However, increased transparency of the agency may mitigate the effects of capture.&quot;

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture

I did a post about this a while ago.  One of the reasons the FDA was created was to prevent adulterants like sawdust (primarily composed of cellulose) from being added to foods.  Now, the FDA actively promotes adding cellulose to foods, at the prompting of industry.  The FDA&#039;s not on the consumer&#039;s side any more.  And it resists all efforts at transparency.
