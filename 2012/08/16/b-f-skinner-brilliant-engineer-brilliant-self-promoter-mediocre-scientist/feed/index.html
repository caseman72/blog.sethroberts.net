		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Skinner ignored data about punishment&quot;
This is undoubtedly true, Skinner&#039;s theory of punishment did not hold up. However, his work did inspire people to re-examine the use of punishment and to try to avoid it when possible. 

For a good examination of Skinner&#039;s work see the text book: Introduction to Learning and Behavior [Russell A. Powell,Diane G. Symbaluk,P. Lynne Honey}]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I must say &quot;Bravo!&quot;. For reasons unknown (or at least unsaid), it requires an uncommon degree of insight and honesty to voice this sort of criticism.

Could you please do the same with Chomsky? He is even more deserving if possible as his tour de force has been far, far more duplicitous, devastating, fallacious, opportunistic, and, ultimately, inane.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. Yeah, I feel the same about Chomsky as I do about Skinner, minus the brilliant engineer aspect. But I am not a linguistics professor and know far less about him. So I am not very qualified to comment.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I agree with many of your criticisms of Skinner I think your characterization of him as a charlatan is too harsh. Skinner did make real contributions to psychology, he framed operant behavior in a useful way and he provided an important critique of punishment that helped to reduce the use of punishment in schools and in the treatment of people with mental illness. Many techniques derived from operant approaches remain useful in education and therapy

Although flawed I think Beyond Freedom and Dignity and Walden II are fascinating challenging books well worth reading.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree that Skinner made real contributions to psychology: the Skinner box and cases where behavior analysis works, such as autism. I call that engineering. My graduate school advisor, Russ Church, who did a great deal of research about punishment, told me that Skinner ignored data about punishment that did not fit his beliefs. And continued to espouse those beliefs.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If your child is autistic, you are in crisis.&quot;

Yes.

&quot;You have zero interest in questions about “cause” — you simply want help.&quot;

Well, sort of. You figure out really quickly that not many people can help much. But if I had good theories about cause I could use those to design interventions on my own.

Somehow I&#039;ve missed on behavior analysis for autism. I will have to look at it. We&#039;ve got some behaviors at home that need, shall we say, meliorated. :-) Thanks for posting on that.]]></description>
