		<description><![CDATA[Horrifying is the right word.  This quote speaks volumes:

“We’ve decided as a society that it’s too expensive to modify the kid’s environment. So we have to modify the kid.”

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;As a society&quot;? I wonder. Professors who can do research think it is higher-status to study high-tech stuff like drugs than low-tech stuff like food. (Curiously there is more money to study the high-status stuff, we&#039;re taught that rarity increases status.) Maybe this is human nature (as Veblen argued), maybe it is promoted by science journalists who never call them on this. Since Veblen found the same pattern (less useful = higher status) in many societies and cultures, it isn&#039;t clear it is a society&#039;s &quot;decision&quot;. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth.

Thanks for the blog. Keeps me learning.

I like the links posts, but can you give a bit more description (Jacobs v Roberts?) + set up the links to open in separate windows?

Easier to navigate your post while deciding whether to follow the link.

Barry Ritholz is a good example: http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/10/10-tuesday-am-reads-42/

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, I didn&#039;t know about how to cause links to open in separate windows. Now I do.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That New York Times story about the drugging of America&#039;s children is scary.

Drug companies and doctors already have saturated the adult market and turned countless millions of adults into  drug addicts dependent on painkillers, antidepressants, and other strange chemicals.

So how can they keep growing their market? Expand the market by getting America&#039;s children addicted, thus creating new generations of drug-consuming zombies.]]></description>
