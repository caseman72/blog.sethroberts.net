		<description><![CDATA[I looked at the medicine Nobels something like two years ago and was puzzled how little positive impact on everyday medicine came from all this brouhaha. A lot of what I call &quot;molecular masturbation&quot;, very fine research no doubt, but with a complete disconnect to finding the causes of the diseases that plague so many of us.

Medicine as a whole seems &quot;stuck&quot; and in dire need of a paradigmatic shift (if not several). So many little and big barriers (&quot;common knowledge&quot; like sat-fat is bad, the many problems with the research and publishing process, or &quot;big pharma&quot;) that hinder progress in the medical sciences. As more and more people are starting to gain personal experience about things that have a positive (or negative!) result on their very own health (personally I think especially the Paleo thing is going good), there will be some in the medical science that will go down the same path. I sometimes wonder when exactly personal experiments came out of fashion in the medical and biological sciences – your blog is surely an shining example that even as an individual one can make some change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Donnall Thomas just passed away. His 1990 Nobel for developing bone marrow transplants was definitely for results, not potential. Have you seen a trend away from that, or do you think it&#039;s always been a mix?

		<description><![CDATA[I admit to my surprise some years ago when I glanced at the rules and saw that they required the work to have brought benefits, because it&#039;s quite obvious that the prizes are routinely awarded for work that might perhaps contribute to benefits at some time - perhaps distant - in the future.

Perhaps it&#039;s just another example of the rule that Pure research always drives out Applied.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think Alfred Nobel included the &quot;have benefits&quot; requirement because he didn&#039;t want to have happen exactly what has happened: Scientists decide among themselves, with no regard for anyone else, what research is best. &quot;I don&#039;t want this prize to make them rich while they continue to do exactly what they want to do,&quot; he thought.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
