		<description><![CDATA[&quot;someone agrees with me that “correlation does not equal causation” is not great wisdom&quot;: then you&#039;re both wrong.  The advice is offered to freshers for good reason.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Correlations are useful. They provide evidence relevant to causation. The saying I disparage says roughly the opposite. How is that helpful?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This Vitamin D study was a poorly done should be ignored. They did not test for blood levels of Vitamin D which is essential as there is huge variation in people&#039;s ability to absorb Vitamin D.

Here is a better study:
A controlled study  of severely Vitamin D deficient women over 50 from Harlem  were randomly selected to be supplemented. One group was supplemented to bring them up to moderately deficient. They had a 60% reduced risk of colds and influenza. Another group were supplemented to bring them up to optimum Vitamin D blood level and they had a 90% reduction in risk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Am I reading it correctly the Vitamin D study recieved 100,000 IU a month?  At once?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes. Here&#039;s a description: &quot;Participants were randomly assigned to receive an initial dose of 200 000 IU oral vitamin D3, then 200 000 IU 1 month later, then 100 000 IU monthly (n = 161), or placebo administered in an identical dosing regimen (n = 161), for a total of 18 months.&quot;An experimental design that assumes that all that matters is the blood level of Vitamin D3&lt; /strong&gt;]]></description>
