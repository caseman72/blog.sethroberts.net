		<description><![CDATA[These are not hidden side effects. These are pretty well known side-effects documented all over literature, especially the join pain and muscle pain. Most of these happen when statins are over-prescribed, i.e. doctors give patients with very high cholesterol more Statin than the recommended dose (the dose that the original safety trials were done). Some people think CoQ10 supplementation could help but the reality is that no body to-date knows for certain the exact reason why statins cause these problems.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You seem to be saying the author of this article made a fool of himself (and opened himself up to charges of incompetence) in Great Britain&#039;s most popular paper.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the big studies of statins hid the side effects as follows.  They gave the drug and the placebo to the two groups.  In the first few weeks of the study many of the subjects suffered side effects so bad that they dropped out.  These people were then obliterated from the statistics and the subsequent boasted-about results for benefits and side effects ignored their existence.

In my little corner of science we&#039;d have called that &quot;lying&quot;.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I didn&#039;t know about that. Because these drugs are so widely prescribed and so profitable and yet have so little apparent benefit -- so little that the side effects could easily be worse than the benefits -- &quot;lying&quot; is a rather weak term for the deception you describe.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
