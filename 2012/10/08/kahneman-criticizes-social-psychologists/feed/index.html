		<description><![CDATA[David,

There have been many, many such well-structured RCTs by retail companies.  They are are generally termed &quot;SKU rationalization&quot; experiments. 

Duncan,

Thanks. I go into this experiment and subsequent analyses in much greater detail in my book published in May. 

Best,
Jim Manzi]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I liked your post a lot. The whole issue of the &quot;sociology of knowledge and social psychology&quot; (and psychology and science generally) and how the kind of &quot;external-to-truth&quot; factors influence what are considered to be findings in psychology needs to be understood much better than it is. There needs to be better access to all the research that more or less fails to replicate important claims. There needs to be systematic research on the research so the field can better clean up its act...

It leaves me rather confused as one who is fascinated by findings in social psychology and tries, a little, to theorize them and integrate them into my daily existence. How seriously should we take important claims? I know one important Asian-American psychologist who has been very skeptical of Bargh as well as other highly publicized findings in psychology...

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: There&#039;s a saying &quot;everyone believes an experiment except the experimenter.&quot; Let me revise it to &quot;everyone believes an experiment except other experimenters&quot; -- who understand how easily the results can be shaped to fit what the experimenter wants.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We should clarify the saying you are using. It&#039;s better stated this way: &quot;a. Fast. b. Cheap. c. Good. Pick any 2.&quot;

At least that&#039;s the software version of it. It expresses our frustrations with management who drive us to produce quickly and cheaply but are horrified to discover that when it&#039;s done it isn&#039;t any good. Or that we could build it cheaply and have it turn out well, but it&#039;s going to take longer. Or that we could build it well, and quickly, but it will cost a lot.

And beat that system the answer is to invest some resources to improve our tooling or our processes.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You mean my statement was confusing because I numbered the choices? I&#039;ve heard the &quot;pick 2&quot; saying in regard to making movies and making physical stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
