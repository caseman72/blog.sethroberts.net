		<description><![CDATA[Some mentioned they hadn&#039;t counted their colds. I have. For the first 58 years of my life, I had one every 4-6 weeks. Then I found I had coeliac disease and stopped eating gluten. Also, my nutritionist put me onto high levels of probiotics for 3 months, and then a maintenance dose, which I take to this day. In the last 7 years, I have had only 4 illnesses! I attribute this to both the lack of gluten (no gut damage) and the probiotics.

Fermented foods are a very effective way of getting probiotics, when you can work out how to make them/get them. These days I have Kefir, and want to experiment with others.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I whole heartily agree with much of what you have said here but I have to pick up on the evolutionary point that we haven&#039;t been prepared to live in cities of 1 million+.

I think you might get better results from asking people how many days they missed work last year to illness.  I get colds but I shrug them off so fast and they are so mild that I haven&#039;t missed a day of work to illness in 5 years.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, missed days of work is a good question. And you make a good point about cities of 1 million. In the past ten years I think all of my colds appear to have come from the combination of (a) poor sleep and (b) riding crowded public transit.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rashad: I suspect that in most cases food poisoning is actually more about toxins than microbes - ie, it&#039;s the nasty chemicals the bacteria made before you ate them, not the bacteria themselves. It&#039;s also the case what we think of as food poisoning symptoms are actually immune responses, and if we want to measure immune system strength we should be looking at who&#039;s sick two days later. I also suspect that when people go to developing countries, their immune systems start having false positives: they fire in response to things that are actually harmless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although one counter-example I just thought of is eating street food in a new developing country. Usually after the first illness or two the body adjusts, although when I lived in Egypt I knew several people that never did and just couldn&#039;t eat street food, so maybe they had weaker immune function?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, the other thing to take into account is potency of the disease vector. Obviously most of the time we are exposed to a cold, we don&#039;t get sick, so immune function plays a huge role there. However for a lot of the things that go via the fecal-oral route, I think there are much higher rates of infection, hence less variance due to the immune system. For example, with food poisoning, my anecdotal experience is that if you eat the thing that is poisoned, you will get sick, with several instances of shared sickness across multiple people. Similarly with things like cholera, salmonella, etc. 

But I could be wrong and immune function could have a big role there. Anyway, the potency of the fecal-oral route is I&#039;m pretty sure the main reason for hand washing. Best practice in normal life is probably wash your hands after using the bathroom, but not that often otherwise, which is I suspect what most people do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[when all you have is a hammer...

The hand-washing studies came out of what doctors should do.  They are significantly more exposed than anybody else since they see sick people all day.  Back in the real world, SR should mark this as &quot;medical error.&quot;

I am wonder in psychology practices, what percent of complaints are sub-clincal? 85?  95?  99%]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I honestly wouldn&#039;t be able to answer those questions very well without actually recording my colds for a year. I can say that I seem to get fewer/shorter colds in the last few years than I used to (I spent winters during my teens with a chronic respiratory infection) - maybe I&#039;m doing better due to having children? I don&#039;t know, but sometimes I&#039;m surprised to find myself without cold symptoms.]]></description>
