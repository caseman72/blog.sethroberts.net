		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...to see whether closing a hole in the heart of patients with migraine would cure their migraine. It didn’t.&quot;

That ironic.  As it happens, I have such a hole in my heart: a &quot;patent foramen ovale&quot;.  When it was discovered, I spoke to a colleague of mine, who had the surgery to close it up.  To his suprise, his life-long string of migraines ended, and he&#039;s not had one since.

Turns out there&#039;s two types of patent foramen ovale: the one I have, which operates normally (no blood flow between chambers) and the one he had, which allows blood flow between the chambers, and hence creates micro-clots which can cause micro-strokes, which are thought to be one of the causes of migraines.

I wonder if the failure of this experiment was simply checking the wrong variable?

As to the topic of your quote, I wish it were surprising, but after a few years of research diet and the medical profession, I&#039;ve a: realized that my high esteem for doctors was a matter of faith, not reason, and b: I&#039;ve lost that faith.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think a relevant question to consider is &quot;how common is dishonesty in every field/endeavor?&quot;  

I think that you provide good evidence about dishonesty in medicine, but do you think it is more common than in other places?  Or perhaps you just think it&#039;s more damaging to lie when it affects physical health directly.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think you can do a lot more damage inside the body (drugs, surgery, medical devices) than outside the body (most goods and services). So dishonesty -- e.g., hiding bad side effects -- is much more damaging.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

Seth: I was surprised that people were promoted to dean and similar posts after being found guilty of research misconduct. I was also surprised that Smith did not give a reference to the Wilmshurst paper in the BMJ mentioned at the end.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
