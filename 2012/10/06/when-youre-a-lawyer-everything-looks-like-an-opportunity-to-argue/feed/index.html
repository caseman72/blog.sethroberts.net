		<description><![CDATA[Ah, no, I&#039;ve been here before. 

I think the world of anecdotes. In my professional world they&#039;re called cases. 

Indeed, consider the power of the anecdote, assuming for a moment its veracity (no small assumption, I understand). I single true event can negate contrary statistical suggestions of a virtually infinite data set, thereby pleasing Mr. Popper (of Vienna &amp; London, not of the Penguins). I think that this is why the law is so very cautious about statistics, since we are most often concerned with the single incident. 

But when making public policy, anecdotes are poison. Case in point: the McDonald&#039;s coffee case (see the documentary &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; if you don&#039;t appreciate my reference), or other tales of lawyers gone wild. Here statistics should guide us in separating anomalies from trends. 

So, I&#039;m sweet on both anecdotes &amp; statistical generalizations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 

Don&#039;t fall for the anecdotal evidence trap. 

Yes, these motions get filed, although I&#039;m surprised that a plaintiff&#039;s attorney filed it. As a practitioner, including medical malpractice claims, the waste-of-time stuff usually comes from the defense attorneys representing insurance carriers. Paid by the hour, and with virtually unlimited resources, insurance carriers (never the named the defendant but the ones who call the shots) do this sort of thing. Plaintiffs&#039; attorneys, at least this one, realized that the more time that they put in a on a case, the less the rate of return--if there is a return--since we work on a contingent fee basis. I wanted to get my case tried on the merits as quickly &amp; efficiently as possible. You should know that most medical malpractice cases are unsuccessful, regardless of merit. Juries don&#039;t like to enter verdicts against the good doctor. 

Please also note the venue of the anecdote: California. Having practiced in Iowa and Illinois, I can tell you that legal cultures, including the amount of posturing and BS, vary greatly from place to place. Chicago was a very different practice than Champaign. In Chicago-area courts &amp; legal practices, you find a great deal more posturing &amp; tactical use of delays &amp; uncertainties. (And I will not even contemplate corruption of judges, who are elected in Illinois, a hideous thing.) Iowa is more sedate. In a smaller jurisdiction, you can&#039;t afford to develop a reputation as a time-waster (think iterated prisoner&#039;s dilemma) . Judges are busy enough. Also, judges are appointed and don&#039;t have to solicit campaign funds, although we do have retention elections, which, until recently, were non-partisan. 

So are we perfect? No. Do some attorneys waste time &amp; BS? Yes. But on the whole, the courts and the legal culture, at least in Iowa, tend to minimize this nonsense. And I hate it, too!]]></description>
