		<description><![CDATA[My research for years has focussed on the dairy hormonal impact on acne.
These stories make me more and more interested in learning about the possibility of an antigenic cross-reactivity between the proteins in milk (from mammary glands) and the proteins in sebaceous glands. Could an allergy to one cross-react with the other? There is NO science on this to date.
BOTH glands are epidermal appendages and so should share antigens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many people do better on raw than pasteurised milk.  For a whole bunch of information about raw milk, you can check out;
http://www.realmilk.com/

It is known that some of the milk proteins are denatured by pasteurization.  For some people, their digestive system rects to these and their body mounts an immune response to it.  Acne is often the result of gut irritation and/or mild autoimmune conditions.

Powdered milk is even worse, and any productt that has &quot;modified milk ingredients&quot; has powdered milk, or worse.

Skim milk is one example - it is &quot;fortified&quot; with powedered milk to make it taste less watery.  For many people, they have trouble with skim milk and non fat yogurt - which we are all told to eat - but do fine with full fat milk and yogurt - the fats are somehow protective.

Clearly, Tony is more sensitive to this, and acne was the way it was manifested.  

There are many raw aged cheeses available - under USDA rules, a cheese can be made from raw milk if it is aged for more than 60 days.  Not all aged cheeses are raw, so check the labels.

A final thought, most cows in the US are Holstein-Friesan, which produce milk with type A1 casein protein.  Other cows, like Jersey, Guernsey, Dexter, all Indian breeds, buffalo, sheep, goats, horses and humans produce milk with type A2 casein.  Many people are sensitive to A1 casein but not A2 - the people who can only drink goats milk.  This is often mistaken for &quot;lactose intolerance&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[When you have multiple allergies, it is very difficult to figure out which foods are the culprits.  I had terrific results identifying my food allergies with the Meridian Valley E95 Basic and A95 Food Panels.  

I had severe Rheumatoid Arthritis that did not respond to any of the dozens of treatments that my board certified rheumatologist tried over a period of several years.  

A holistic doctor suggested we try the Meridian Valley Food Panels, so we drew blood and sent it off.  The results were very accurate when I checked them through elimination diet, and most of my symptoms went away when I eliminated dairy, eggs, wheat, and beef from my diet. 

Unless you can find a doctor already using the Meridian Valley tests, you will have to order a test kit and prepay for the test.  And of course you must have a doctor willing to draw the blood and ship it.  Meridian Valley is in Renton, WA.  Their phone number is 425-271-8689.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: very interesting, thanks.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll get a pimple if I eat anything with casein, soy, or wheat in it.  I have heard that there is a cross-reactivity with milk and wheat, but I don&#039;t know if a similar protein is in soy or not.  I won&#039;t even eat stuff with soy lecithin, but what&#039;s really annoying is when I try some supplement only to find it is made with soy.  In some cases, I think the supplement making process may purify whatever they are taking out of the soy to the point where it isn&#039;t a problem any more, but it is still a bit of a gamble.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe you are already aware but there are some studies linking milk consumption to acne:
http://nutritionfacts.org/video/skim-milk-and-acne/

You may also be interested in the nutritionfacts.org website which provides nice short videos regarding the latest research on nutrition. Although (I believe) it cherry picks studies to promote veganism, it is very informative. For example, I am sure you will be interested in how the bacteria in the mouth affects athletic performance:
