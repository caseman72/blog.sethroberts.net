		<description><![CDATA[QS offers many benefits, but one of the best benefits is avoiding mistreatment by medical professionals. Before QS, I was mostly a black box to myself and, consequently, medical and psychiatric professionals were often led to inappropriate treatments. 

If you track most things and can summarize it neatly, you&#039;ll no longer be subject to the inexplicable changes in sleep patterns, mood, energy, or weight that are the lynchpins of modern psychiatry. For example, this week the sun rises around 7:40 AM and the days are overcast. My mood and energy are noticeably lower. My sleep is disturbed because I started drinking coffee. Before QS, I was not sufficiently self-aware to reliably document these changes when talking to a doctor. So they&#039;re going to look for a medical explanation instead of a simple one.]]></description>
