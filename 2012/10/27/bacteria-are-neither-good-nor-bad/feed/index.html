		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a fascinating article about a microorganism that can rapidly move in when its competitors die off: &quot;Genetic Switch Underlies C. albicans Quick Change Act&quot;

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139635/ 

&quot;In most people, C. albicans is just another member of the body&#039;s flora, harmlessly coexisting with other microorganisms in their host. Bacteria in particular are important competitors that keep its spread in check. However, if the environment suddenly changes, causing bacteria to die off, C. albicans quickly adapts and takes over. Usually the effects are minor. Elderly people who use dentures may experience a dry or burning mouth condition known as “thrush.” Women who suffer from irritating yeast infections and most babies fussing over diaper rash are the victims of an overaggressive population of C. albicans. However, if the patient&#039;s white blood cells have been compromised, say because of chemotherapy or an aggressive steroid treatment, the effects can be devastating. Serious complications arise if the fungus enters the bloodstream, perhaps through a catheter, which C. albicans can only do while in the more benign yeast form. However, once in the bloodstream, the fungus can deposit throughout the body as invasive hyphae. At that point it becomes known as “hematogenously disseminated candidiasis,” which proves fatal in 40% of cases, even with the best modern treatments.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You may be interested to read René Dubos (one of the discoverers of antibiotics) , who wrote similar things in the 1950&#039;s. From the May 1955 issue of Scientific American:

&quot;A new look at the biological formulation of the germ theory seems warranted. We need to account for the peculiar fact that pathogenic agents sometimes can persist in the tissues without causing disease and at other times can cause disease even in the presence of specific antibodies. During the first phase of the germ theory the property of virulence was regarded as lying solely within the microbes themselves. Now virulence is coming to be thought of as ecological. Whether man lives in equilibrium with microbes or becomes their victim depends upon the circumstances under which he encounters them. This ecological concept is not merely an intellectual game; it is essential to a proper formulation of the problem of microbial diseases and even to their control.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PS - It&#039;s also a good example of why chronic infections are often very difficult to heal. Often steps toward healing lead to an initial aggravation of symptoms (usually ascribed to &quot;die-off&quot; releasing toxic cell wall components), causing people to reverse course, as she backed away from VLC/ketogenic diets several times.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: The die-off explanation is certainly different than what I am suggesting here (that a change in diet that eliminates a vital nutrient -- vital to one or more bacteria -- may thereby &quot;unleash&quot; other bacteria). I have never seen any evidence that the die-off explanation is correct but I will look around for such evidence.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Great anecdote and very plausible theory. But I&#039;m not sure the anecdote fits the theory, since the ketogenic diet on which she recovered is presumably more restrictive (less varied, even lower in carbs) than the diet on which she got sick. 

To me that suggests that what we need is a story of diet-microbe equilibria, in which there are multiple microbiomes that can be in equilibrium with any diet, and you can get stuck in a bad equilibrium. Dietary changes can depopulate an overgrown species, leading to a new equilibrium which may be more healthful. Then probiotics/fermented foods may enable a shift back to the original diet but with a different microbial equilibrium.

So this view is not &quot;good bacteria / bad bacteria&quot; but &quot;good microbiome / bad microbiome&quot; as in your theory; but it is not a story simply of &quot;diversity good / nondiversity bad&quot; even though it is a story of overgrowth of a nondiverse flora causing problems. The ketogenic diet may be have created a nondiverse flora that is not abundant, so the symptoms disappeared.

Best, Paul]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well I can think of a few bacteria that are unequivocally &quot;bad&quot;.  Bubonic plague.  Typhus.  I wouldn&#039;t blame the Black Death depopulation of Europe on faulty immune systems.  

Or maybe you were only referring to gut bacteria, not to nasties directly injected into the bloodstream by insects or contaminated medical equipment.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You mean &quot;on faulty immune systems and too little microbial diversity&quot;? Dosage also matters: Exposure to a large amount of Bacteria X may cause illness, exposure to a tiny amount may be safe. I am less convinced than you that exposure to tiny amounts of the bubonic plague bacteria would be dangerous if one had a well-working immune system and plenty of internal microbial diversity. At the time of the Black Death, people may have eaten narrow diets, low in some vital nutrients. Living conditions may have also caused first exposures to the bubonic plague bacteria to be large (dangerous) rather than small (safe). On the other hand, I think you&#039;re right. We can be exposed to a large amounts of certain bacteria without harm (e.g., the bacteria in yogurt) yet exposure to a large amount of certain other bacteria is dangerous. In that sense some bacteria are more dangerous than other bacteria.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: Thanks for the links. I didn’t know knee surgery led to antibiotics. Can you refuse the antibiotics?

Probably not, and they are probably a good idea even though they will do a number on my internal flora.  The concern with joint replacements is deep infections under or around the implants that can&#039;t be effectively treated because of poor blood supply deep in the joint.  So the docs want to avoid them at all costs.

What&#039;s more annoying is that after you have a joint replacement, you have to take antibiotics before dental work - for life, apparently.  Supposedly nasty bacteria from your mouth can get into the bloodstream during the dental activities.  They can supposedly get deposited around the implant and cause one of those hard-to-treat deep infections.  

I&#039;ve had a hip replacement for 20 years.  Four years ago when I moved, I didn&#039;t find a new dentist and didn&#039;t have my teeth cleaned or examined for all that time.  I had fixed my acid reflux by adopting a low carb diet, and I didn&#039;t want to undo that work by use of antibiotics. 

Finally I had to go to the dentist because I am required to get a dental clearance for the knee surgery.  I had an exam and cleaning.  Even though I have a lot of gum and bone recession extending back over more than 30 years, after  those four years my teeth were fine and my gums were in better shape than four years earlier.

What had changed?  1- low-carb diet. 2- stopped using toothpaste having a lot of glycerin (most of them ... for a while I brushed my teeth with Ivory soap). 3- I stopped flossing and started to clean between my teeth with a little &quot;proxy&quot; brush instead - I had found that flossing would start infections in my gums, and that doesn&#039;t happen when I use the proxy brush instead.

So - no dentist, no flossing, no standard toothpaste but plenty of attention to cleaning my teeth safely, reduce carbs which cause lots of crud to build up on the teeth.  Better results.  Hurray!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There may be more to this story as my experience suggests. All bacteria are consumers of nutrients ie compete with human cells. Our bodies (the inside) are not perfectly sterile and so bacteria mass accumulates with age as the immune system has a capacity limit. Our cells receive incrementally ever smaller amounts of energy (nutrients) as they age ie become smaller with succeeding replications. I have been able to significantly reverse periodontal disease via measures to limit gut bacteria after decades of gradual decay.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Jim,
I wouldn&#039;t be so fast to recommend beans, many types (especially soy, kidney and fava) have various components that are irritable/detrimental to many people.

We should also draw a distinction between soluble and insoluble fibre.  It is the soluble fibre we really want - which gut bacteria ferment into short chain fatty acids, among other things- and this can come from many sources other than beans.

The focus on &quot;healthy whole grains&quot; has led to many people getting too much insoluble fibre, which causes problems of its own, in addition to gluten and other grain proteins.

But your general point of more (soluble) fibre is in the mark, as are your points 2 &amp; 3 (4).  It is amazing how much we are prescribed things that do not cure our ills, but prolong them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As we learn more, we find that things are much more complicated than we thought, and much too complicated for the simplistic drug-everybody approach of doctors and their BigPharma friends.

These things we do know, at least based on recent research:
1. Fiber is good food for gut bacteria, so eat lots of fiber from things like beans, which also have lots of protein.
2. Antibiotics disrupt the gut bacteria, so try to avoid antibiotics. 
3. Antacids and proton pump inhibitors disrupt the gut bacteria, so try to avoid antacids.

And here&#039;s the most important lesson: Doctors love antibiotics and antacids, so try to avoid doctors.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Yeah. Antibiotics are said to be the most important medical advance of the last 100 years. Yet it is plausible they do more harm than good. What does that say about all the other &quot;advances&quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

Seth: Yeah. Antibiotics are said to be the most important medical advance of the last 100 years. Yet it is plausible they do more harm than good. What does that say about all the other &#8220;advances&#8221;?</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t remember now where I read an article/paper written by a leading gut flora doctor/researcher, but his recommendation was to eat a boring diet - the same few plants &amp; animals on a regular basis. His theory is that a very diverse diet breeds too many &quot;jack of all trades&quot; bacteria - none of which are really good at their job. Where a simple/boring diet, breeds experts that are really good at their job. 

 Of course a diet of junk/processed food will most likely breed a population of junk food junkie flora who are very good at their job - maybe, too good.

Bacteriotherapy Resolves Relapsing Clostridium difficile Disease in Mice
http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1002995

Tending the Body’s Microbial Garden

I&#039;m especially interested in this since I&#039;m about to have major knee surgery and the docs will insist on hitting me with big jolts of antibiotics.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the links. I didn&#039;t know knee surgery led to antibiotics. Can you refuse the antibiotics?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
