		<description><![CDATA[Despite a Weston Price + fermented food products I still had AM congestion (Spring trees, dust mites) although better but became incidentally dramatically improved after markedly reducing wheat. Am not 100% grain free by any means but must be some total load issue because doesn&#039;t worsen after eating a wheat product. And I&#039;ve certainly done the gamut of various allergy reduction supplements and treatments etc. My Kleenex utilization index has dropped dramatically!

Question: is there any rationale for a sinus mucus &quot;transplant&quot;? That&#039;s something I have yet to read anything about, a la fecal transplantation]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting, my spouse has developed a sporadic runny nose for the first time in his life, he was hospitalized a year ago and had some antibiotics at that time but none since. (His immune system has actually been very good for the last year, no or only very mild colds/flu)  We were blaming it on the fact he has had to take lots of new medications, but they are for the heart, and we saw no connection whatsoever with his nose.  He does eat yogurt, but not on a daily basis.  Oh, and we both take Vitamin D, but I&#039;m the one who has had several colds!
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: great observation! I mean about your spouse.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, your fermented probiotics may well have helped promote a healthier bacterial balance in your nasal microbiome, but could there also have been other factors?

For example, had you been taking antibiotics earlier, and could the antibiotics have been killing off the &quot;good&quot; bacteria like lactobacilli and bifidobacteria?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I had taken antibiotics 20 years earlier. I doubt their effect lasts so long. The first useful thing I learned from my self-experimentation was that antibiotics were not helping my acne, so I stopped taking them.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
