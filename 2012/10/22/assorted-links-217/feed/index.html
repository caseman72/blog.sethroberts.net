		<description><![CDATA[Peter at hyperlipid talks about the Look Ahead study&#039;s being halted early because of a supposed lack of difference between the studies arms, pointing out that it&#039;s possible that the true reason the study was halted was that It was well on its way of proving that the standard of care kills people (all cause mortality In the intervention arm was higher than the other arm (and rising) when they cut off the study.)

In other words, it&#039;s very likely that halting the study is a massive cover-up that  will permit the standard of care from being corrected, resulting in the continued pointless deaths of thousands of people.
