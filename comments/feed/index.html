		<description><![CDATA[I am stunned to read of Seth&#039;s passing, just found out about it this morning when someone left a comment on my book review of the Shangri La Diet. My sincere condolences to all of Seth&#039;s family and friends.

 He was a unique individual and a very caring, giving person, from what I knew. We corresponded by email for a few months when I read, used and wrote about the Shangri La diet, several years ago. This makes me so sad...may he RIP.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth!
I just learned tonight why you failed to show up on the 26th of April as we had planned.  I didn&#039;t want to bug you so I didn&#039;t call or email to ask what happened.  Now I know.  I finally sent an email tonight asking if you were alright--&#039;cause it wasn&#039;t like you to disappear.  I am in shock to know that my worse fears are true.

Seth came to see me after the publication of The Chair in 1998.  No other colleague sought me out on the basis of ideas.  Turns out we were both Reedies, and I proposed that we teach a course together, &quot;The office of the future&quot; (which we thought of as neolithic).  We did, twice, once with others from the business school, &quot;The Post-Dilbert Office.&quot; We were both interested in nutrition and food and ate together in NYC and the Bay area intermittently.  We had dinner at the new restaurant that replaced O Chame on April 24.  He offered to help me with some computer issues on the afternoon of the 26th.  

Seth, my friend, this is your friend Galen, saying farewell--and re-opening to the depth of appreciation I have for you.  You&#039;d love the book I&#039;m reading now.  Dang, I wish we could talk about it after you read it.
Love,
Galen]]></description>
