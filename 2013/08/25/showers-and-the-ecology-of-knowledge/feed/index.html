		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, how are you? I have a question related to your previous post on pork belly but I am not sure where to ask. I am interested in the benefits of the animal fat and hence I would like to try your recipe with pork belly and miso soup. Yet, I could not find it while searching over your blog. Thanks.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I just cooked the pork belly and added it to miso soup. That&#039;s all.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You call for complexity in nutrition. Art DeVaney and Nassim Taleb call for chaos in nutrition. I think it is the same thing. 

Who knows what combination of nutrients the body needs?  When I go to a salad bar, I try to put in my bowl 11-13 different vegetables. I like the idea of complexity, you should write more about it.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: In nutrition, complexity is a matter of enzymes: more enzymes, more complexity. It&#039;s like having more books in a library. I&#039;m not sure what chaos is in this situation. I wouldn&#039;t say that a larger library is more chaotic than a smaller one.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
