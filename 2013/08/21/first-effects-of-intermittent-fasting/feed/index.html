		<description><![CDATA[Have not tried reading the scans, but you could... example images at http://www.fitnessassist.com/blog/bodymetrix-ultrasound-body-composition/. I&#039;ve been using waist measurement as a proxy for visceral fat.

This fellow -- http://bjorngranum.com/intermittent-fasting-end-of-20-day-challenge-with-measurements-and-summary
 (a trainer) gets more consistent results than I….  see the video @3:57; very little variation.

 I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a practice effect with either calipers or the bodymetrix. Not so simple as stepping on a scale.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow!

I&#039;m fascinated by the BodyMetrix device. It looks like it can also do 2D imaging. Have you played around with that? I also wonder if it can do any sort of cardiovascular imaging (e.g. heart or carotid arteries). I&#039;m guessing they are not FDA approved for that and therefore can&#039;t talk about it.

BodyMetrix says the device can distinguish between superficial and deep visceral fat. Have you looked into that? It would be very nice to see whether different diets favor loss of one vs. the other.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;ve never used BodyMetrix device. This data does not make me want to, either&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, what happened to the very interesting links you had posted this AM (re kvas, teetotaling, etc.)?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I posted them too early. They will re-appear tomorrow.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
