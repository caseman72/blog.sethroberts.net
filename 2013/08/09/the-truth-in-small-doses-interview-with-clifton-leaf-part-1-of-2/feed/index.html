		<description><![CDATA[Somewhere on the web I saw words to the effect of &quot;Cancer is a thousand diseases with a common symptom.&quot;  I wish people would repeat that rather than the ludicrous &quot;The War on Cancer&quot;.

&quot;Jobs demand steady results. There can be no taking chances, no long periods of failure.&quot;  Yes, but why?  Who imported this daft mindset into science?  After all it&#039;s not the mindset that dominates, for example, oil exploration, where periods of failure are accepted as part of the the cost of big successes.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: People who aren&#039;t scientists asked for it and scientists agreed. Inherent in the notion of job is trade with people with other jobs. People with other jobs (e.g., legislators, parents, journalists, etc.) give scientists money, attention, and so on and want something in return. Such as visible progress. Scientists themselves don&#039;t point out how deeply science is screwed up by emphasis on short-term progress (Stockholm Syndrome?), so it is unsurprising that outsiders don&#039;t see it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nicolas Taleb has something to say about the medical system as well in his most recent book &quot;Antifragility&quot;. In short, he thinks that the current system does not do enough experimentation and tries to much to design a solution. This makes it open to downside (failure) but closes it to upside (unexpected discoveries).

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: My view is the current system makes science into a job. Jobs demand steady results. There can be no taking chances, no long periods of failure. But good science -- in contrast to assembly line science -- demands exactly that. That is a blend of what Taleb and Leaf say. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, thanks!  This is wonderful.  And you&#039;ve just sold one copy of this book.  That said, and I&#039;m not criticizing your reading, but I totally agree with this blurb regarding Sporn.  Of course, this is out of the greater context of the book, as well, so maybe I&#039;ll be similarly concerned when I read it (I take the view that most of the preventive epidemiology stuff is pretty much bunk).]]></description>
