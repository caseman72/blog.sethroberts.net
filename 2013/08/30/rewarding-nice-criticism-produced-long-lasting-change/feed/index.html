I like that example. Presumably this would be less effective if the person being trained had no affection for the trainer. But even more I wonder how well it would have worked if the trainer (wife) did not love the trainee (husband).

Seth,

I came across your blog about a month ago and somehow ended up reading through most of it. I believe I learned quite a bit. To me, most interesting topics I&#039;ve read about here are: the Shangri-La &quot;Diet&quot; (ahead of its time), development of skill in context of human evolution, Jane Jacobs as a thinker on all sorts of things, self-experimentation as part of a new literacy, most of your thoughts on statistics (e.g., against uncritical &quot;Correlation is not causation&quot;). There&#039;s more, I&#039;m sure. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/fashion/25love.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What Shamu Taught Me About a Happy Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&quot;

The author uses animal-training techniques to address her husband&#039;s annoying behaviors.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The central lesson I learned from exotic animal trainers is that I should reward behavior I like and ignore behavior I don&#039;t. After all, you don&#039;t get a sea lion to balance a ball on the end of its nose by nagging. The same goes for the American husband.

Back in Maine, I began thanking Scott if he threw one dirty shirt into the hamper. If he threw in two, I&#039;d kiss him. Meanwhile, I would step over any soiled clothes on the floor without one sharp word, though I did sometimes kick them under the bed. But as he basked in my appreciation, the piles became smaller.

I was using what trainers call &quot;approximations,&quot; rewarding the small steps toward learning a whole new behavior. You can&#039;t expect a baboon to learn to flip on command in one session, just as you can&#039;t expect an American husband to begin regularly picking up his dirty socks by praising him once for picking up a single sock. With the baboon you first reward a hop, then a bigger hop, then an even bigger hop. With Scott the husband, I began to praise every small act every time: if he drove just a mile an hour slower, tossed one pair of shorts into the hamper, or was on time for anything.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
