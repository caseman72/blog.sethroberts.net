Her blog posts about beeminder are also very good. Talk about closing the goals-data-behavior loop!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I believe you misread figure F1 with respect to insulin levels.

Figure 1B shows insulin levels as a function of time for the different meals,
and the whey protein level is higher than all the others for most of the post-prandial period. 

Figure 1C shows the insulin index of the meals (in light bars.) Again, the whey protein meal shows the highest level.

Finally, quoting from the paper itself:

The insulin iAUC following human milk, bovine milk and casein was similar to that seen with WWB. In contrast, the whey meal exhibited higher insulin iAUC 0–120 min, than the WWB (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the whey meal resulted in an elevated insulin response (iAUC 0–120 min) also when compared with data for casein and human milk.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the correction. Yes, I said lowered insulin when I meant lowered blood sugar.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see how using whey protein to raise your insulin level is beneficial long term. I believe, reducing your carbohydrate load would be much more beneficial; short term and long term.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The whey protein lowered insulin level, see http://www.nutritionj.com/content/11/1/83/figure/F1.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: What is the dishonesty?

The use of &quot;significantly&quot; - which the layman will interpret as &#039;substantially&#039; - when the original result is &quot;statistically significant&quot;, a quite different concept.  (To be fair, I don&#039;t know whether this article is guilty of that crime, but if it isn&#039;t it&#039;s damn near unique.)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The reduction is large, see http://www.nutritionj.com/content/11/1/83/figure/F1. Certainly &quot;significant&quot; in the sense of important. The authors are guilty of not making that clear.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whey protein in cheese?
From my understanding, most of the whey is removed from cheese. Except for a few cheeses (like Ricotta), shouldn&#039;t cheese be especially low in whey protein?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,  
What are you thoughts on fermented meats?  If we eat fermented vegetables and dairy, shouldn&#039;t we be letting our meats ferment?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I try to eat fermented meats. For example, prosciutto, aged salami. Cremenelli salami is especially good.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
