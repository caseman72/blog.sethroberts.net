		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating. Interfering with any dynamic system will cause a back reaction and has the potential for instability. Something neglected by interfering politicians who think things they don&#039;t like can be &#039;fixed&#039; ... 
I liked your comments on &#039;optimality and complexity&#039;. It allows us to focus on an argument more effectively. 
On a tangent -  I am curious as to how humans - with our biological dependence on complex systems of micro-organisms - will cope in space. Will the exported microbes develop new strategies for living in space? And will returning astronauts struggle to cope with the terrestrial environment?]]></description>
