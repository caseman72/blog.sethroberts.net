		<description><![CDATA[And by insisting on full retribution and perpetually tarring the culprit, one raises the stakes and guarantees the culprit will fight the accusations tooth-and-nail and never clearly admit guilt or lay out what was falsified.

It may be satisfying to destroy their ability to &#039;rebuild their lives in the future&#039;, but there are consequences to total warfare and some of those may be unintended. There are reasons lawyer &amp; doctor confidentiality extend to crimes; another good example is how felony murder laws encourage additional murders - if you&#039;re already going to jail for life for committing an armed robbery, you might as well kill the clerk so he can&#039;t testify later. The Bloody Code was repealed for good reason.

So the question is: do you want vengeance, or do you want to make the world a better place?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Research fraud&lt;/b&gt;&#160; A researcher at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands has been fired for committing scientific fraud, the centre announced on 14 August. Annemie Schuerwegh, who worked in the rheumatology department, admitted manipulating data included in a study published in &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt; in 2010, says a report from the centre. She went into the laboratory outside office hours and added mouse antibodies to tubes of human blood samples. The centre will withdraw the article and another paper, and has halted a clinical trial based in part on the fraudulent data.
