		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Engineering, art, architecture, foreign language and perhaps statistics classes are exceptions.&quot;

Seth, it would be interesting to hear why you called out those particular disciplines as exceptions (to &quot;most classes&quot;).

Also,
&quot;In a social psychology class, for example, they learn about social psychology research. The class is not about how to do social psychology. It is about what has been done and what has been learned. If the class consisted entirely of students who wanted to become psychology professors, that would be fine.&quot;

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, it&#039;s not black and white. In most classes, you learn knowledge. In a small number of classes, you learn skills. In many engineering classes you build something. In most foreign language classes, you learn to speak and read the language. In (studio) art classes you make art. And so on. It&#039;s not black and white because in chemistry and physics classes there are often labs, in geology classes you may go on field trips and learn to identify rocks, an animal learning class may have a lab, and so on.&lt;/strong&gt;

This seems contradictory. If a class consisted &quot;entirely of students who wanted to become psychology professors,&quot; then wouldn&#039;t we want it to actually be about &quot;how to do social psychology&quot; rather than merely about &quot;what has been done&quot; already? After all, students who want to be psychology professors need to learn how to do psychology.

My sense is that students in a typical undergraduate class (and K-12) aren&#039;t learning how to &quot;do&quot; the disciplines, but rather how to do some related busywork. I certainly didn&#039;t get to &quot;do&quot; much real mathematics before graduate-level courses. Maybe this is not that different from what you&#039;re saying.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree with you. I wouldn&#039;t call the usual curriculum &quot;busywork&quot; but I agree that it is quite different than &quot;real math&quot;, &quot;how to do social psychology&quot; and so on. There is a  busywork element of most classes in the sense that the content is relatively convenient for the professor to teach. Easier to lecture about what social psychologists have learned than to teach a social psychology lab, for example.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

And yet you ain&#039;t learning Chemistry if you are not doing a lab class where you - not you and a partner - do organic syntheses, quantitative analysis, and so forth.  Doing is an essential part of learning in many disciplines.  Even the mild mathematician must &quot;do&quot; problem after problem until he has internalised theory and practice sufficiently to solve problems skilfully.]]></description>
