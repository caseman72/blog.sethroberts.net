		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure that &quot;high carb low fat&quot; is accurate either.

If the diet is improving brain function in people with impaired brain glucoes metabolism, it is almost certainly because of ketones - the brain cannot process fatty acids/triglycerides.

But this does not neccessarily require it to be low carb, either.  Eat coconut oil and/or medium chain triglycerides, and your body produces ketones even when you are still eating plenty of carbs.

There is the well known case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/spring-hill-couple-inspires-research-into-coconut-oil-for-alzheimers/2124596&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr Mary Newport&lt;/a&gt;, who treated her husband&#039;s alzheimers by adding coconut oil to his oatmeal, and saw improvements in days.  

This would not have been an LCHF diet, nor even &quot;ketogenic&quot; by the normal definition, but it does produce ketones and did improve his brain function.

I&#039;ll guess, and it&#039;s just a guess, that the epileptics have to avoid certain types of proteins that have high glutamate content - as glutamate excites neurons, while ketones produce GABA to inhibit them.   

Its easy to see there&#039;s lots more to be learnt in this area, and also easy to see that since ketones/MCT&#039;s/coconut oil are not drugs nor patentable, there isn;t much money being devoted to research on them.

Given Seth&#039;s results with butter, I&#039;m sure butyric acid helps the brain too, though likely in a different way, since it produces improvements that coconut oil doesn&#039;t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Ketogenic&quot; implies more than just high fat, doesn&#039;t it?  The carb intake must also be low enough for the body to go into ketosis.

Also, it seems to me that &quot;ketogenic&quot; diets for epilepsy are often more restrictive than ketogenic diets for weight loss or endurance sports, because some epileptics have to severely restrict their protein intake as well to avoid seizures.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Then &quot;high-fat low-carb diet&quot; would have been a good name. The trouble with &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; is that it implies that the diet works because it produces ketosis. That coulde easily be wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, all commercial produced cream cheese in the US contains one or more of the dreaded &quot;gums&quot; - guar, xanthan or carob bean - none of which I can tolerate. Fortunately, the European versions, do not - creme fraiche, mascarpone, etc., also quark and farmer cheese.
