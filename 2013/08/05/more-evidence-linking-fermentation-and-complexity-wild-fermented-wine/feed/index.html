		<description><![CDATA[Seth, apparently there isn&#039;t really any such thing as a true &quot;wild yeast&quot; fermentation.  Rather, when they&#039;ve actually looked into it, regardless of what yeast starts off, they&#039;re all out-competed in fairly short order by dominant commercial wine-specific yeast strains.

		<description><![CDATA[I bake bread, mostly sourdough.  I use a long fermentation time - usually 12 - 16 hours.  It&#039;s well known in the baking business that longer fermentation times lead to more flavor.  Some of that is just time hydrated (wet) aside from any fermentation, but fermentation also plays a big role.

I did an experiment in which I used a pinch of conventional yeast to make one batch of dough, and my regular sourdough culture for another.  The recipes were adjusted to have the same overall amounts of flour and water, and the pinch of yeast was selected to give about the same fermentation time as the sourdough batch would take.

The result was that both batches fermented, handled, and baked essentially the same as each other.  The sourdough bread clearly had better and more complex flavor.

I&#039;d done the same kind of thing before, with similar results, but this time I made sure that the recipes and fermentation times were the same so as to get a more controlled comparison.

In developing a sourdough culture, it&#039;s often said that you get wild yeast from the air.  That may be so on occasion, but I have reasons (I won&#039;t go into here) for thinking that most of the yeast arrives with the flour you use to create the sourdough culture.  Eventually the culture stabilizes with a mixture of yeast and lactic and acetic acid bacteria.  It&#039;s the mix of all three that gives the fine sourdough quality - the complexity that Seth talks about.]]></description>
