		<description><![CDATA[What about drinking coffee on fast days? Encouraged or what that alter the effects of fasting? I would be concerned about low blood sugar making me cranky, but I think black coffee would help compensate.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I drink lots of tea on fast days. Including Choffy, a coffee substitute made with chocolate. I brew it like tea.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Thomas Johnson: I see. I think I got a little nausea as well when I tried zinc. You could try splitting the dose up. I found some info that suggests the amount your body absorbs is inversely proportional to the dose you take, so taking smaller doses more frequently would probably benefit you in 2 ways: less stomach upset &amp; a greater percentage absorbed in each dose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Ashish: Have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_acid#Secretion. Stomach acid is secreted in response to a meal. No meal = less acid, at least from my reading.

		<description><![CDATA[Does fasting give him bad breath? That seems to be a common side effect. Aren&#039;t bad smells, like the smell of feces, our body&#039;s way of telling us that something is wrong - or, in the case of feces, &quot;don&#039;t eat this&quot;? (As a practical matter, how does he deal with the fasting-induced halitosis?)

Also - I know, so many questions - what is our best understanding of the physiological process by which fasting creates benefits such as loss of bad fat, reduced GERD, etc.? My experience is that missing a meal increases acid reflux, so I hesitate to go all the way.

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Thomas Johnson: Most medications can be taken with or without food, the food slows absorption &amp; can minimize stomach upset. There are only a few that really need to be taken with food. Off the top of my head, I can only think of one &amp; it is an anti-parasite drug that you&#039;re probably not taking. What drugs do you take that you think must be taken with food?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also just came across this interesting snippet at http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/nutrition-vitamins-11/fat-water-nutrient?page=1

Water-soluble nutrients work best when you get them in the proper amounts. When you eat or take more than your body needs, the body adapts by absorbing just what it needs, and then it usually excretes the excess in your urine -- but not always. A study in the August 2010 Journal of Nutrition Science and Vitaminology found that urinary excretion of certain vitamins and other nutrients was reduced when study participants fasted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few questions for you or your friend about the practicality of ADF:

* If you take medications that are supposed to be taken &quot;with food&quot; (which typically means that they are fat-soluble I think) how do you deal with this?

* How do you deal with the social aspect of eating? When your friends invite you to go out for lunch/dinner/drinks with them, do you just order a water?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m not taking any medications. When eating with friends, I just eat very little.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
