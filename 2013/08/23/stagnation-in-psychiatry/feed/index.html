		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
Have you read Leah Greenfeld&#039;s Mind, Modernity, Madness? I haven&#039;t yet, but I&#039;ve read a bit of it plus her blogs, which provide the main thesis. It seems very similar to the lines along which you are thinking, although she comes at the issue as an anthropologist &amp; political scientist (and perforce, as a historian). A compelling &amp; fascinating topic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We also have a lot of stagnation in other areas of medicine. The advances are minimally incremental and, because of industrial interests, the effects are overstated. Take statins for example. The sad truth is that we had little revolution since vaccination and antibiotics.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree. Also the bad effects are understated. And antibiotics are questionable: the bad effects could easily outweigh the good effects.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the great increase in depression probably has multiple causes, one of which is quite ironic.  Antidepressant drugs probably cause depression (or, at least, exacerbate it).  See, for example:
