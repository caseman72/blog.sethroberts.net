		<description><![CDATA[Some of the best comedians are seriously disturbed individuals. (I feel certain this has been the subject of many a suitably boring Ph.D. thesis.) Nevertheless, studies have shown that women do seek a &quot;good sense of humor&quot; in mates, so there is both reproductive and survival value, I think, in one&#039;s ability to find humor in things. It&#039;s a tricky area, though. Finding inappropriate humor in things is not unknown in schizophrenia. Norman Cousins famously tried to tie sense-of-humor to reduced mortality. It would be interesting to know if any recent work has been done in this area. 

Sounds like a great area for future blogs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Actually, I don’t agree with the premise. One person comes to mind: Woody Allen.&quot;

Humour is a good sign of &lt;i&gt;intelligence&lt;/i&gt;, perhaps, but not of emotional stability. One could add Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, Peter Cook, Lenny Bruce, Richard Prior, Rodney Dangerfield, Tony Hancock and Kenneth Williams, and that&#039;s just a drop in an ocean of misery.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a question I&#039;ve wondered about since childhood.  How does one know that a joke has been made even if one has not seen the joke?  By &quot;one&quot; I mean an ordinary, well-adjusted person.  

Would the same question be valid for a psychopath?]]></description>
