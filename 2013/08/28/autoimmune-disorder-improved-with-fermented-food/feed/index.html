		<description><![CDATA[Wheat is one of the only plants we know of that is a known cause of auto-immune reactions.  (Poison Ivy being the other one, but no-one eats that.)  

Wheat-caused autoimmune diseases are known to affect every tissue in the body.  

I think it&#039;s a pretty safe bet therefore that removing wheat was the trigger for his improvement, and not the beet juice...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it was likely both.

Getting rid of the wheat and sugar certainly removes the major gut irritants and contributors to disordered gut flora, but the fermented stuff helps provide the right flora to restore balance.

Add to that that beet kvass has a long standing reputation as a blood cleanser, and I&#039;d say it was both.

There are some clinical studies looking at beetroot, and its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22414688&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blood pressure reducing effects&lt;/a&gt;.  The lactic and other acids from fermentation (and probably a good dose of B vitamins too) almost certainly help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ditto Alex...how do we know? I for one, cannot seem to tolerate fermented foods, no matter the type or how much I like them, and I do like them - they give me horrible heart burn.

So, I&#039;m sticking with feeding a limited, but robust, gut flora, instead of a weaker diverse, multicultural variety. 

Cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, but maybe it was the absence of coffee, wheat, and/or sugar.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, that&#039;s a fair question, I should have stressed that.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
