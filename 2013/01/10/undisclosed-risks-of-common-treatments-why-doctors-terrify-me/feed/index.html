		<description><![CDATA[Really interesting stuff.  I&#039;m on a SSRI (citalopram) after a lot of consideration and a lot of nothing else working well enough.  But some of my allergy and asthma drugs that my doctor believes I should take regularly are anticholinergics, and I&#039;ve always felt quite negatively about taking them every day.  The trade off of how I felt on them was rarely worth the benefit to my asthma.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I unfortunately have a fairly large inguinal hernia and surgery of course has been recommended.

The surgeon I found to do the procedure (in the next couple months) is a professor of General Surgery and has written various publications regarding the best methods/materials for preventing chronic pain and fixation issues with the surgery. At the surface, this appealed to me before I even spoke to him because he is a doctor who at least recognizes the issues with the surgery.

Upon consulting with him, he told me that the method he uses is laparoscopic (he has done primarily laparoscopic hernia repairs at a hernia repair center at university hospitals for nearly 10 years) and that he uses newer, large pore, lightweight meshes in the repair. He said that many of the chronic pain issues are tied to the older method of using a mesh plug and overlay with the open repair, which placed a lot of mesh material over nerves which lead to chronic pain. He then went on to describe that by using a single lighter weight mesh, implanted behind the muscular fascia via laparocopy, placing the staples used to hold the mesh away from the nearby nerves, that he has not encountered any patients long-term that have dealt with chronic pain issues.

His explanation seemed to be on-par with research I had read, and has left me feeling more confident about the procedure I will undergo. 

What are your thoughts on the matter based on what I have described?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Sounds reasonable to me. I had laparoscopic surgery for a hernia and did not have further problems.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not surprised that anticholinergic drugs are associated with impaired cognitive function. I&#039;ve just completed a study in which an acetylcholine antagonist was injected into rats either systemically or directly infused into the dorsal hippocampus. While this treatment did not affect a simple instrumental discrimination (positive patterning), it impaired performance on a more complex instrumental discrimination (negative patterning) known to be dependent on hippocampal function.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are 2 major risks with bariatric surgery that no-one I know who has had it was told about. 

As mentioned in one of last May&#039;s New Scientist - disrupting the neural net around the gut can cause fascinating changes in taste - fish tea for example - which may reverse. 

And more serious changes in the size of short term memory - downwards - which will not reverse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does anyone else think these number sound too crazy to be correct?  For instance:
&quot;patients who took sleeping pills died 4.6 times as often during follow-ups averaging 2.5 years [than matched patients who did not take sleeping pills].&quot;

4.6 times the mortality?  And tonsillectomies increase heart attack risk by 50%?  Does this even sound credible?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You are welcome to examine the studies from which these estimates come.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
