		<description><![CDATA[I go partner dancing a lot, and one thing I&#039;ve noticed about many Asian women is that they are often sexless. They may be dressed sexily; they may look extremely attractive -- but it&#039;s all a performance. They are like terrified children putting on a show, like six-year-old Wizards of Oz at the controls of a mannikin that looks thirty and alluring.

I think it&#039;s a pathology that is passed down through the generations: the young don&#039;t get to enjoy their youth, and they age into mothers that are enraged and determined to get back that which has been lost -- which is of course impossible. So they try harder and get angrier, demanding ever more from the doppelganger, pushing the pathology down another generation.

Something different but analogous happens with enraged, narcissistic Jewish-American mothers and their castrated, humiliated sons.  The women often think they are more fabulous than they are, and the men think they are worthless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With what else would one equip one&#039;s window but glass?  An old sheet of polythene held in place by drawing pins?  Waxed brown paper?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good question. Maybe the editor was so stunned by what she was reading -- the whole book is an enormous surprise -- that she forgot to edit.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a fruitful sentence to ponder.

If Sophia didn&#039;t earn at least some subtraction-of-suffering reward from praise well-earned, then it would be a chilling narration from the mother. As a child pianist, albeit under considerably less pressure, I can assure you that once you&#039;ve submitted to the work necessary to prepare (and especially if you&#039;ve shirked it a little), having a performance come off well (on however large a stage) is a potent reward, no matter the dislike of practice.

What puts me off is just the status-brag &quot;glass-windowed room overlooking the Mediterranean&quot; (so you know, the people in that room must be AMAZING).]]></description>
