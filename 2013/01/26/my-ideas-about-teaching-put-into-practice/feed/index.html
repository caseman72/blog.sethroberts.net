The most important facial dimensions and corresponding psychological dimensions have not been measured yet in a study. For the most part, psychologists do not even pay attention to the hardwired psychological dimensions I have uncovered. This is because they are mostly not independent axes on self-reporting.

Extro/introversion most closely corresponds to the recession of the eyeball from the upper brow bone, aka socket depth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are correct that the face reading studies are not very good yet. I happen to know that they will get much better, but you can&#039;t know that yet. I know why they are not very good - because they haven&#039;t found the right things to measure. Human facial inference is still better than academic methods.

Introversion / extroversion is by far the least polluted and most accurate of the big 5 self report dimensions. There are certainly accurate self-report dimensions - for example male partner count is accurate. 

The page you linked does not specify that the assessment was self-report. The paper has not yet been published. However, I agree with the  pro-ambivert result. But this result is not very interesting, by itself, because it does not cover the biological or biographical angles.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: May I ask how you know that face reading studies will get much better? I haven&#039;t heard that before.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’ve found some relevant evidence. Is it possible that it might be your turn to do so?&quot;

IIRC, you&#039;ve admitted that psychology is mostly useless. That&#039;s because the science is in its infancy. Here are the green shoots of real, hard psychology that I&#039;ve described above. It will correlate biomarkers with actual, not just self-reported, psychological traits.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the links. I don&#039;t know about the brain damage study. The correlation between facial features and behavior is very weak. Nothing here suggests to me that this work is better (or will ever be better) than the self-report psychology you disparage. Why do we listen to what other people say? Because there is usually some truth to it. Why do you think speech evolved? Because it was useful. Self-report personality psychology is just psychology based on what people say. Many many things in the world are based on what people say and work fine. Sure, roughly all  psychology research is useless. Same with all academic research. An engineering graduate student at Berkeley told me that 95% of the research in her department was useless.

Update: this article provides considerable evidence of the practical value of self-report psychology: http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/why-extroverts-fail-introverts-flounder-and-you-probably-succeed/2013/01/28/bc4949b0-695d-11e2-95b3-272d604a10a3_singlePage.html?tid=obnetwork#&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

&quot;Seth: Stomach acid kills only what is on the surface. We do not atomize our food in our mouths. It goes into our stomach in lumps. What’s inside the lumps is safe from the acid.&quot;

 However, by the time food is ready to leave the stomach it is far away from being &quot;lumps.&quot;  It is a chalky, watery mix called chyme, having been totally massaged and mixed with acidic, watery, &quot;mucus-y&quot; secretions.  Many/most (?) bacteria survive the acid of the stomach, but not because they are inside the lumps (boluses) of food that came down the esophagus.  These &quot;lumps&quot; are totally liquefied before they enter the small intestine, and have been thoroughly exposed to gastric acids.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting.  You might be interested in this report Teaching Boys and Girls How to Study&#039; (1919) by Peter Jeremiah Zimmers,  Superintendent of City Schools, Manitowoc, Wisconsin (scanned online, Google Books) about the very good results the school system had when they shifted away from the teacher-dominated lecture system to the problem method of teaching.  Sadly, such innovations never took widespread hold and we became stuck with the lecture style instruction that has long been known to induce &quot;school helplessness&quot; in students.  The first reference I&#039;ve found to the damage school does to creative and innovative thinking was a minor discussion in a book published in 1886.

&quot;In spite of the fact that schools exist for the sake of education, there is many a school whose pupils show a peculiar &quot;school helplessness&quot;; that is, they are capable of less initiative in connection with their school tasks than they commonly exhibit in the accomplishment of other tasks.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I presume you mean a study, which is a small subset of the word &quot;evidence&quot;. You linked to Wikipedia, which is untrustworthy on this topic, and a paper behind a paywall. Link to the best paper I can access and let&#039;s see whether Big 5 and MBTI are good for anything practical, or are just for academic promotion and horoscope-style self-discovery.

And keep in mind, this argument started because someone said something about how openness was more important than high IQ for self-directed coursework. The very idea of naively comparing Chinese vs American students&#039; self descriptions of openness is ridiculous, and even more so for Tsinghua students. Yet if you give those kids an inch they zoom off into independent genius mode. Hmmm....

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t say &quot;lack of correlation&quot;. I said &quot;semi-interesting correlations&quot;. 

I think you and I have very different ideas about how useful psychology should be. You&#039;re impressed by useless vague correlations of the Big 5. I&#039;m not. What&#039;s it good for? 

If I am blind screening applicants for a job, I will a million times take an IQ test over a Big 5 test. 

One of the concepts of PUA is &quot;value elicitation.&quot; And one of the ironies is that often the values are the opposite of what the person is really like. 

I have studied the life histories of over 50 applicants to my Neander Hall, in the process of typing them. I can never simply take what they say about themselves or their values at face value. It all must be placed into life context, and compared to what other people like them and different from them said and did. 

Real psychology will be founded on biological axes, such as testosterone and facial shape. It must account for things like social status, charisma, and actual extro/introversion. Naive interpretation of self-description will never accurately reveal these traits. Even the most benighted psychologist should realize that a guy&#039;s self-reported notch count can be quite misleading, and his subjective rating of the women&#039;s attractiveness even more so. 

Self description is nice for publishing papers but doesn&#039;t give us any better grasp on human nature. It is only one of three crucial elements - the other two being biology and biography.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m sorry you have not seen fit to provide evidence for your view that personality psychology -- at least, the part based on self-report - is worthless.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Are you saying that intellectual curiosity (= openness) as measured by self-report personality tests, doesn’t correlate with anything important?&quot;

Yes. And I am saying that all 5 Big 5 self-report dimensions are hopelessly flawed. Taking people&#039;s self-descriptions at face value is not an intelligent way to practice psychology, even if it does permit large scale data collection. It is like studying cars by color. There will be some semi-interesting correlations, but nothing actually reliable.

The problem is that there are radically different types of people who describe themselves in similar ways, or in ways opposite to or orthogonal to what they actually are compared to the general population. The &quot;publishable results&quot; system has led to an explosion in worthless statistically-significant results. As a result, psychology has moved further and further away from anything resembling an intelligent grasp of human nature. 

Psychologists can&#039;t afford to go under the hoods of cars one at a time. So instead they count car colors from a highway overpass. Useless.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; cites many studies that disagree with what you say about openness (lack of correlation). For example, http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.120.3.323. What evidence supports your view (&quot;hopelessly flawed&quot;)?&lt;/strong&gt;

The &#8220;publishable results&#8221; system has led to an explosion in worthless statistically-significant results. As a result, psychology has moved further and further away from anything resembling an intelligent grasp of human nature. </p>
<p>Psychologists can&#8217;t afford to go under the hoods of cars one at a time. So instead they count car colors from a highway overpass. Useless.</p>
<p><strong>Seth: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This</a> cites many studies that disagree with what you say about openness (lack of correlation). For example, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/?&#038;fa=main.doiLanding&#038;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.120.3.323" rel="nofollow">http://psycnet.apa.org/?&#038;fa=main.doiLanding&#038;doi=10.1037/0033-2909.120.3.323</a>. What evidence supports your view (&#8220;hopelessly flawed&#8221;)?</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I think more than 2 out of 14 things match between your insight and progressive education. I am pointing this out not to be a stickler but because I sense a kinship of approach - you might learn from them and them from you.

Also - I have taught a few classes - unfortunately lecture style - and have to say that it&#039;s not strictly correct that one assumes that all students learn the same way. I always tried to explain things many different ways to cover different ways of seeing things and I always was open to questions and thinking things through with students. That being said I agree your approach is better. I didn&#039;t have the authority to make those decisions though.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: What are the other similarities between what I do and progressive education? I looked again at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that list of 14 characteristics of progressive education&lt;/a&gt; and failed to find more similarities. Unless you mean an emphasis on projects and &quot;varied learning resources&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;So do horoscopes&quot;? Your point is unclear. Are you saying that intellectual curiosity (= openness) as measured by self-report personality tests, doesn&#039;t correlate with anything important? If so, that&#039;s an interesting and surprising claim, which I haven&#039;t heard before. What do you base it on?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Paragraph six of the Halmos article says:

&quot;Having stated this extreme position, I’ll rescind it immediately. I know that it is extreme, and I don’t really mean it—but I wanted to be very emphatic about not going along with the view that learning means going to lectures and reading books. If we had longer lives, and bigger brains, and enough dedicated expert teachers to have a student/teacher ratio of 1/1, I’d stick with the extreme views—but we don’t.&quot;

So Halmos is talking about an ideal. Jonathan Shewchuk&#039;s question (above) gets to the heart of issue.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Halmos&#039;s &quot;extreme position&quot; is no use of books and lectures. He recognizes that is impossible. I don&#039;t agree with Halmos&#039;s extreme position. I had few lectures but plenty of reading. I gave in-class public feedback on student presentations (all students could hear what I said about Student X&#039;s presentation), which vaguely resembles lecturing. The essence of what I&#039;m saying doesn&#039;t have much to do with Halmos. It is that a desire to individualize education (= make it different for each student) led me to stop grading. When I did so, things were fine. My students, it turned out, had plenty of motivation from other sources. Grading is so time-consuming and irksome for teachers that this is an interesting outcome.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using a variation of this in some of my Computer Science courses at Bowdoin for years.  The longer I&#039;m here, the more I&#039;m convinced that the specific material in upper level courses is not particularly important, all that matters is student engagement.

		<description><![CDATA[The teacher believed he had to grade on something-- for administrative reasons, I think, and since there were no other Alexander teachers in town and he believed that anyone who showed up would learn, he graded on attendance. He mentioned another Alexander teacher who graded on class notes.

I don&#039;t know why (I thought the class was very good), but it was down to four students by the end.

The reason I brought up the story is that a skilled person concluded that students weren&#039;t at their best if they were being graded.

Any suggestions for other systems developed from self-observation and experimentation? Offhand, I can think of Bob Cooley&#039;s resistance stretching, Gerda Alexander&#039;s Eutonics (no relation FM Alexander), and Kenny Werner&#039;s Effortless Mastery (cultivating efficiency and intensity for playing music).

Txomin, you&#039;re arguing that students can be demotivated by lowish grades, which is not the same thing as saying that they will be motivated by a chance at high grades.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Thanks for clarifying that. To answer your question (&quot;any suggestions...&quot;) lots of weight-loss diets have been developed by self-observation and experimentation. South Beach, for example.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course it&#039;s true that simple facts (e.g., the Capitol of Texas) can be learned through imitation or memorization.  However, I would submit that one cannot learn _to do_ anything (e.g., drive a car) except through trial and error (hopefully, fairly minor errors).  You can learn that the ignition does X, the accelerator does Y, and brakes do Z through imitation or memorization, but you can&#039;t learn not to over-steer or over-break except by doing it and correcting your (hopefully small) errors.

Anyway, here&#039;s a Quaker school link, note in particular the section on evaluation:  http://www.cfsnc.org/page.cfm?p=421

You might also be interested in the overall philosophy, as it&#039;s very close to some of what you&#039;ve written here: http://www.cfsnc.org/page.cfm?p=362

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the links. The part about evaluation says in part: &quot;Student evaluation at CFS is constant and thorough and is not reduced to letter grades.&quot; This is not a good description of my approach because I was not &quot;constant and thorough&quot;. At the very end, I gave a lot of feedback about term projects. Before that, I gave considerably less feedback. After a class presentation, I would point out one thing I thought was good and one thing where there was room for improvement. I did not give each presentation a thorough critique. That would have taken too long and been overwhelming.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you see any element of this I could apply in my 530-student Data Structures class (now in progress at Berkeley)?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Maybe next time I&#039;m in Berkeley we can talk about this over coffee. My short answer is: 1. Give students substantial length of time (such as 4 weeks) for a final project, which can be anything they like involving the course material. Have teaching assistants vet each project for appropriate degree of difficulty. The final project will get an A so long as the student completes each of the promised elements. Each student gives a progress report to the class each week in section. No lectures during this period. Lecture time devoted to the best progress reports. 2. Make the final project involve improving the data structure for someone on campus (student, professor, staff). I don&#039;t know if this is feasible. 3. Make the final project involve improving the data structure for someone off campus (e.g., parents, friends of parents). Again, I don&#039;t know if this is feasible. The general idea is to introduce freedom (option 1) and realism (options 2 and 3) and reduce worry about grades (option 1).&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi seth! 
I just happened upon your blog through an internet search...and I wasn&#039;t sure how to contact you about a post you had written, but you had closed the comments on, so I apologize. 
Let me tell you just a wee bit about myself. I am a mom of 6 who returned to school as a biology major with the inclination to teach secondary education. I was diagnosed celiac a year ago and have had digestive issues most of my life. I have found myself leaning more toward paleo eating and am intrigued by fermented foods to heal the gut. So here is my question...in one of your posts you discuss why you believe these bacterium are good for our guts and why the human race tends toward these flavours...but why does our stomach acid not kill these bacterium? Why is it all not killed prior to hitting the intestines? 
Feel free to email be directly, should you wish. I am in the beginning stages of food fermentation, beginning with kombucha and on my way to sauerkraut and traditional polish borscht.
Thanks in advance!!
Alena

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Stomach acid kills only what is on the surface. We do not atomize our food in our mouths. It goes into our stomach in lumps. What&#039;s inside the lumps is safe from the acid.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Very intelligent and conscientious people are selected for by Tsinghua admissions system. These people are intellectually curious, and will produce higher quality work when given freedom.

IQ and (Big Five) Conscientiousness are very weakly positively, or actually negatively correlated. Big Five Openness, a pretty much exact math to &#039;intellectually curious&#039;, has only a weak correlation with IQ (IIRC 0.2).

Given the extreme selection from the Chinese population to produce the Tsinghua student body, using tests that test pretty much only IQ &amp; Conscientiousness from every description I&#039;ve heard of them, there&#039;s no reason to expect an extreme level of Openness in the student body.

So perhaps Roberts is merely seeing what a little freedom looks like when applied to the most elite &amp; capable. I&#039;d question whether they performed as well in that respect as comparable students from Harvard or Oxford, except I think Tsinghua is more selective than either...]]></description>
