		<description><![CDATA[Great reminders! Although it may seem like common sense, I always forget these tips. Especially when I&#039;m so eager to just be done with my writing and I don&#039;t wait 24 hours to edit. 

Thanks for the tips!

		<description><![CDATA[Like Alex, I don&#039;t understand the &quot;write as you speak&quot; advice.  Perhaps it would be good advice for the minority of people who become overly formal in their writing.  But most people don&#039;t speak well at all.

I find that experience in writing has changed my speech, because I spend a lot of my writing time thinking about how to say things clearly.  For example, I use the passive voice when speaking much less than I used to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Begin with something interesting . . . I never read the first paragraph, usually most articles begin with the second paragraph. Like starting a speech with a joke, I think the audience is a little sick of this approach. You might want to save the interesting open for later.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: As I told my students, one &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; (magazine) editor would routinely cross out the first paragraph of stuff given to him to edit. I often do that. I also agree about jokes. Bad idea to begin with a joke. It is as if you have nothing actually interesting to say.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used to help organize an annual writing contest for high school students.  The judges (myself included) had to grade hundreds of essays on a scale of one to ten.  I was often stunned by the other judges&#039; grades.  Essays that I thought were fabulous would receive mediocre scores, and execrable essays would score highly.  So, with regard to application essays, you are at the mercy of some drone (or drones) in the admissions office.

&lt;i&gt;Write as you speak&lt;/i&gt;.  I think that&#039;s bad advice.
