		<description><![CDATA[uh seth, your arithmetic is completely wrong.  if you have a life expectancy of 40 years from now, you don&#039;t have a constant 2.5% chance of dying each year.  you have a small chance of dying in your 40s, a somewhat larger chance of dying in your 50s, and so on. if i&#039;m 40 and healthy my chance of dying in my 40s is pretty low - i don&#039;t know exactly but maybe 3%? say that goes to 15%. that means an 85% chance of making it to 50 - already a 48.5 life expectancy, and that&#039;s if everyone kicked at 50, so it&#039;s quite quite a bit larger.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Right. It was an approximation to give a rough idea of what the answer would be.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Let’s say you’re 40 years old and your expected total lifespan is 80 years. Then you have a roughly 1/40 chance of dying each year. If you have a 5/40 chance of dying each year, your expected total lifespan goes down to 48 years — a loss of 32 years of life.&lt;/i&gt;

But this 40-year-old doesn&#039;t face a 1/40 chance of dying in Year 1. His risk of death starts out far below 1/40 in his early 40s and end up far above 1/40 in his late 70s. I doubt that quintupling the death rate would really push his life expectancy below 50, although I don&#039;t have the patience (or, really, the skill) to work it out mathematically.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Paul Jaminet&#039;s new edition of The Perfect Health Diet discusses the health effects of disrupted circadian rhythms. I wonder if, particularly in the case of cancer deaths, what&#039;s showing up in the data as an association between sleeping pills and death is that people with disturbed circadian rhythms are more likely to use sleeping pills.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Yes, that is possible. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=206050&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;, however, &quot;sleeping pill use was associated with significantly increased mortality after control for reported sleep durations and insomnia.&quot; &lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering about the big risks of hypnotic drugs study-- &quot; Data were adjusted for age, gender, smoking, body mass index, ethnicity, marital status, alcohol use and prior cancer&quot;. The data wasn&#039;t matched for sleep problems, so it&#039;s possible that the drugs aren&#039;t more dangerous than insomnia.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree. What&#039;s also possible, and plausible, is that sleeping pills increase mortality by a large amount. I don&#039;t know of any study showing that insomnia is associated with anything close to the same increase in mortality.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this. I am incapable of sleeping more than six hours per night. It&#039;s just the way I am. I used to worry about it, but then I decided to embrace it and use those extra hours in the morning for self improvement. I take on-line courses, sometimes watching the lectures on a treadmill at the gym. My only problem is that my physician thinks I (and everyone else) need 8 hours per night. I am continually being offered sleeping pills. I prefer not to take them, and it&#039;s good to know my instincts are basically correct.]]></description>
