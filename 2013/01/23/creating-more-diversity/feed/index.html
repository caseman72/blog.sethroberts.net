		<description><![CDATA[Christopher Burd, I&#039;m not so sure that would be enough to explain the disparity, but I do think plain bigotry explains a lot of this.  I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s assumed that a non-Jewish white kid from Idaho must (apart from basking in the glow of his Christian white privilege) spit tobacco, wear a cross and carry around a pitchfork when he&#039;s not hunting or trying to find black people to harass or lynch. That abstract image is very easy to hate for someone who still (amazingly) maintains some group victim status, and sees that guy as an enemy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My understanding that the pro-Jewish bias is actually a bias against certain classes of non-Jewish whites. A study a couple of years ago suggested that anything suggesting a conservative orientation (e.g., membership in Young Farmers of America) was the kiss of death for applicants. Obviously, this bias would hit non-Jewish whites far more heavily than Jews. I wonder how applicants with an obvious Orthodox or Hassidic background fare against Evangelical Christians.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To be clear, if you actually read Unz&#039; paper (it&#039;s about 45 pages if you print), there is heavy, heavy discrimination against Asians and non-Jewish whites at the Ivy level. And there is basically AA for white Jews as well as the standard groups known to benefit from AA.  

Now we all knew Asians were getting screwed and we all knew whites got screwed, but the surprising parts of his paper are just how bad Asians and non-Jewish whites get hosed, and how much a boost Jewish whites get for being Jewish. 

This latter claim was certainly the most shocking, as I had always assumed Jewish overrepresentation in all academic circles awas simply due to cognitive and/or personality differences, but you can&#039;t come away from reading Unz&#039; paper and still believe that&#039;s the case for the Ivy league schools at present.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: I agree with all this. Let me add that Unz also makes a point similar to mine: That elite schools, while claiming to want diverse students, do a poor job of reaching that goal. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: I&#039;ve looked over some of his writings, and his main point seems to be that Ivy Leagues discriminate against Asians, much as they used to discriminate against Jews.  He does complain a bit about seemingly lower standards for Jews nowadays, but a lot of people have pointed out that he&#039;s conflating Jews with &quot;half-Jews&quot;, and the relative numbers of those two groups has changed dramatically in recent decades.

Details aside, I&#039;m amazed that in the age of affirmative action and discrimination against Asians, that anyone could claim discrimination in *favor* of whites.  It doesn&#039;t seem mathematically possible!  (But maybe I missed something.)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You mean &quot;discrimination AGAINST (non-Jewish) whites&quot;? Or do you mean &quot;discrimination in favor of Jewish whites&quot;? I don&#039;t understand your point. Discrimination against Asians obviously favors someone else, why not whites? Or Jews?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[D- got a link for that or are you just spouting nonsense?  I&#039;ve never heard of Ivy League admissions being *easier* on whites, let alone Jews.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That Ivy League admissions are &quot;easier on Jews&quot; is one of Unz&#039;s main points. His data revealed this. Maybe he was also surprised, I forget.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of a quote from Alain de Botton (I&#039;m paraphrasing)

There is nothing like climbing to the top that convinces people that the system is working.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Or being born at the top.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still reeling from the Unz piece.  In particular, our current &quot;elites&quot;, who are not the old elites. Depressing...
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: Unz complains (and I agree with him) about Harvard admissions. As my post indicates, I also wonder about the quality of teaching at Harvard and other elite schools. People often complain about groupthink (everyone thinking the same) at the top of our government. I&#039;ve heard the same complaint about the French government: Everyone at the top went to the same school and thinks the same.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
