		<description><![CDATA[Yes. I have limited space in my kitchen, so I need to pick and choose what I use, and it revolves around my diet. I like stews and soups and braises, so a slow cooker is essential, but not a panini maker because I don&#039;t really like sandwiches. And, as my ideas about food changes - I am slowly becoming a paleo and fermented fan - I&#039;m sure my equipment will change. My friends and I now have 6 gallon plastic buckets to make our sourkraut. I&#039;ve a fan of only using what I need (although my closet tells me otherwise) but it&#039;s really hard to do so when we live in a culture that rewards stuff for the sake of stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps you realize, but stagnation ala TC is not about what you actually have, but what you could get. Nothing you list is new, and if anything it&#039;s evidence of stagnation. Soup, Yogurt, Kombucha, Tea, etc—not new. Nor are the various apparati you cite new (except perhaps to you), with the one exception being your own nose clipping discovery. The whole point is that once you invest glass jars (&quot;pick the low-hanging fruit&quot;), they prove pretty hard to improve. And gallon glass jars have been around since the 1800&#039;s. 

Maybe your point is that despite stagnation in the latter sense, there is still room for plenty of individual improvement in quality of life?
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: What I wrote has a non-trivial point. My kitchen changed because my ideas about what to eat improved. That&#039;s progress. Other people&#039;s kitchens did not change at least partly because -- my example makes clear -- their ideas about what to eat did not change. In other words, underneath the technological stagnation noticed by TC and others lies scientific stagnation -- in particular, stagnation in our understanding of health. I don&#039;t think that has been obvious to people who write about stagnation and its causes. Sure, my new ideas led me to choose from existing stuff in new ways. But as the new ideas (e.g., about fermented food) spread, new technologies will come along that do a better job of using those ideas.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

You can get almost the same result as a steam oven, with this no-knead method and a cast iron pot

No Knead Bread.&lt;/a&gt;

A google search of Mark Bittman and no-knead bread will come up with a few interesting variations on this technique, but the cast iron pot is always the &quot;steam oven&quot;

I suppose a bread machine - or even a domestic range - could be made with a steam &quot; system&quot; - but that sounds expensive for  home kitchen equipment.  

And there&#039;s nothing to break, leak or become obsolete with the pot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My favorite new kitchen technology is my sous vide cooker.  The custardy eggs you get when you heat them at 148 F for an hour are superb.  The way it tenderizes short ribs and chuck roast and anything with cartilege is amazing.  And I like that I can leave a roast in it and take it out anywhere between 8 and 48 hours later, still cooked medium, so I don&#039;t have to know in advance when I&#039;ll be eating.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the suggestion.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the topic of kitchen innovation, I think the focus on &quot;equipment&quot; has led to a lack of innovation on &quot;food&quot; and even true &quot;cooking&quot;

Here&#039;s a great article from Mark Bittman of the NY Times on the topic&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/weekinreview/14bittman.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Your kitchen is tiny - so what&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ;

&quot;I asked my friend the chef Mario Batali what he thought about all this[people dispariging my small kitchen and basic equipment]. “Only bad cooks blame the equipment,” he said. “I can make almost every dish in my restaurants on four crummy electric burners with a regular oven — as can just about anyone else who cares to.”

I couldn&#039;t agree more.  The focus on bigger kitchens, with more stuff, has moved the focus from the food itself. It has allowed people to own more gadgets and buy and store more varieties of prepared/processed foods in larger volumes (often resulting in spillage and waste) while the overall quality (and knowledge) of home food preparation has decreased.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An approximate American equivalent of the soup cooker is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vitaclaychef.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VitaClay Chef&lt;/a&gt;

It has an unglazed clay crock, can be set at various temperatures, from slow cooking pot roasts, to rice cooking, to yoghurt making.  For pot roasts, it cooks faster than crock pots, and then decreases the temperature, too keep it warm but no overcooked.  Also has programmable delayed start and a few other good features.

I bought one of these for my partner for Xmas.  Both she and I are long time crock pot users and we both agree this is better, and produces better tasting food, than any of our crockpots.  We have used the yoghurt setting for making kefir, and also for sourdoughing bread.

I am normally not a fan of countertop plug in appliances (other than the kettle), but this one has earned its place in my kitchen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth&#039;s point makes more sense. None of his new equipment sounds very expensive. His kitchen changed because what he eats changed, not because he has more money.

Professional chefs may buy immersion circulators, blow torches, French tops, pressure cookers, and blast chillers, but they need to be on the bleeding edge to prepare great tasting food extremely quickly. Most people would not, regardless of how much they made.

Maybe the Romneys have a blast chiller and an immersion circulator, but I wouldn&#039;t bet on it.]]></description>
