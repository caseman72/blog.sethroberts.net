		<description><![CDATA[As an undergraduate I found most chemistry lectures dull but chem lab satisfying.  I found many physics lectures interesting but most physics lab dull.  I enjoyed maths lectures and also enjoyed doing computer programming.

I don&#039;t offhand see any particular pattern there.  But I did feel sorry for my friends who were on courses that seemed to involve only learning by listening, reading and writing, and no learning by doing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thinking out loud:

I can&#039;t help but wonder how that would work in a more technical class. At the end of the class can you execute proofs or write programs in C or multiply numbers?

I suppose there&#039;s a case to be made for that fact that the current system of education in STEM subjects seems to favor a tiny minority of white males.

I&#039;m working in software engineering. A huge part of our jobs is combining a bunch of people&#039;s backgrounds, having a lot of conversations, and finally executing on something, whatever best idea we could come up with. The execution is sometimes a surprisingly small part of the job. Yet that background in technical knowledge has to come from somewhere and you either have it or don&#039;t. What you also sometimes have or don&#039;t is the ability to use that background effectively with others.

That said, I can see the value in a class where you &quot;go make something, like with a computer or whatever.&quot; And I wonder how much background students would have needed to &quot;cover&quot; before we all could be confident that they&#039;d succeed at something.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: see my next post for an answer to this question.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you never had students who were unmotivated and didn&#039;t perform well on the unstructured projects that you assigned?  I&#039;m not proud of it, but I have to say that the threat of bad grades kept me from slacking in many of the classes I took.  There were so many potential distractions in my life, all competing for my attention.  I&#039;m not sure that I would have done well in high school and college if all my classes were free-form.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;ve only tried not grading once. In this particular case, nobody performed poorly. What I conclude is there are other powerful motivators besides grades. One is an innate desire to learn. Another is a desire to look good to your peers (in class presentations). Maybe your teachers never made good use of these two motivations.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
