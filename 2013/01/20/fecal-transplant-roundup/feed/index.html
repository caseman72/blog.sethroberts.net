		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for referencing my website FecalTransplant.org. A quick note I wanted to make was that I used Fecal Transplant to cure myself of Ulcerative Colitis, which was not caused by Clostridium Difficile bacteria. 

Most of the studies that are now making headlines in the United States are for its application for c. diff bacteria, however its uses go far beyond just that bacterial infection, but also to diseases like Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn&#039;s Disease that are not recognized as being caused by bacterial infection by doctors in the U.S. It is my belief that many disease currently known as autoimmune disorders are actually caused by infection by an unknown pathogen.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s an interesting idea. Is there evidence for it? I might put it differently. That many diseases are caused by UNDERINFECTION, a new concept to many doctors.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The horse tale is particularly interesting.  It implies that a fecal transplant can be done via the stomach.  Perhaps, if a sufferer can&#039;t find proper medical transplant, in an emergency they might be able to self-treat by eating feces?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good point. One person uses ice cubes. Which she swallows.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FDA is already blocking innovation here

They want to disallow it until fully controlled by them.

Likewise, FDA fight AGAINST smokeless cigarettes. Unbelievable!
We have a certain killer cigarettes. We have a seemingly safe alternative - synthetic cigarettes. Yet it is &quot;not approved here&quot; and FDA fight against it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The doctor you cited indeed is not familiar with statistics. Though he is right that the sample size is small, the effect is large. Furthermore, he seems to have no clue regarding previous studies. Showing the same effect over and over again creates a different statistic - you cannot simply view one study in isolation. This has been repeatedly critized and led to statisticians proposing non-frequentist (read: Bayesian) statistics for medical research (cf. Goodman, Ann. Intern Med. 1999;130(12):1005-1013). Even when using a pooled analysis (Gough et al., Clin Infect Dis. 2011;53(10):994-1002), the treatment effect is so large that instead of arguing, it calls for immediate development of treatment protocols (i.e. donor eligibility, disease screening of the donor, amount &amp; frequency &amp; mode of delivery of the transplant, ...).
