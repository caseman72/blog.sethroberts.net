		<description><![CDATA[Dear Seth, regarding your practice of delaying breakfast in order to preventearly awakening, does coffee count as breakfast?  I usually drink black unsweetened  coffee (and water) when I wake at 4 or 5am, but otherwise delay food until 11 or 12.  Thanks!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Food with no calories doesn&#039;t count as as breakfast. On the other hand, the effect of caffeine is unclear. It probably causes some sort of anticipation -- whether helpful or harmful, hard to say.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clearly, lead is bad news, and there is experimental evidence it harms health.   No disagreement.   Let&#039;s get the lead out.   That is not the same thing as agreeing that lower lead caused lower crime rates.    Here is some pushback from Jim Manzi:

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I read Nature of Economies after being introduced to some of her economic views on this blog, and I was blown away.  It&#039;s the closest thing to a general theory of economics that I&#039;ve ever come across.  Reading Antifragility by Nassim Taleb, I can detect a strong Jacobs influence in his tendency to look to mother nature for economic guidance.  But it&#039;s tragic that her influence hasn&#039;t made a dent in mainstream thinking.  Probably due to the fact that her bottom-up views don&#039;t leave much room for economic planners.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I believe that Taleb, who is also anti-planner, is having more of an influence than Jacobs ever had. Maybe the Internet has a democratizing effect. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
