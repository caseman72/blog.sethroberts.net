		<description><![CDATA[RE: Ed.

Yes, I think it could work online.  Of course most of the interest in online learning comes from the idea of scale. I get a bit of scale in what I do in that I can do more independent studies and so forth than most professors, but that pales when compared to the kind of scaling people are excited about for things like Coursera.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for posting this. This style of teaching sounds like it would do well for an online or online/ in person mix type of class structure, where the teacher would meet with the student one on one online, instead of the typical one to many power point presentation.

Do you think that this style of teaching could happen online?

Thanks]]></description>
