		<description><![CDATA[seth, while i have your ear, one question i always had was why the size of the window was supposed to be an hour.  how did you arrive at this - why isn&#039;t it half an hour or 45 mins or two hours or 15 mins or whatever?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Rat studies suggested the flavor and calories must be ingested no further apart than an hour to become associated. It&#039;s meant to give the idea rather than be ironclad. I forget the details of the studies.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Seth.  I was thinking the same thing, that the fats (the right ones) are good for you in other ways.  The down side is that a sugar source, before mixed with water, is much more portable than most fats. Which makes the diet easier for travel and work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting compilation of info/comments.  Any data or thoughts on whether a  fat works better/the same/less well than using a sugar as you did when you devised SLD?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good fats work much better than sugar because of the positive side effects (better skin, sleep, brain, less inflammation). Sugar does not improve skin, etc. I have blogged, with data, many times about the last three (sleep, brain, inflammation). The skin improvement produced by the fat is obvious.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth. Hello from Mexico!

I stumbled upon SLD while reading Freakonomics a couple of weeks ago and I have been doing great. It&#039;s a life changing thing and a total revolution. But I will write to you about that in a couple of months, after I get more results with my experiments.

I am writing here because of coffee. A few hours after I started SLD (almost 2 weeks ago) my cravings were gone, but not the craving for coffee. I love it and I have invested time and effort to become an &quot;expert&quot;.

I would drink up to 3 liters of coffee in a regular morning. 

But not today. Just as my craving for food disappeared a week ago, my craving for coffee is gone today. I just had a couple of cups. 

So here&#039;s a crazy and non-scientific theory of mine: Could it be that the cravings for coffee (and other substances) vanish because people doing SLD learn to disassociate taste from food? Or taste from substances? Since taste is no longer in the picture, could it be that coffee loses importance?

I don&#039;t know. Just some thoughts.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for your comments about SLD. That&#039;s good to hear. Your experience with coffee is fascinating. Here&#039;s another possible explanation: Part of your craving for coffee came about because you drank coffee with food. The taste of the coffee became associated with the calories in the food. Take away the food -- because you are eating less -- and the craving for coffee gets weaker.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see plenty of advice to the effect that losing weight can reduce the HbA1c of diabetics, even to the point of apparently curing them.  Do you have many/any people attributing such a result to the SLD?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, haven&#039;t heard many stories like that.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>
