		<description><![CDATA[Seth, thank you for your elaborate response.

I have just finished reading Atul Gawandes &quot;The Cost Conundrum&quot;. As I can only talk for continental-European health care sytems that are still largely driven by non-profits and local and state agencies, I cannot completely follow the &quot;it&#039;s the money&quot; theory; maybe the US is simply not comparable, because of the details of its healthcare &quot;system&quot;[1] or its entrepreneurship culture.
Most colleagues I meet seem to be interested in &quot;not working more than 9 hours a day&quot; and &quot;doing less night-shifts&quot;. Either we have a severe case of all of us lying to each other (and ourselves) or the &quot;it&#039;s the money&quot; theory is deeply insufficient.
If I was lying to myself and went 6 years through med school because I&#039;m a greedy bitch, I&#039;d love to find out how I can stop lying to myself. (No sarcasm here, I&#039;d really appreciate to know every self-deception of my brain.)

For all the insufficiencies that exist in the system, a blog comment will not suffice, as we both know. I&#039;d like to exclusively focus on the &quot;doctors do it because of the money&quot; thing, because from everything I observed, that is not how 99% of us operate. I&#039;ve seen enough greedy folks in the economy department at the university, though. They even admitted to greed.

OK. I will stop here because I don&#039;t want to sound like that whiney blog commentator who loves to argue with the blog owner just to make a point.

Thank you for your time reading and responding to my opinionated emissions.

[1] I am deeply sorry for having to put that word in quotation marks, but you might have noticed that the USA is ridiculed for its healthcare system by virtually every other first world country.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;  If you refuse a treatment (such as a surgery), your doctor may make less money. This pushes doctors to overstate benefits and understate costs.

I&#039;m very much disappointed to hear such talk from a psychologist who should know better. It is a very simple case of extrinsic incentive bias. Doctors don&#039;t do it because of the money -- at least most of them, with your typical greedy bastard here and there.

Why do we doctors overprescribe and overoperate? Most people expect us to, and we have grown to cater to the &quot;do something&quot; mentality. No patient wants to hear simple truths. Health improvement requires actual work on the patients side, such as smoking cessation, getting enough sleep, experiment with your diet etc. Often, the most important thing for your health is not &quot;do something&quot;, but &quot;stop doing something&quot;. (I hear ya, N. Nassim Taleb...)

Most people *want* the easy fix, and we can give it to them. Our big-pharma-sponsored professional institutions and conferences play down any reference to possible harm, even censor or ignore it. Most of us choose to ignore it, too, because most of our colleagues ignore it. And given that the majority says there is no harm, there can&#039;t be! Completely logical, isn&#039;t it?

As a medical professional, I highly recommend seeking medical treatment only if your condition is sufficiently severe. Everything else will quite probably harm you.

Thank you.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Learn more psychology and you will learn that people are often wrong about their motives. So, for example, a doctor is a bad person to ask what motivates doctors. People&#039;s real motives often turn out to be different than what they say, to put it in plain English. The error is always in the direction of making themselves look better -- as you do in your comment. Look at studies on extrinsic motivation bias and you will see that the bias is about stated motives, not actual ones. See Atul Gawande&#039;s article about this (about why there are enormous cost variations in medical care from one place to the next) for evidence against your view that doctors overprescribe and overoperate because &quot;most people expect [them] to&quot;. The differences he found between where health care spending was high and where it was low seemed to be due to differences between the doctors in the two places, not between the patients in the two places. Can you point to any evidence supporting your view (blame the patient)?

&quot;Most of us choose to ignore [possible harm], too, because most of our colleagues ignore it.&quot; Here I agree, psychology research supports this explanation. I also agree that drug company presentations are a plausible initial cause (that is reinforced by conformity).&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I&#039;ve designed instruments I&#039;ve always gone through everything with my instrument maker so that the design can be practical for him to manufacture: it has always led to improvements.  It&#039;s amusing to learn that for GE the penny has only recently dropped.  The next step should be to sack the dimwitted executives who were in charge before.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, I agree. It should not have been the great revelation it apparently was.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
