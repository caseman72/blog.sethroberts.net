		<description><![CDATA[@ jenny,

Coconut oil seems to be one of the single best things you can eat - (in normal eating, not just as the Shangri-La oil) for continued weight management and metabolic health.

I have read the books on it by Bruce Fife and also Mary Enig, lots of good information from those two.  The more of your calories that come from that instead of other fats (or carbs), the more active and leaner you become (applies to farm animals too).  Taken before meals, it suppresses appetite.  Taken with meals, it makes other fats easier to digest.  It stabilises gut flora.  It helps reverse alzheimers.  It is good for your skin. and on and on...

It seems to be one thing that almost everyone - except the seed oil industry and the USDA - agrees is healthy.

2 tablespoons a day seems to be the consensus for an an effective dose.

I take most of mine as chocolate - get 85% cacao and melt with equal amounts of butter and coconut oil, add some stevia and shredded coconut and cool in silicone ice cube trays.  As good as any bought chocolate.

To get the shangri-la effect with this you would have to eat it with your nose pinched, and that&#039;s just a waste of chocolate!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a comment on Alex&#039;s weight loss chart. Has anyone tried using  coconut oil after any method that loses weight, ie low carb or walks, and seeing if that holds the weight loss stable? ie was it specific to following the Shanghri-la diet, or just any method of weight loss?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have also been a Guinea pig to test this software and am close to finishing up my third month.  However, I still quite enjoy doing the test, have had no difficulty doing it at least twice most days, sometimes more.  I&#039;ve also improved over time, as expected (learning effects), and also plateaued at about 6 weeks.  However, I also did some self testing.  I&#039;ll send more detail to Seth later, which he may or may not decide to post here, but I&#039;ve been testing the effects of adding a heaping tablespoon of coconut oil to my coffee every morning.  I&#039;ve turned this treatment on and off several times, and without fail each time I see a large improvement with the CO... I&#039;ve even done some modeling to remove the over time effects and to control for within trial correlation, and the CO effects are still there.  I&#039;m known as an extreme skeptic, but I think these results are real.]]></description>

You might want to consider using free, open source, RStudio server to have a shared R environment. This would allow central tracking by Seth.
