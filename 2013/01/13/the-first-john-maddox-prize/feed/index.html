		<description><![CDATA[Alex,

I suggest you watch the documentary &#039;Voices from the Shadows&#039;. It can be seen here: http://mubi.com/films/voices-from-the-shadows  

another informative website:

If you&#039;re not willing to spend an hour and $3 learning about the condition, you have no right to claim it is psychosomatic.]]></description>
