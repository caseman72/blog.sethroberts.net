		<description><![CDATA[In the United States heart and arteriosclerosis are the leading cause of premature deaths but in Japan deaths due to cardiovascular diseases are insignificant! We have to wonder why! Japanese eat a lot of fish that contains omega 3 oil, a fat known to reduce plaque in the arteries thereby reversing atherosclerosis. Omega 3 unsaturated fats increase the HDL or high-density lipoproteins and their particle size that are essential for keeping the arteries from blocking. Microbiology and biochemistry are very complex sciences and many phenomena are not at all understood. Many anomalies exist. As mentioned above, omega 3 in fish oil reverses artery plaque   yet it contains significant amounts of dietary cholesterol and its molecular is extremely similar!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The French also have a low rate of heart disease -- and they eat much less fish than the Japanese. There is one clear similarity between the French diet and the Japanese diet: Both eat a lot of fermented food, far more than other countries.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The great tinkerer, evolution, developed Cholesterol as an intricate part of the way the human body works over millions of years. To think that medicine can understand the complexities of the situation and improve upon it seems quite arrogant &amp; foolish.

This part seems to recognize that humans are not living as intended:

&quot;In the Diet, Obesity, and Gene (Diogenes) Project, increased protein consumption together with a modest reduction in glycemic index was beneficial for weight control. Substituting protein for carbohydrate also partly resulted in lower blood pressure, improved lipids levels, and concomitantly reduced cardiovascular risk. Higher vitamin D intake might have beneficial effects on the reduction of visceral adipose tissue and other cardiovascular risk factors.

Another possibility is that lifestyle factors associated with egg consumption might have obscured a positive association between egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. However, regular egg consumption tends to be associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors such as smoking and physical inactivity.&quot;

In other words, eating too much sugar, being inactive, not getting enough vitamin D, &amp; smoking are unnatural &amp; harmful behaviors for humans. I feel 1000% more confident that addressing these 4 things would be more effective &amp; less dangerous than attacking Cholesterol.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: The evidence that high cholesterol causes heart disease is close to zero. Because of this, it is likely that roughly everything mainstream experts say about cholesterol will be wrong. It&#039;s like starting an argument &quot;let&#039;s assume 1 = 0.&quot; With that assumption, you will reach a lot of wrong conclusions.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
