		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for posting this interesting essay, Seth.  It reminds me of Rene Dubos who studied tuberculosis incidence carefully and pointed out that while society in general and the medical profession in particular credited the development of antibiotics with the decline in TB, the decline had actually begun well before antibiotics were in widespread use.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I didn&#039;t know that, but I see that he makes that point in &lt;em&gt;The White Plague&lt;/em&gt;, which I will look at.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the sources that David Grimes cites in his paper is a NHS report with interesting international data. The charts on page 10 in particular. It looks like Ukraine and Russia are in a totally different league in terms of CHD deaths, with 3-4x the incidence per 100,000 compared to the UK. 

http://www.chss.org.uk/pdf/education/student/NSF2005.pdf

And according to this Wikipedia chart, Russia and Ukraine have among the highest smoking rates in the world (and the highest of any countries included in that NHS comparison).

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Indeed Jake, the curve of CHD and tobacco consumption is almost identical (ramp up to a peak in the 60s/70s, rapid decline since).&quot;  That suggests to me that it ain&#039;t tobacco - if it were I&#039;d expect a lag.

If the CHD curve declines just as much for countries where smoking hasn&#039;t declined much, then that would be pretty conclusive disproof.  Worth a look?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, thanks. I hope you&#039;ll comment or post about how the lecture looks to you. It looks plausible to me, but it&#039;s also very much in line with how I&#039;d expect the world to work.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The stuff about HIIT is good and what interests me. The stuff about &quot;adverse effects&quot; is all wrong -- the analysis is too simple.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About four years ago, I went to a lecture by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn (cardiologist from the Cleveland Clinic).  He argued that all oils &amp; fats are bad for your heart.  He advocates an extremely low-fat vegan diet.  He showed radiograms showing cardiac arteries before and after his diet.  The improvements were substantial.

I don&#039;t know if he&#039;s right or not, and my own diet is not low in fat by any means.  But I&#039;m raising this issue because his data was not epidemiological in nature.  The cardiac arteries were from the same patient, taken at two different points in time.

Here&#039;s Esselstyn&#039;s site:

http://www.heartattackproof.com/resolving_cade.htm

He also talked about a test called the Brachial Artery Tourniquet Test, which measures the time it takes for an artery to recover following physical compression of it.  Esselstyn claimed that this test can be used to show the harmful effects of eating oils and fats.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Esselstyn gives convincing evidence that his diet is better than what his subjects were eating before. Of course, his diet is a huge change from what they were eating before. I have no idea what part or parts of that change made a difference. Did his subjects improve because they ate less of Chemical X? Did they improve because they ate more of Chemical Y? There are hundreds of Xs and Ys involved. In contrast, my butter experiment changed one thing (butter). Sure, butter has several parts, but it is not a massive change. And I am not making claims about components of butter.&lt;/strong&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading with interest a blog by an economist interested in ancestral health and he has been posting studies showing butter has a negative impact on flow-mediated dilation which he uses as a marker of heart health.  Interesting contrasting those studies with your findings of improved brain function and heart exams.

http://www.mattmetzgar.com/2013/05/why-is-butter-bad.html

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: As far as I know, it hasn&#039;t been established that butter IS bad overall. I think my brain function test can be taken as an overall measure of brain health (because it correlates with several other measures) but I don&#039;t think the same can be said for flow-mediated dilation -- that it is a good measure of overall heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
