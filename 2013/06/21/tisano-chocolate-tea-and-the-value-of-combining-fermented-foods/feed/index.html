		<description><![CDATA[It could be that some foods come together at a certain level and further complexity doesn&#039;t help.  I described before my doubts that adding a fermented food would improve my guacamole, but I haven&#039;t run that tasting session yet.  

As for lassi, the standard additions are one or more of fruit, salt, spices, sweetener.    It would be interesting to try adding a sweet white wine, or cold brewed black tea, or chocolate.  (I can&#039;t add chocolate due to an allergy, but you could try.)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Adding wine to lassi is a good idea, I&#039;ll try it. Guacamole is a good test case. If it doesn&#039;t benefit from a more complex flavor, that would puzzle me.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed that most recipes fail to use multiple fermented foods.  There are a few exceptions, such as the Reuben sandwich, which uses three fermented foods: corned beef, cheese, and sauerkraut.  Also those sandwiches made with a true sour-dough bread, cheese, and a fermented meat.

I also suspect it is why cheeseburgers are popular: the cheese along with the ketchup or mustard (both of which typically are made with vinegar.)

Then there are the complex salads using cheese, fermented meat, and fermented olives, dressed with a vinaigrette.  

I use combinations of fermented foods all the time in my cooking.  I really appreciate you discovering this technique and writing about it.  I&#039;ve read cookbooks for many years and the only one who came close to this idea was the guy who said most soups can be improved by adding cheese.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good points. I was making lassi yesterday and thought: what should I add? Vinegar? No, I thought, it&#039;s already sour. I failed to appreciate the vinegar (e.g., balsamic vinegar) could add complexity.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
