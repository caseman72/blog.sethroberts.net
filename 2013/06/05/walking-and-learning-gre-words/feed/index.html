		<description><![CDATA[Seth: When you write, &quot;Best combination: lying on stomach, heavy metal,&quot; did you mean &quot;best for studying&quot; or &quot;best for triggering sleep&quot;?  Which combo was best for triggering sleepiness?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Best for studying. In that situation she could study the most words before falling asleep.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find that at home I can&#039;t concentrate enough to listen to a podcast (unless I&quot;m cooking or doing something else that doesn&#039;t require the language part of my brain). I&#039;m fine in a car too. It may not be walking so much as having two things going on at the same time.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I see what you mean. Here the improved activity is visual (using Anki) rather than auditory (listening to a podcast). When your eyes are busy (with Anki), it isn&#039;t clear what else you can do besides walk. So it isn&#039;t clear how to test your explanation. Psychologists usually assume limited capacity -- doing X makes it harder to do Y. Of course walking takes no brain power but it&#039;s not obvious at all why it should make it easier to do something else (Anki) that does require brain power.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was studying for the GRE I would take a vocabulary book with me on my daily hikes. I ended up scoring in the 98th percentile on the verbal section. I&#039;m not sure if memorizing words while hiking increased the quality of my studying. But it was enjoyable enough that it almost definitely increased the quantity of my studying. I would have never been able to sit at home and memorize words for 1-2 hours a day.]]></description>
