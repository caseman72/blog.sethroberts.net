		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth 

Not sure if you have seen this:

Sunshine Could Benefit Health and Prolong Life, Study Suggests
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130507195807.htm

The effect appears to be due to increased nitric oxide level and may 
not be related to vitamin D levels.

All the Best]]></description>

Seth, re: urbanization, I should have added that the 2010 census found that African Americans have subsequently been moving out of urban areas, reversing the earlier concentration:

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: I am a long time reader and huge fan of your blog. Thank you so much for all you bring to the community.

I&#039;m particularly interested in understanding these issues related to diet, but at the same time feel the same frustration that--I assume--many others feel because people with credible credentials seem to be taking diametrically opposed positions on issues that are crucial to my day to day decisions regarding my diet. Decisions on questions like, &quot;how often should I eat eggs?&quot; &quot;how much sun should I expose myself too?&quot; 

A google search on Stephanie Seneff turned up (1) a number of interesting powerpoint presentations and essays but also (2) at least one blog post, from someone who appeared to have relevant background in nutrion, who was extremely critical of her approach and her claims. http://carbsanity.blogspot.com/2012/03/low-fat-vitd-and-stephanie-seneff.html

Of course, the fact that someone, somewhere has criticized her does not mean she&#039;s wrong. But I find myself very frustrated trying to evaluate all of this and would appreciate your take.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I find CarbSane&#039;s criticism unconvincing. I do not get alarmed that someone &quot;learned from Gary Taubes&quot;. I do not consider it a big deal that Seneff&#039;s Ph.d. is in a different area. I don&#039;t care whether Seneff&#039;s blog has &quot;a feminist angle&quot;. I suppose my take is: ignore ad homineum criticism.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is further illuminated by the experience of cardiologist William Davis (also author of Wheat Belly), who has found great success reversing arterial calcification with a protocol that includes D3 supplementation until blood levels reach 60-70.

This is a link to his greatest circulatory calcification turnaround &quot;success story&quot;:
http://www.trackyourplaque.com/forum/topics.aspx?ID=7520

Interestingly, the individual who improved so much is an African American male who upon starting the program had NO measurable Vitamin D in his blood. Yep, ZERO.

African Americans are known to be more susceptible to heart disease than whites, and they are also known to produce less D in response to a given level of sunlight. This makes me wonder is another possible confounder of the heart disease epidemic (in addition to latitude) is an increasingly urbanized black and brown population (with concomitant undiagnosed low D3 status) in northern cities.

Of course, this issue is risky for a professional scientist to study, as even looking into the matter could end a career.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;increasingly urbanized black and brown population&quot;...the incidence of heart disease is going down, not up. Your possible confounder is changing in the wrong direction.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
