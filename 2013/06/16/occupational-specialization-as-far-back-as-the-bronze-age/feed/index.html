&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Well, yes, but surely you&#039;ve heard the term &quot;meritocracy&quot;. Those who believe in it inevitably think highly of one-dimensional measures of achievement, such as IQ scores. Somehow merit is one-dimensional.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Professional specialization far predates that. 
See the Sumerian proverbs from the Oxford ETSCL project: you find professionalized makers of clothing (fullers who make felt, weavers) and scribes and temple workers, and even a hierarchy of disgrace:

A disgraced singer becomes a flute-player. A disgraced lamentation priest becomes a piper. A disgraced merchant becomes a con-man. A disgraced carpenter becomes a man of the spindle. A disgraced smith becomes a man of the sickle. A disgraced mason becomes a hod-carrier.&lt;/a&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I can recommend the 1958 &quot;The Decipherment of Linear B&quot; by John Chadwick, who had taken part in that decipherment.  The hero of his account is Michael Ventris, an architect by trade who had not gone to university.  Ventris was the real thing, a genius, and I don&#039;t mean &quot;genius&quot; in the grade-inflated US sense.

Chadwick had worked with Ventris and so his portrait of him and his working methods is  authoritative.  Inside my copy of the book I&#039;ve found a cutting of a review of a biography of Ventris by Andrew Robinson; the cutting is dated April 2002.  &quot;The Man Who Deciphered Linear B: The Story of Michael Ventris&quot; (Thames and Hudson).  Here&#039;s one quotation from the review &quot;it is a testament to the remarkable level of education available in some schools before the Second World War that Ventris left Stowe (a term early ...) with a degree of fluency in Latin and Greek not matched by most of today&#039;s graduates in Classics.&quot;]]></description>
