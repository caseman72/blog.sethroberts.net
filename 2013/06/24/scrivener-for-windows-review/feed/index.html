		<description><![CDATA[Scrivener is meant for novelists and screenwriters. It&#039;s not going to provide a big advantage unless you&#039;re making book-sized documents (or trilogies) out of elements that group naturally into scenes and characters.

Flipped bits due to ECC are not yet a major cause of bugs. I run large bioinformatics program on a computer without ECC. A typical run requires every bit out of 50,000,000,000 bytes in the files to be correct, and fails about once a month due to a flipped bit.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree about Scrivener. I am puzzled that James Fallows, who is not a novelist or screenwriter, likes it so much.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Along the lines of Alex Chernavsky&#039;s comment, I also noticed, starting in the mid 1980&#039;s that many people, rather bizarrely, don&#039;t mind buggy software.  At the time I thought it was because people who hadn&#039;t much computer experience were likely to blame themselves more than the software.

In 2013, it seems that explanation is implausible because people have had decades to become familiar with computer use and to better attribute blame.  My revised explanation is that buggy software doesn&#039;t bother many salaried workers because their salary is in the short-run unaffected by inefficiency.

As for Word and Windows, both of which I find quite reliable, I wonder if the fact that parity memory and ECC doesn&#039;t seem to be present in the computers most people buy may have something to do with the residual level of dissatisfaction we may be left with.  Big programs face more memory error risk.  Failures I&#039;ve encountered in recent years seem less repeatable and so I have revised upward my estimate that they are caused by flipped-bits.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You have the word science twice and experiment once in your blog title and you&#039;re still with windows??? I switched to linux ages ago and have not looked back for even half a second. It&#039;s faster, better, easier and these days has a great community to help with the learning curve.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: An R program I need is only available for Windows. I also need to use Windows because my students use it..&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried it for a couple of days and hated it, but for different reasons. Everyone&#039;s process is differnt,  and I tend to the organic and paper notes, Also, I didn&#039;t need another learning curve in my life,  and Scrivener is both buggy and not entirely intuitive. Last is the import from word issue, which is no problem at all in InDesign or even Wordpress. I&#039;ll stick to notebooks and paper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve only used Scrivener (Mac) for one project -- a big legal research paper -- and I thought it was great. All my work originated in the program, so I didn&#039;t have to import anything. Also, I know a number of different writers who swear by the program. Fallows aside, non-techy types seem to love it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Try OpenOffice or LibreOffice free/open source word processors.They have most of the features of MS Word and save files in many formats. Upgrades are always free and you&#039;re encouraged to share the program. Versions for Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating system. Works for me. Check it out. Free as in speech and free as in beer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Slightly off topic but I highly recommend learning Markdown and a short spell forcing yourself to create documents in it exlusively.

Using Markdown you can create documents in any simple text editor and it has the added bonus of discouraging you from using extraneous (and time wasting) formatting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What surprises me is the high degree of tolerance that some users exhibit toward crappy software.  At my workplace, we use a cloud-based database management system.  The software is clunky, poorly designed, slow, and hard to use.  The company that makes it is only interested in adding new features, not in fixing problems with the existing features.  And yet... many of my co-workers love the program.

It makes no sense to me.]]></description>
