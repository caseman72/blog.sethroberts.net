		<description><![CDATA[Seth says: &quot;You can do the paperwork once for many patients.&quot; I doubt it. This is the government we&#039;re talking about.

David Johnston says: &quot;Perhaps hospitals could seek out people with excellent poop with optimal therapeutic properties and pay them for their poop.&quot; Poop Banks. Give blood and poop at the same time. (Actually not a bad idea...but could you imagine?)

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;A more persuasive article would have explained why patients who need this treatment cannot be sent to doctors who decide that “hours of paperwork” are doable.&quot;

Because there are very few.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Surely there will be more. You can do the paperwork once for many patients.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

As a career choice, I think it would be much less stressful than my current job designing cryptographic circuits. I could sell home-care packages on the side over ebay.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not everyone responds to the traditional treatment.  Yes, it costs to screen the donor but one 10-day supply of Difficid is $3800.  Vancomycin is not much cheaper, and doctors are leaving patients on it for months and then we relapse as soon as it is stopped.  

Patients with refractory C Diff who have not responded to the antibiotics are going to die, deaths that could have been prevented.

Has anyone talked about the FDA getting pressured by Big Pharma to stop fecal transplants so the drug companies can recoup the monies they have spent on bringing these drugs to market, even though they don&#039;t always work?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once again, government meddling and regulation, increasing the cost of healthcare.

As costs continue to rise, medical vacations to Mexico and Central America will become more reasonable (dental care in Mexico is already more reasonable) and common.
