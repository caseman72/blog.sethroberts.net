		<description><![CDATA[Yes, with a pen on my skin. No, the bigger problem is that it smudges and fades. So I refresh it. Also writing on the upper wrist results in less ink loss than writing on the top of the hand, which I was doing previously.

		<description><![CDATA[Agree with everything noted. Except the limitation is doing it at a desk. Do it with a pen on your upper wrist instead. I track major strategic wins towards the next life level on the right wrist, with a short acronym summarizing the current objective. On the right wrist, I have &quot;SOG&quot; which stands for &quot;sh-t&quot; &quot;OK&quot; &quot;good&quot;. I make hashes for each performance level throughout the day. The SOG ratings are relative to yesterday&#039;s performance. &quot;Good&quot; means better than yesterday&#039;s average. So it drives continuous performance improvement, and is an easily viewable &quot;life dashboard&quot; for the day. 

Then I download to a journal at the end of the day. It gamifies life, which is cool.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Very interesting. You write with pen on your skin? I would think that would be hard to wash off completely. If not what do you write on?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
