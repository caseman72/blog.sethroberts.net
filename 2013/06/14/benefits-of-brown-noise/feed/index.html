		<description><![CDATA[I found this comment on Wiki interesting: &quot; Its spectral density is inversely proportional to f², meaning it has more energy at lower frequencies . . . the sound is a low roar resembling a waterfall or heavy rainfall.&quot;  I&#039;m a new father and in one of the books on helping babies sleep, the author recommended using noise like a rainfall; however, he recommended using quality speakers with deep base because the base was very relaxing to children (and adults).  He said to mimic what a baby in utero hears, turn on your bath water and fill the tub- now stick your head under the water and listen to the difference in base between running water and the deep tumbling sound you hear while submerged.  That&#039;s what a baby is used to hearing in utero.  I wonder if this brown noise is important because of the deeper base sounds than white noise which can be static-y.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried several of the generated noises . . .rain, brown, uptempo . . . they just made me nervous.  I&#039;m glad they work for others here, but for me, I prefer either quiet or specific musicians.  For example, when cutting code, I&#039;ll listen to Sonic Youth.  When my goal is to relax, I play Marconi Union.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve played around a bit with various sound generators over the past few months.

One is the White Noise app from TMSOFT to help focus, mainly by reducing the impact of background noise. One of its nice features is the ability to mix different noise types, eg I often use blue noise and brown noise together, so you get a blend you like.

sox is another useful program  ( http://sox.sourceforge.net/ ) which can be used to generate white noise sound files for use in music players.

Also, I recently came across the FocusAtWill website which claims to have music that helps with concentration ( see https://www.focusatwill.com/science/science-primer/ ) . In my experience it seems to be pretty good for background music while working on a computer - I generally use the UpTempo channel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish you would try and quantify the effect from Brown Noise (on attention, focus, ... whatever). Like you did with Omega-3 and butter.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m thinking of measuring how long I work with and without it. Maybe it allows me to work longer before I need to take a break. I may also measure its effect on my sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow! I&#039;m stuck on grey...the drips in the foreground could be a little lower, or less constant, but the patter of the rain is exactly what it sounds like hitting our patio umbrella...it&#039;s hard to suppress the urge to look out the window (it&#039;s a grey morning here, so that adds to the ambiance)...and the sound of the distant storm in the background is one of my all time favorite hunker down, under a blanket with a bowl of popcorn and a book sounds.
