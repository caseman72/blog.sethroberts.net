		<description><![CDATA[I also found his ebook, &quot;You will not die of a heart attack&quot; interesting reading, although it appears to be just a version of his article that was also linked to here (which you can get for free).  He doesn&#039;t really solve the mystery of what caused this epidemic but does shed a new light on something everyone seems to think they know they cause of.  Also, it isn&#039;t as close to an end as he implies - I know of two men in their 50&#039;s who suffered recent heart attacks, and in neither case was there a clear case of obvious cause.  The doctor&#039;s just shrugged their shoulders or said their must have been an unknown family history when questioned - so frustrating!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t put too much weight on the Clean Air Act.  According to the enviro writer Lomberg, if you plot the decline of dirt in the air in the UK (or maybe England and Wales) there is no change of slope when the Act came into force.  [I have not checked this claim.]

On the other hand, there is no doubt that the air got cleaner and cleaner whatever the actual cause.  And anyway, maybe the slope would have changed for the worse but for the Act.  For example, maybe economics drove industries to replace coal by oil but it needed the Act to force domestic users off coal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry for the double comment, but this paper from BMC Public Health also shows a much less dramatic drop in CHD mortality than Grimes&#039;s paper appears to - in part due to the way the data are presented. For the age groups at the greatest risk of CHD, the decline from 1970 to today is more like 50%, rather than 95% (or a factor of 10).

		<description><![CDATA[Did you happen to ask Grimes about the effect of smoking on CHD? It seems odd that he apparently disregards tobacco use entirely, given that it is known to be a significant risk factor for heart disease, and that tobacco consumption has varied significantly over time. I&#039;m not saying that Vitamin D doesn&#039;t matter, or anything like that, but just that you&#039;d expect to see some discussion of the impact of tobacco.

Here&#039;s a link to some historical stats on UK tobacco consumption, which peaked in 1945:

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, I didn&#039;t ask him. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glancing at the wiki it looks like it has also reversed recently.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Global Dimming, at 4% or less, cannot explain changes by a factor of 10.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is your basis for saying that sunlight has not changed much.  Have you ever heard of those who claim &quot;Global Dimming&quot; has been substantial based on long-running &quot;pan evaporation&quot; experiments?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: My basis is what I have read about global weather during the 20th century. Sunlight changes can&#039;t possibly explain the results Grimes describes (the rise and fall of heart disease by a factor of 10-100, peaking at 1970). I did not know about that Global Dimming stuff, it sounds interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
