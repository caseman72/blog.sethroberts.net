		<description><![CDATA[I take typing tests and have found that &gt;50g of butter a day improves accuracy from around 97-98% to 98-100%, I can type about 87-89 wpm eating anything, but when I consume butter within a few minutes my accuracy and speed jumps miraculously to 90-110 wpm.

I did one week of butter and then a one week washout and then replaced butter with 85% chocolate and the improvements were more substantial than butter, I had never been able to type more than 111 wpm with 100% accuracy, with about 50g of 85% chocolate I typed 117 wpm with 100% accuracy for the first time in my life. 70-75% chocolate was comparable to butter.

The washout period doesn&#039;t seem to matter and butter and chocolate combined don&#039;t seem to have a compound effect, so in myself chocolate confers what butters seems to and then some.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you if any butter is good? I mean, my mother usually buys low cholesterol butter. I still prefer normal butter since as I read from T. Ferriss and others cholesterol is good for Test production. But it would be interesting to know.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I tried several brands and price points. I never saw a difference. For example, I found no difference between Land o&#039;Lakes and Strauss butter.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I suspect you have covered this before but any thoughts on Dave Asprey&#039;s &quot;Bulletproof Coffee&quot; i.e. coffee with grass fed butter + mct oil added. I have been trying it for the last several months. Prior to April of this year, I drank 3 cups of coffee total in the prior 4 decades, but I&#039;m finding I really like this as part of my routine.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t know if mct oil has any effect but butter certainly does. I drink black tea every morning...not so different from coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
