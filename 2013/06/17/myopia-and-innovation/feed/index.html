&lt;strong&gt;Seth: One of the first managing editors of &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; had a saying: &quot;don&#039;t get it right, get it written.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the basis for the whole venture capital industry today, and can be seen in many commerical industries at their infancy.  Examples: automobiles at the start of the 20th century, dot-coms at the very tail end, plus many in between.  Most VC backed companies fail or flounder and only a small few are successful, but when the capital was invested, every company in a VC&#039;s portfolio was forecast to have a chance to be a total success.

This optimism actually creates much consumer surplus, as in the process of innovation, nobody is sure what exactly will fit the consumer need, so proliferation of ideas and oversupply a) helps identify the best idea and b) helps drive down the price quickly so that more people can benefit from the new invention.   Three cheers for myopia!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Your comment reminds me of something I figured out about how to do science: To make progress, it isn&#039;t necessary to have a correct explanation of something. Any explanation is helpful, so long as it is testable, because doing the test will be more enlightening that you realize. (Scientists are too pessimistic, engineers too optimistic.) What&#039;s important is motivation, not understanding.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s a more direct way that evolution favors that optimism bias and amnesia of the negative. Without it there would be hardly any second pregnancies. When I think about it objectively, having children has brought about some of the most grueling hours of my life, with weeks of feeding a newborn round the clock, hours of colicky howling (and that&#039;s after pregnancy and childbirth). But those memories feel remote. The highlights feel much more real. Thank you, dopamine!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That used to be my explanation. I can&#039;t say I have evidence against it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

On the substantial issue, I found Elizer Yudkowsky&#039;s post useful, though too wordy:

		<description><![CDATA[Without having seen the Maryland study, I note that the standard KABC0 injury scale for car crashes has a very broad range for &quot;A,&quot; anything from &quot;taken in, checked, and released&quot; to &quot;permanently paralyzed.&quot;  Police might also code A for cases where someone refused treatment, and comparisons of police and medical reports have shown B injuries that look bad (visible abrasions, any complaint of neck or head trauma) coded as As.

Of course people forget things, but if researches simply compared self-reporting to crash reports, they were conflating two types of error.  As I said, this is without having seen the study, so it might have taken into account reporting problems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you have a cite for the Maryland car accident study?  I study self-report/recall accuracy, and I&#039;ve never heard of it.  I want to add it to my list.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Sorry, I don&#039;t. I learned about it from a talk by Elizabeth Loftus, maybe around 1992. I think the talk is online somewhere.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Indeed, what would humanity be without the optimism bias? Everything we&#039;ve done since deviating from other primates has been kind of insanely optimistic.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Maybe there is a compensating bias in the other direction (pessimism bias) because if you are unrealistically optimistic in life-endangering situations, you may die. If I underestimate how long a project will take, nobody dies. If planners underestimate how much an airport will cost, nobody dies.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
