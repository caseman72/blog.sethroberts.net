		<description><![CDATA[Disgracefully, the Globe and Mail assigned McCloskey to review Bailey&#039;s book. I&#039;m glad he&#039;s managed to continue his career, but if I&#039;m not mistaken, he never wrote his planned book on &quot;autogynephiliac&quot; transsexuals - TMWWBQ focusses on the effeminate type, doesn&#039;t it? If so, that&#039;s a loss, especially with transsexual issues being so much in the news.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: TMWWBQ covers autogynephilic (non-homosexual) transsexuals. I presume that is why Conway and McCloskey hated it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Admit it, Seth, you had &quot;cattiness&quot; in mind.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, the opposite. A puzzle about autogynephilic transsexuals is their hyper-masculine behavior. In various ways (e.g., job choice) they appear more masculine than the average man.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
