		<description><![CDATA[In bands of hunter gathers, there are strong pressures on men to conform to an egalitarian ethos.  Since this is ultimately enforced by violence, a lot of this is weeded out when the state gets a monopoly on violence.

Pressures for women to conform are not generally enforced by violence so they are more likely to stick around/ be rediscovered under civilization.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if it is part of establishing the pecking order. Perhaps men are quicker to threaten or use violence to establish social dominance, and therefore might use size to determine pecking order nonverbally. If women are slower to threaten or use violence, then superiority must be established using other means.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d imagine that it has something to do with sex and mating. The two examples both show women knocking back a rival&#039;s reproductive advantages- one for good looks and the other for extra ornamentation. It&#039;s pretty obvious that women&#039;s looks play a far larger role in finding a mate than mens&#039;. So it makes sense that women would look to hamstring women who have a leg up in that game. It&#039;s the same with women who sleep around, they&#039;re &#039;cheating&#039; and the women will be more viscous than the men policing it.

Men don&#039;t have a great deal of trouble falling in line behind and supporting somebody they genuinely respect- the captain of the football team type doesn&#039;t have a lot of guys gossiping about how he shouldn&#039;t show off his bench press. It&#039;s a cliche but it&#039;s true that the people who &#039;hate the football team&#039; are the ones dressed in black and smoking behind the library. The other socially dominate types are mostly happy to be along for the ride with their leader. There are occasional power struggles, but when they&#039;re over most men are happy to fall into line behind the winner without taking little shots over and over.

It&#039;s all averages with exceptions, but that largely conforms to my experiences. Looking at real life is a lot more interesting than positing how thing ought to be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a theory that women evolved gossip (and cattiness) as a way to connect with each other during those long days at home while the men were out hunting.

As a man, it&#039;s easy to interpret gossipping and cattiness as pressure from other women to conform. That&#039;s a male-brain interpretation and assumption which may not be true. Perhaps women understand that this cattiness is just cultural, just a way to connect, and do not hear the words (from other women) as literal pressure to conform. I.e. they roll with the verbal punches - they don&#039;t take this kind of criticism (from other women) as seriously as a man would.

I am neither a woman nor an evolutionary scholar, but I&#039;ve heard a similar explanations from multiple sources.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A long, long time ago... a woman who was 8 or 9 months pregnant would have had a difficult time surviving on her own.  Not impossible but more difficult.  A 9 month pregnant female can&#039;t run as fast, climb as fast, jump as high and so on.  Chances for survival are enhanced if she is in a community of non-pregnant females and perhaps a few males hanging around because of the sexual availability of the non-pregnant females.   If that is the case, then conforming is the most rational strategy - being non-conforming risks ouster.  Being non-conforming is an implicit, and sometimes explicit, judgement against the group]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do think that there is some gender bias in the assumption that men don&#039;t do this.  I am a psychologist and have treated way too many men who were bullied as adolescents because they didn&#039;t conform.  They were dumped in trashcans, locked in lockers, and beaten up.  Gay men are often beaten to death for their differences.

That being said, I do wonder with females if there is some evolutionary pressure to conform so as not to attract attention to the female group in general.  Someone who stands out as a female may attract dangerous attention to the female &quot;tribe.&quot;  There may be other competition pressures as well (the female who stands out may attract the alpha ape.  Anyhoo, it is all theorizing, but the idea that only females do this too each other is plain wrong.

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a relevant study... http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2013/02/22/conflict-at-the-office-women-and-the-catty-trap/

&quot;The subjects, both male and female, consistently viewed the conflict between the two women in the most negative light.&quot;

If men are being critical, then they are blunt and honest, if women are critical, then they are catty or b*tchy.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Well, yes, since there is no male equivalent of &quot;catty&quot; when men criticize other men it follows that different words would be used to describe that criticism. I don&#039;t see how that sheds light on whether there is a male/female difference here.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

<p>&#8220;The subjects, both male and female, consistently viewed the conflict between the two women in the most negative light.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps it&#039;s more a difference between males and females in how non-conformity is punished and what sort of things are punished. As an example,   any queer person will tell you there is pressure to conform from both males and females, but you get threats of violence, actual violence, &quot;corrective rape&quot;, and  sometimes even murder, from men. The comedian Louis CK has a joke about this difference of physical vs emotional violence between men and women; &#039;a man will cut off your arm, but a woman will s*** in your heart&#039;. 
Of course, you also have &quot;gas lighting&quot; (using lies to make a woman doubt her memory,/perception/sanity), but that&#039;s not male on male abuse. I think there is more pressure on women to conform from both men and women.

&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: &quot;More pressure on women to conform from both men and women&quot;. That would be a good study. For example, if someone wears an unusual colored shirt, is there a difference in response depending on whether the wearer is male or female?&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>
