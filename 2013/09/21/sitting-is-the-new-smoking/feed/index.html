		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

One of my favorite books is Pete Egoscue&#039;s &quot;Health through Motion&quot;, linking posture and health.  Sitting is bad, but even when people move, they&#039;re repetitively using the same muscles over and over.  They don&#039;t get the variety of movement needed to maintain the entire muscular system.  The result is some muscles go dormant, while others do extra work they weren&#039;t designed to do to pick up the slack. These muscle imbalances shift the skeletal system out of alignment, posture deteriorates, and overall health declines.  The book teaches how to analyze posture, and how to re-engage dormant muscles.

Egoscue also fits into your theme of outsiders vs experts.  He&#039;s contended that some things like cartilage loss can be stopped and repaired naturally once the muscular system is rebalanced (http://bepainfreeforlife.com/2010/01/26/the-body-is-amazing/).  Even things like digestion and sleep improve when posture is improved.]]></description>
