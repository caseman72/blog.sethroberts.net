		<description><![CDATA[They&#039;re not all that similar. Chinese dragons are essentially flying snakes, whereas western dragons have four legs, large wings, and torsos. All they have in common are flying, being reptilian and breathing fire. (Actually, do Chinese dragons do that?)

Note also that Chinese &quot;lions&quot; are not all that similar to real lions, and in Japanese the real giraffe is named after a very different mythological creature, the kirin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is just an artifact of language, and how somebody a long time ago decided that the proper translation of &quot;Qilin&quot; is &quot;Dragon&quot;. They could have easily decided to simply call it a &quot;Qilin&quot;. 

This is similar to how the word &quot;Typhoon&quot; just means &quot;Hurricane in the Pacific&quot;. (or more precisely, &quot;tropical cyclone&quot;. 

I bet that whatever similarity there is between the two imaginary animals is a recent development: before East-West contact, they could have been totally different long ago.]]></description>
