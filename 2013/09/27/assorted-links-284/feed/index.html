		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Watching this video makes me think flavor scientists have reverse-engineered the SLD to create the Doritos Locos Taco for Taco Bell. 

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/dining/the-nacho-dorito.html

There is a reference to an effort to avoid adding a specific flavor to trigger satiety, and an attempt to prolong the odor so that more hunger is triggered. 

It almost makes you think these scientists know exactly how to thwart efforts at appetite control.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I think I cured my tinnitus with the low carb, high fat diet that I used to fix type 2 diabetes. My ears used to ring fairly loudly, especially at night and sometimes also had a low frequency throbbing in my right ear. The right ear problem is gone and I now go for days without hearing any higher frequency ringing. I knew from random blog reading that LCHF works for lots of people on diabetes but I haven&#039;t seen anything on tinnitus.  It probably took 3-6 months before I realized this helped and it could be that I was still tweaking my diet and something specific did it. For example I got more careful about lowering omega-6 fats which I&#039;ve read is related to inflammation levels. In any event, it&#039;s interesting that a generally irreversible, serious condition is fixed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I manage my tinnitus (right ear) by running my attention down a muscle on the right side of my neck for a few minutes. Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t work if I try to notice the moment when the tinnitus disappears, but there&#039;s a reliable corelation between doing the relaxation technique and the tinnitus going away for weeks or months.

Being able to manage something that&#039;s supposed to be incurable contributes to my cynicism about medicine-- this doesn&#039;t mean I think all tinnitus has the same cause or the same cure.

I don&#039;t have a history of exposure to loud sounds, for example. My tinnitus seems to be correlated with worrying about money.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding tinnitus, my husband recently gave up taking statin drugs, one reason was because they gave him tinnitus - which would start after he took a dose and gradually fade (he was taking a dose every other day before he gave it up completely).  It was only one of many side effects that bothered him but one I had never heard of before.  And this was on a fairly low dose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I wonder if you have an opinion on Dr. John Sarno and his theory of Tension Myoneural Syndrome (TMS, the idea that much physical pain, especially back and neck pain, is caused by a mindbody disorder whereby the mind represses unconscious rage by creating a physical distraction through the autimmune system via reducing the flow of blood to certain muscles).  The reason I mention it is that he surmises that tinnitus could also be a similar mindbody disorder, controllable (like TMS) through a process of becoming aware of the rage-oriented contents of the unconscious. I had considerable success in eliminating back, neck and wrist pain through application of his methods. Though I did not set out to eliminate my tinnitus through his method, the tinnitus (years long and very annoying) totally went away around the same time. Regards,]]></description>
