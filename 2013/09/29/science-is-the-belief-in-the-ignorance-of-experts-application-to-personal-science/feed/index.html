		<description><![CDATA[I think Feynman just fundamentally did not trust experts, authority, teachers, other scientists, etc. He was an extreme case. On his chalkboard at the time of his death he had written &quot;What I cannot create I do not understand&quot; and &quot;Know how to solve every problem that has been solved&quot;. He felt the need to derive everything for himself. Heck, he didn&#039;t even trusts dentists. He thought brushing your teeth was superstition.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yet he bought meat from meat experts, clothes from clothes experts, electricity from electricity experts, and so on. He flew on planes flown by flying experts. He trusted them with his money and safety. I suppose if I had said this to him he would have said something like &quot;expertise expands to fill areas of ignorance.&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
