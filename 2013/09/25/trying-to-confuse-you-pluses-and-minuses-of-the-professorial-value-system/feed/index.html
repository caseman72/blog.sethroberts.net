		<description><![CDATA[@ Alex.

I recall reading a passage in Jacques Lacan - he wrote something like: &quot;I am deliberately making this hard to follow because otherwise it would not be worth writing&quot;.

Years ago, never been able to track it down with google.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: yeah, that&#039;s a nice summing up. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See also, &quot;Postmodernism Disrobed&quot;, by Richard Dawkins.  Here&#039;s a sample:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose you are an intellectual impostor with nothing to say, but with strong ambitions to succeed in academic life, collect a coterie of reverent disciples and have students around the world anoint your pages with respectful yellow highlighter. What kind of literary style would you cultivate? Not a lucid one, surely, for clarity would expose your lack of content. The chances are that you would produce something like the following:

&quot;We can clearly see that there is no bi-univocal correspondence between linear signifying links or archi-writing, depending on the author, and this multireferential, multi-dimensional machinic catalysis. The symmetry of scale, the transversality, the pathic non-discursive character of their expansion: all these dimensions remove us from the logic of the excluded middle and reinforce us in our dismissal of the ontological binarism we criticised previously.&quot;
