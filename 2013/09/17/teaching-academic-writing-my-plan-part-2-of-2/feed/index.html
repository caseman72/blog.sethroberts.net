		<description><![CDATA[That sounds great. I&#039;d enjoy taking your class. Two thoughts I had reading this...

1. This sounds like a difficult course to teach well. (Much more difficult than a straight-up lecture/assignment class.)

2. &quot;If a student doesn’t pay attention in class — the presentations when other students tell what I told them — he risks having me make the same comment on his writing I made earlier on someone else’s. Then he would have to tell other students that I made that same comment. The other students wouldn’t like that; it wastes their time. So there is pressure to pay attention.&quot;

Consider it a hunch, but this will happen. Probably more than once. And it&#039;s probably not a bad thing, either. If it happens, it probably means that you&#039;re dealing with something that&#039;s difficult for your students. In that case, it won&#039;t be wasting everyone&#039;s time!

Anyway, I look forward to hearing about how the course plays out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just curious if the administration at Tsinghua University gives you freedom to teach your classes in whatever way you see fit, and how that level of freedom compares to American universities.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: so far so good at Tsinghua...At Berkeley, professors complained that I gave students too much freedom.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, This is really awesome.  I hope it works out and can&#039;t wait to hear how it works out.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, Mark. I really have no idea what will happen.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
