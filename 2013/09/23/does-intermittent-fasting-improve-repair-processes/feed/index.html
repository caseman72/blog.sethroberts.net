Blood sugar goes down when fasting to 80 or so. Fasting probably produces dozens of changes. Maybe even hundreds of changes.]]></description>

Also, if fasting reduces aspects of blood sugar, and warts are caused by a virus, maybe the virus needs sugar (in some form) which plummets in the system when fasting and without enough it dies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was given a different method for getting rid of warts - plantar and on my hand. Cover the wart with a bit of banana skin - soft side inside. tape in place for a few hours. After about 24 hours, the centre of the wart dies and goes black. Wash/ scrub this off. If necessary repeat. Usually 2 treatments clears them, and only once have I had to do 3 - that was a very deep wart. I have got rid of several, on several different occasions. Somebody said what do you do with the banana? Might as well eat it!

I think this must be a chemical reaction affecting the wart.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: that&#039;s fascinating. I wonder how it was discovered.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi Seth, speaking of fast, any updates on your ADF routine?  Still a success?  Glycated hemoglobin trending down or has that stabilized at pre-fasting levels?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m in China now where it is hard for me to get HbA1c measurements I trust. It is still a success in other ways: easy, losing weight, saving time. The discipline it requires -- not much, but some -- is somehow pleasant, like physical exercise.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
