		<description><![CDATA[oops, I apologize but I actually only read before the fold when i posted then read the rest.... however, the argument only gets stronger relying only on your own writing after the fold. No one is arguing about the fact that the heart is the thing the pumps blood through the circulatory system, but as you rightly point out, we have only the weakest claims to understand what &#039;the prefrontal cortex&#039; or any other region is doing.

Also, if your main point of the piece is that the Nobel prize in medicine doesn&#039;t strongly effect day-to-day life, you are so wrong you should rethink everything you know. The last three prizes have been handed out for: stem cells, understanding the immune system, and in-vitro fertilization. All fields that are having concrete effects today for real people. 2 years before Kandel, the award was given for nitric oxide; knowledge which is now used routinely in heart surgery and to help keep patients alive after a heart attack. So, when you say &quot;Year after year, the prize-winning work has failed to reduce heart disease&quot; what exactly do you think you mean?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not to promote Kandel, but there is still a large difference in our understanding of the relevant problems. Given a single person we can still say &#039;you have heart dissease, that means you have plaque in location A and it means that if left untreated that you will have an X% chance of undergoing a heart attack, however if we treat it with drug B, you have a Y(&gt;10)% chance of success&#039;. We can&#039;t do anything quite like that for psychological diseases. It is all &#039;do you meet 3 of the 5 criteria&#039;, with very poorly understood mechanism, and very low success rates of treatment.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The cause of heart disease is very poorly understood. Kandel may think it is due to cholesterol.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Actually, our understanding of liver and heart disorders is close to zero, matching our understanding of psychiatric disorders. If we had some understanding of heart disease, for example, we would know why heart disease is much rarer in Japan than in the United States.&quot;

Close to zero? Really? Do you not think you might be overstating, just a little? What would you say constituted 2% understanding? Or 5% understanding?

More relevant, 

&quot;Third, psychotherapy is a biological treatment, a brain therapy. It produces lasting, detectable physical changes in our brain, much as learning does.&quot;...

As I said, it wasn&#039;t measured after treatment, so the study could not provide evidence that psychotherapy changed the brain

Writing this sentence has changed my brain. 

The only interesting claim is  &quot;we can identify specific, measurable markers of a mental disorder, and those biomarkers can predict the outcome of two different treatments: psychotherapy and medication&quot; but I agree the evidence doesn&#039;t support it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind&quot;  is a more demanding requirement than &quot;might some day, if the wind is set fair, conceivably contribute to some invention or discovery that perhaps does benefit mankind&quot;.
