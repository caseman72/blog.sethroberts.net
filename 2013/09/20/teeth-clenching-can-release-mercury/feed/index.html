One of the best is the Huggins Protocol and is based on the pioneering work of Hal Huggins, DDS, MS,  a leading figure in the world of biological, or holistic, dentistry.

		<description><![CDATA[Here is some scientific research. 

For example, a peer-review study published in 2005 by the Freiburg University Institute for Environmental Medicine found that 

“mercury from dental amalgam may lead to nephrotoxicity [kidney poisoning], neurobehavioural changes, autoimmunity [autoimmune disease], oxidative stress, autism, skin and mucosa alterations or non-specific symptoms and complaints,”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice article.  We all know Mercury is a dangerous b/c it is a neurotoxic. What you may not know is that it is lipophilic so it stores likes to store itself in fat stores. Since the human brain has a lot of fat the Hg can go there.

&quot;Silver dental fillings&quot; contain up to 50% Hg. Of course this does not affect everyone as we all have different toxic sensitivities. This is also influenced by your total toxic load

 This is a treatment that dates back to around the time of the US Civil War.

Dentist I know, tell me the fear among the ADA seems to be big lawsuits like Tobacco &amp; Asbestos IF the truth came out]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At least according to Joseph Mercola articles sympathic to &quot;biological dentistry&quot; or &quot;holistic dentistry&quot;, removing mercury amalgam fillings has its own set of dangers (release of large amounts of mercury into the body all at once)! In addition to monitoring one&#039;s symptoms of merrcury poisoning (a la Seth), I wonder if there is a way to also monitor the extent of the increase or decrease of mercury in the body after removing the filling. Scary....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jay S. Cohen wrote an interesting book called, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Over-Dose-Jay-S-Cohen/dp/158542370X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Overdosed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  He makes the point that there is a large amount of variability in how individuals respond to drugs.  Pharmaceutical companies don&#039;t want to admit that this variability exists -- because, at the very least, it complicates dosing issues.  Cohen advocates &quot;start low, go slow&quot; when starting a drug regimen.  (I think the book is out of print now, but used copies are still available.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad to see you take Goldacre to task on this, I completely agree.  I remember when I was reading Bad Science that there was this footnote acknowledging that, in truth, no drugs could ever be determined to be safe for everybody but that one would essentially be wasting their time worrying about that (or something to that effect).  I remember being like &quot;What?!?&quot;, and quickly jotting a note in the margin.  The fact that randomized trials cannot actually &quot;demonstrate&quot; any drug to be safe is missed by most (it&#039;s statistically and logically impossible to show that something is no different than placebo, which is essentially what &quot;demonstrated to be safe&quot; means).]]></description>
