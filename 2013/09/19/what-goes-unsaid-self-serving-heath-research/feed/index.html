		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, sorry I left that part out. 

From:

http://www.jewishgenetics.org/?q=content/ashkenazi-jews-and-brca1-and-brca2

&quot;Various studies have examined the ethnic distribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations associated with breast and ovarian cancer. Three mutations in these genes (185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1 and 6174delT in BRCA2) occur at an increased incidence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, estimated at 2.5% (or 1 in 40), compared to less than 1% in the general population.&quot;

As for the number of Jews, the 5 million number may seem low, but I don&#039;t think that number includes the population who may be descendants of Jews (and thus more likely to carry at least part of the genetic profile associated with the cultural group) yet not qualify as technically &quot;Jewish&quot;. I count myself as part of this group.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jay, there are about 5 million Jews in the US out of a total population of about 300 million-- I don&#039;t think that&#039;s enough to affect the breast cancer stats much.

Here&#039;s a weird one: cancer rates are *positively* corelated with income. http://www.who.int/gho/ncd/mortality_morbidity/cancer_text/en/

More longevity? More diagnosis? Something quite mysterious?

Map of states:

http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/statistics/state.htm

Unfortunately, most maps are by country-- this strikes me as fairly useless.

Seth, what do you do to avoid pollutants in China?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

I think a big part of the incidence of Breast Cancer might have something to do with the populations of individuals who carry harmful mutations of BCRA1 &amp; 2, in particular, Ashkenazi Jews.

From the cancer.gov web site:

1. How much does having a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation increase a woman’s risk of breast and ovarian cancer?

A woman’s lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Breast cancer: About 12 percent of women in the general population will develop breast cancer sometime during their lives (4). By contrast, according to the most recent estimates, 55 to 65 percent of women who inherit a harmful BRCA1 mutation and around 45 percent of women who inherit a harmful BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70 years (5, 6).

2. Are mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 more common in certain racial/ethnic populations than others?

Yes. People of Ashkenazi Jewish descent have a higher prevalence of harmful BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations than people in the general population. Other ethnic and geographic populations around the world, such as the Norwegian, Dutch, and Icelandic peoples, also have higher prevalences of specific harmful BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The United States has the highest breast cancer incidence (age-adjusted) rates in the world — about 120 per 100,000 women, in contrast to 20-30 per 100,000 women in poor countries&quot;: seek and ye shall find.  Screening is bound to put up the number of cases diagnosed, isn&#039;t it?  It may extend nary a life, but at least it&#039;ll find tumours, however small or slow-growing.

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, one of the reasons that &quot;lifestyle modification&quot; has gotten a bad rap over the last fifty years is that so much of the advice was either oversimplified or just flat-out wrong. In fact, one could make the argument that smoking is almost the only thing that the &quot;public Health&quot; community has gotten right in the last fifty years - that&#039;s an exaggeration, but not much of one. So naturally, people are a bit skeptical that this time, the authorities finally have it right. And God forbid that that advice might offend someone&#039;s ideological prejudices, as seen above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What Alex said but even more so because it&#039;s a women&#039;s cancer and women react angrily and emotionally to the idea that anything is their fault.

Pop culture example from an episode of Sex and the City:

Samantha: I don&#039;t understand how this happened to me.
Dr: It could be genetics, but since there&#039;s no breast cancer in your family, it could be a variety of factors,
- diet, lifestyle choices.
Samantha: - Lifestyle choices?
Dr: Some studies have shown women who haven&#039;t had children
have an increased chance of getting it.
Samantha: I see.
So I brought this on myself?
Dr: No, I&#039;m just giving you the basic...
Samantha: I think we&#039;re done here.
Dr: Maybe I wasn&#039;t clear.
Samantha: Give me my chart. I&#039;m going to find some woman doctor, some hot woman doctor who understands what this is all about.


Yes, it&#039;s fiction but it&#039;s popular fiction and this is not the only place where you&#039;ll hear that same attitude.

A cure fits much better into the mental model of the world that women tend towards - if something is wrong it&#039;s someone else&#039;s job to figure out how to fix it.]]></description>
