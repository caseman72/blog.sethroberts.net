		<description><![CDATA[Filling out short mood surveys is pretty common when using CBT in the NHS in the UK, and I&#039;m assuming pretty much anywhere that funders want to see effectiveness data (e.g. 42nd Street in Manchester near where I live which is a charity providing free counselling for young people).  My experience of private therapists/counsellors is that they tend not to, though.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Are the mood surveys daily? Or just when you come to offices for therapy? My guess is the latter.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s another interesting article about psychotherapy.  Science writer John Horgan discusses the &quot;Dodo Effect&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Dodo&quot; refers to an episode in Lewis Carroll’s fable &lt;i&gt;Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt; in which Alice and other characters wash up onto an island. There they encounter a dodo bird who persuades them to race around the island. The dodo finally announces that the race is over and proclaims, &quot;Everyone has won, and all must have prizes!&quot;

Over the last few decades, the psychologist Lester Luborsky of the University of Pennsylvania tested the dodo effect by comparing different psychotherapies, including psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy. His research confirmed that all methods are equally helpful to patients. [...]

Other prominent researchers—notably Jerome Frank, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins—realized that the dodo effect undermined the validity of all psychotherapies. Frank’s own research corroborated the dodo effect. In one study, he and colleagues provided depressed patients with three treatments: weekly individual therapy, weekly group therapy and minimal individual therapy, which consisted of just one half-hour session every two weeks. &quot;To our astonishment and chagrin, patients in all three conditions showed the same average relief of symptoms,&quot; Frank wrote...
