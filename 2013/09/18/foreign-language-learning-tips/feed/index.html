		<description><![CDATA[Great post, with good practical ideas! I especially like the suggestion of reading aloud. I read aloud in French every day. But I&#039;m not at all a beginner, I read aloud as a preparation for speaking (just as Jan Rendek says). One of my best reading experiences was reading a long bed-time story in French to a four-year- old French girl who kept asking questions and making comments. I noticed the next day my French came more easily than usual. I&#039;ve started a new language, and also found - like Robbo - that I seem to hit a plateau for quite a while, and then suddenly, I make a leap ahead. It must be the way our brain processes language.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a translator/interpreter for Slovak-English living in a non-English speaking country so I&#039;m not speaking English very often.
But to be a good interpreter, one has to speak English often.

I noticed that I have a warm-up period of app. 10-20 minutes into the job. So next time, I just read an English text for 1/2 hour before a job and voila, the warm-up period was zero :-)

I&#039;m also reading English texts aloud whenever possible. Did not hurt so far :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anki is one easy way to track your language progess. I have 1539 mature cards in my most recent Mandarin Chinese deck, which means I&#039;ve probably memorized something like 500 new vocabulary words in the last 7 months.

There are some free sites out there that will estimate your vocabulary by having you read an article in the target language &amp; mark the words you don&#039;t recognize.

For listening &amp; speaking, you&#039;ll probably need a partner of some sort, although you might be able to record yourself &amp; compare it to previous recordings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the spirit of &#039;Quantified Self&#039;,  how does one measure ones own progress in learning a language ? 

Subjectively I feel I stay still for a while, then something happens that makes me aware that I now am significantly improved from x weeks previously, although in between there was no sensation of daily progress.

With a yardstick of some kind, even very imprecise, it would be possible to test different tactics and find out what worked best. Without one, it&#039;s a matter of guesswork and subjectivity.

Any ideas ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I agree that Heisig in isolation may not be effective because it&#039;s not inherently interesting. I use kanji.koohii.com to study Heisig; it uses online flashcards (you can set up an account for free) which makes Heisig into something more like an interactive video game. (You can share and vote on the memorization tricks everyone has created. I also add the pronunciations to the electronic flash cards, creating deeper &quot;islands of solid comprehension.&quot;) Matching what you suggested, I read a lot of manga [only titles I enjoy] and this is my reward for learning all the Heisig kanji.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am about 30 months into studying Swedish. At the same time I have been doing some freelance teaching of English, so I have experienced both sides of the desk. I endorse your friend&#039;s point about reading aloud. Some of the most productive classroom time I have spent has been students reading aloud and the teacher helping them improve their accent (consonants, vowels, stress, and tone). 

I try to read something every day in &#039;study mode&#039;, which means use an online dictionary to look up words and expressions I don&#039;t understand, and a notebook to write down those I think may be useful. Just the act of writing them down helps them to stick in the mind. I started off using &#039;easy-read&#039; materials prepared specially for learners, now I use &#039;good&#039; authors - not excessively literary but writers of clear and expressive Swedish.

I also try to write a little Swedish every day (I have a Swedish blog for this). Writing, to me, is a good way to build the active vocabulary and stock of expressions you need to exercise the highest skill, which in my view is to talk fluently, expressively, and correctly in back-and-forth conversation. 

Where a blog scores over class exercises is that it is my choice what I write and how and when I write it. Of course choosing my own subjects means I am interested and want to do them justice. To do this I have to learn new words and expressions, and by using them they become part of my active vocabulary.

I am looking to engage someone to help me by listening to me read aloud and correcting my accent, and reading my blog and correcting my grammatical and word-selection errors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I feel like I need different levels of difficulty depending on my energy level. If I&#039;m highly motivated, I&#039;ll try to have a conversation with a Chinese coworker. If I&#039;m less motivated, maybe something passive like watching Chinese TV. If I&#039;m tired, sometimes even passive sources are frustrating because they&#039;re too fast &amp; my comprehension is low. At these times, something even more passive, like watching an English TV show with Chinese subtitles &amp; my finger on the pause button works really well. This way I&#039;m not lost as far as what is going on in the show, but I&#039;m still exposed to Chinese &amp; picking up new vocab words.]]></description>

My experience exactly. Of course, with all these isolated areas of comprehension, I would often steer the conversation to a place where I could use them! May have made people think I was a bit OCD at the time.

		<description><![CDATA[Many good ideas in there!  Including bjk&#039;s.

I think that the Heisig method (either the &quot;Remembering the Kanji&quot; book for Japanese or &quot;Remembering the Hanzi&quot; book for Mandarin) does just what he discusses - it might be the ultimate way to systematically employ mnemonic tricks to memorize the meaning of 2000+ characters in a short period of time.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: The Heisig method is good, I agree. But in isolation, I have found, it is worthless. For me, at least, it has to be connected with something more social or pleasant -- something motivational.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I second the recommendation about songs. A sappy love song usually has easy-to-understand lyrics and phrases that are useful even if you&#039;re not in love.  (e.g. &quot;if you don&#039;t love me, then X&quot;  is easy to replace with a different verbs).  It helps that the catchiness of a pop beat is a good way to pass time on mundane tasks (e.g. commuting or exercising).

Two that I like for Chinese are 全是爱 (or anything from 凤凰传奇）and 天下无敌。 (google for the lyrics, or ask any of your students to set you up with QQ Music so you can listen as much as you like).]]></description>
