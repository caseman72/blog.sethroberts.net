		<description><![CDATA[People&#039;s experiences with magnesium seem to vary. Some claim it helps them sleep, others say it keeps them up.

When I first used magnesium (200mg/d), on day four I slept longer/deeper than I had in years. But the effect wore off and my sleep returned to &quot;baseline&quot;. I tried increasing the dose (400mg/d), but it made my sleep worse. At 400mg/d I also developed diarrhea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Maybe magnesium will improve my sleep. That should be easy to test.

I look forward to the analysis. As it happens, I&#039;ve already started randomized &amp; blinded consumption of 800mg magnesium citrate, and sleep will be one of the endpoints.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FYI: One common treatment for hemmorrhoids is to take a bath in epsom salt water; epsom salts are high in magnesium...

I&#039;ve twice now floated in a sensory deprivation room in 10 inches of water saturated with epsom salts -- I wonder how much the calming exuberance I and others feel during and afterwards is tied to the absorption of magnesium...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, isn&#039;t your sleep quality already at 99+/100? How will you detect any additional improvement?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: When I wake up I rate how rested I feel on a scale from 0 to 100%. On this scale, the difference between 99% and 100% is easy to notice -- even though it may not seem like much. I think what I am rating is how much remains of something, where 100% = none. Maybe it is easier to see why 1% and 0% can be easy to distinguish.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
