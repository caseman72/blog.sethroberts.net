		<description><![CDATA[The history of pharmaceutical drugs says yes, this is a possibility. Many drugs with short-term benefits have turned out to have long-term costs that weren&#039;t made clear. Likewise, the bias of &quot;evidence-based medicine&quot; (which pays great attention to the benefits of treatments, and almost no attention to their costs) also suggests this is a serious problem with professional medical research. When you study yourself, I think there is less bias and better monitoring. You can detect bad effects sooner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: I certainly agree with what you have written, but one thing that concerns me is whether our short term successes could be deceptive. For example, could the ingestion of significant amounts of say butter cause long term health issues that would only be discovered when it is too late. Or could taking a certain nutritional, have short term benefits and longer term consequences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Empowering personal scientists would also probaby be far faster and efficient than haranguing kids to go into science majors (which might result in more cheap lab techs and teaching assistants in ten or fifteen years, but not necessarily more breakthrough discoveries.)

One thing might help propel personal science is a series of contests, at about 1/100th the scale (or less) of the SpaceX prize. 

Contests might recognize things like the annual best breakthrough in...
- micro power production
- fermented food production
- bee keeping 
- backyard mulching
- gray water repurposing/usage
- low-water landscaping
- inexpensive micro-apartment design
- inexpensive, supportive senior living design
- safer/easier/more effective/higher compliance exercise methodologies to preserve muscle mass in seniors

...etc.

The prizes would probably not even need to be financial to be effective. 

And I can&#039;t think of a better coordinating point than The Journal of Personal Science (nor a better coordinator than you, Seth.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking that publication schedules for news and magazines have a similar ill effect to what you describe for science.

If you have to keep filling a certain amount of space or time with &quot;information&quot;, you&#039;re going to be either puffing up small amounts of information or missing important stuff, probably both.

Admittedly, since resources are limited, missing important things is inevitable, but having to puff up relatively minor things wastes resources.]]></description>
