		<description><![CDATA[I go to a lot of loud concerts and have tinnitus.  Doctors warn people about loud noise all the time.  

There seems to be a psychological component to people who are disturbed by ear disorders.  The more you focus on the problem, the bigger the problem becomes.  This habituation therapy seems to work for hyperacusis as well:

		<description><![CDATA[I have for a long time been sensitive to loud sound. In the 80&#039;s I walked out of a Billy Idol concert because it was killing my ears. I often ask coffee shops and restaurants to reduce the volume, and although they don&#039;t like it and friends are sometimes embarrassed I do not feel guilty at all.
One friend wore cotton in his ears for many years and I have taken up the practice. He is a musician and so am I, so to reduce stress and keep good pitch, I took up his practice.  Be prepared for people asking you if there is something is wrong with your ears. Take care of yourself, don&#039;t be afraid to ask for what you want. Think outside the box!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Exhibit 1 in the argument that doctors hurt you is tonsillectomies, probably the most common operation ever.&quot;

How about circumcision? I&#039;m talking about routine infant circumcision (currently performed mostly on unconsenting newborn males in the US). Is that not far more common than tonsillectomy? Does it not cause far greater harm?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, it is far more common. &quot;Does it not cause far greater harm?&quot; That&#039;s not clear at all. Why do you think this?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another thanks to Ross for the tip.

I offer two recent and relevant stories.  

Recently my wife and I flew to California on a Saturday, leaving at 11:50 AM.  Apparently most Midwestern vacationers start drinking before a noon flight and continue drinking during the flight.  The volume in the plane rose higher and higher as the drunks yelled at each other and four babies cried.  I finally tore pieces of paper napkin and stuffed the wads in my ears.

The other story happened at my physician&#039;s office several weeks ago.  I had gone in for a yearly physical.  They do the paperwork thing and then have you wait outside the doctor&#039;s office.  Unfortunately for me, a 60 inch TV screen mounted above the admissions window blared the sound to some reality TV show about building gignormous back yard decks.  The sound drove me further and further away, until I was standing in the hall and peeking around the corner as I waited for the nurse come retrieve me.

It&#039;s not that I dislike loud music.  My favorite band for years was Sonic Youth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s odd to me is that I know a fair number of people who are in their 40s and 50s and who have attended lots of loud rock concerts over the years, and continue to do so.  I have not noticed any hearing loss in them.

I&#039;m also mystified by stories such as this one:

http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=2768201f-b809-4b9a-bdd6-a091929e7149&amp;p=2

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The festival&#039;s loudest performance came during KISS -- the band apparently hit a high of 136 dB before an NCC official insisted that the sound engineer turn it down. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That performance by KISS is rumored to be one of the loudest, ever.  I wonder how the concert-goers (especially the ones right near the stage) escaped serious, permanent damage to their hearing.]]></description>
