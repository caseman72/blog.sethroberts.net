		<description><![CDATA[have you tried making kefir Seth?  ridiculously easy with much more probiotics than yogurt.  also easy to store/put to sleep.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I have made kefir. It was not ridiculously easy, although maybe I was doing something wrong. Do I need kefir grains? I don&#039;t know. Do you use kefir grains? If so where did you get them?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A fascinating example of bacterial interactions within humans is something I was reading earlier about studies from the early 20th century about tuberculosis and  its possible anti-tumor effects.

This led to the novel but effective idea of using the BCG vaccine to treat bladder cancer.
