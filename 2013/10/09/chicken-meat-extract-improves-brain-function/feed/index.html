		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Your beloved needs to start a food blog.&quot;  As a birthday present I plan to sign her up for a course on smoking food, held amongst the beauties of the Lake District.   Amn&#039;t I good to her?

On a marginally more serious note, how about duck eggs, Seth?

		<description><![CDATA[If they really had something they would use a large sample, let independent researchers do the study, use an ordinary IQ test and follow up after at least six months or even a year to show that the effect could be permanent. Ergo they have zippo.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: IQ tests are not designed for repeated testing. The stronger the effect, the smaller the sample they would need. My research suggests the improvement lasts about a day. I suspect they don&#039;t know whether their extract works, even though it does.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, on a related subject, have you heard anything from Eri Gentry?  I was hoping that her &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/29/the-buttermind-experiment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Buttermind&lt;/a&gt; experiment would be the first of many such crowd-sourced studies, but the whole thing has apparently petered out.  Seems a shame.  It would be nice to have a group of people who could be called upon to test claims such as the one about the chicken extract.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yeah, I agree. I haven&#039;t heard anything from Eri Gentry lately.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Duck: now you&#039;re talking.  My beloved does a lovely smoked duck salad in the summer, and roast duck in the winter.  Though I see  that we&#039;re going to kick off the roasts season with Guinea Fowl - presumably because there&#039;s still ample tarragon in the garden.  Ah bliss.]]></description>
