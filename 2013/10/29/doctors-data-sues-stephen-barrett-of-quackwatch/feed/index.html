		<description><![CDATA[You are forgetting the difference between reliability, accuracy, and validity. If two tests from the same person yield the same result, then you have a reliable test. But it may not be accurate (the report may have said &quot;12&quot; both times but the true result is &quot;70&quot;) nor valid (it may have said 12 both times, and 12 is correct, but there are 12 ducks and the report said it counted chickens).

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Where am I forgetting the difference between reliability accuracy and validity?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have no dog in Quackwatch v. Doctor&#039;s Data fight, but the Bolen site you linked to seems like a heaping helping of crazy. I clicked on a couple of links covering topics I&#039;m familiar with--not a lot of connection with reality. But if you were wondering whether octagenarian magician and skeptic James Randi might be gay, this is the place to confirm it. A lot.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, Bolen&#039;s ideas are ridiculous and his treatment of Randi is shameful. But he provides useful links to legal documents.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, stephen but what you really want is multiple samples sent to the _same_ laboratory.  That&#039;s why the studies you mention are a whitewash.  But then, you probably don&#039;t care.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two studies have been done in which identical hair samples were sent to multiple laboratories. If you would like copies, e-mail me.

Tim Bolen has very little understanding of what is happening in Doctor&#039;s Data&#039;s suit against me. He often expresses excitement are about things he imagines that happen not to be true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would also be interesting to have them test hair that is new and closest to the scalp, vs hair that has been cut off in a trim.  You&#039;d think the later would have more contaminants from shampoo, etc.

Of course, maybe that is the procedure, I&#039;m only assuming the ends are analyzed based on the comment you made about sending it in at each haircut.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My impression of quack watch is the same.  He seems to take the view that anything outside of &quot;standard practice&quot; is quackery.  It seems as if his website should be very helpful-but it is not.  

I am a clinical pathologist.  On your #3, the lab should be doing calibration studies on any test they report results on.  In my lab, we occasionally get requests for documentation of those studies-which we gladly provide.  Just call them and tell them your concerns, and ask for documentation of their controls and proficiency testing over the past several months.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting use of the hair samples.  At one time, Doctor&#039;s Data had a service where you could get your toenails analyzed via neutron activation analysis (NAA).  The toenails are typically less contaminated by external contamination (i.e. the selenium as active ingredient in dandruff shampoos, dirt under your fingernails from gardening, etc.)

You might inquire to see if they could offer that as an alternative to hair sampling.  There is published literature available on NAA of toe nails and other samples that provides (limited in my opinion) guidelines for certain heavy metals and some correlations to disease (i.e. selenium and prostate cancer).]]></description>
