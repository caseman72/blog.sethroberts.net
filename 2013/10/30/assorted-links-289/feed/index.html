		<description><![CDATA[Why I Jumped Off The Ivory Tower 

What makes me pessimistic about my own university and public universities in the United States in general is that their inability to adapt isn&#039;t due simply to bad leadership or an unfavorable economy. It&#039;s based on structural features that are self-reinforcing. Poor leadership drawn from huge corporations, an incentive structure that favors narrow specialization, and a hostility to potentially disruptive research, all reinforce each other. Those of us whose interests don&#039;t fit into that structure have some difficult decisions to make.
