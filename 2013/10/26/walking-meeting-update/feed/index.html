		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Seems interesting that they did not notice a difference in fatigue.
&gt; Could be the gift of being in one’s early 20s perhaps.

If I understand the situation correctly, then we&#039;re comparing 1 hour and 15 minutes of meetings (Seth) to 15 minutes (student). It seems to me that the shorter duration (i.e. less tiring) could well explain why the students didn&#039;t notice much of a difference between walking and sitting meetings.]]></description>

Also correct me if I&#039;m wrong but they are taking notes, walking and talking. That&#039;s challenging.
