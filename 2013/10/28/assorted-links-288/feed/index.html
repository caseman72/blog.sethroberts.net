		<description><![CDATA[The probiotic studied is very interesting, it is a specific strain of Lactobacillus Reuteri which is apparently being studied and marketed by a Canadian company.  It was recently granted FDA approval to be sold in the US under the product name CardioViva.  (I assume it has already been sold in other countries but I don&#039;t know under what names.) It was shown in two published trials to reduce not only LDL cholesterol but also CRP.  After reading about it I purchased some and decided to do my own experiment to see if it lowers cholesterol. (Mine isn&#039;t particularly high but I&#039;m not doing anything else to try and affect it so thought it would be interesting.)   My husband is also trying it, he hasn&#039;t been able to tolerate statins and should lower his LDL some so we&#039;ll see.]]></description>
