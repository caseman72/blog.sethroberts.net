		<description><![CDATA[I, for one, would love to see a longish post titled something like &quot;What I ate this week.&quot;  to get a better overall idea of what you eat, when and how.

You mention specific topics in the posts, and clarifications in the comments, but it would be great to get a broader overview.

As for swimming type nose clips, I have found them somewhat loose (even when wearing two) but came across a post (somewhere in the forums I think) about using spirometry nose clips which have suited me much better since I switched to them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; I get plenty of smell-free calories from the butter I eat.&quot;
In your book which i have you list Extra light Olive Oil, and Sugar Water,
as smell free calories which works with the SLD Diet,
so butter can be added? then it must be eaten by itself otherwise the attending foods will add smell, what else is smell free? flax seed oil does have some smell,
ground seeds maybe not?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t touched margarine since I moved out of my parent&#039;s house decades ago.  Never understood why people would eat it when they can get butter.

Lots of food can be easily fermented at home, from yogurt to dill pickles.  Even leaving the beans to soak in water overnight causes a bit of fermentation to start, and cuts down on flatulence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yes, flaxseed oil is expensive. And must be kept cold. 

I grind the flaxseeds with a blender. Takes seconds. I store them at room temperature. I eat them with yogurt (without sugar), sweetener, and flavoring.

Flaxseed: 30 g.

Yogurt: yogurt I make myself. No sweetener. More sour than store-bought yogurt. About 3 spoonfuls.

Sweetener: Xylitol, honey, or something else. Recently I&#039;ve been using &quot;Japanese yogurt&quot; (a sweetened store-bought yogurt that seems to be different from other yogurt) and fermented rice, which is sold in Chinese food stores.

Flavoring: a small amount (1 tablespoon?) of wine, whisky, tequila, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Professor Roberts,

I too have been struggling with trying to figure out how to get flaxseed into my diet.  I was buying flaxseed oil,  but it is expensive in the long run and I don&#039;t know how to test if it is rancid since flaxseed oil doesn&#039;t seem to taste so great from any producer.  I bought a Piteba oil extracter, but I have failed to make that system work .  My wife put in the amount of flaxseed needed to give everyone who eats two pieces of sourdough bread the 60 g and it wasn&#039;t very tasty.

Can you enumerate the practical ways you ingest flaxseed?  What is your yogurt/fermented rice recipe?   Do you have any other recipes?

Thanks for your blog.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -

Why do you divide your dose of flaxseeds?  Are you still eating it taste free?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: 60 g was a lot to eat at once. Also divided dosing is likely to produce a steadier supply to the brain. No I don&#039;t eat it nose-clipped. I get plenty of smell-free calories from the butter I eat.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beef Stroganoff: first my wife fries the mushrooms in butter and then takes them out and puts them aside to keep warm. Then she melts more butter in the frying pan and adds the fat and any gristle she&#039;s cut off the meat.  When all that has melded together, in goes the beef.  When that&#039;s ready she adds the warm mushrooms.  Then she deglazes the pan with some brandy and finally she adds the cream. 

She serves on rice, with peas.  We feel no need to add butter to our peas for this meal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dearieme - No we Americans aren&#039;t mysterious - despite being told for decades that cholesterol is bad for us butter is sold in every supermarket (so people do buy and use it!) And most restaurants I frequent put butter on the table these days next to the bread basket and not margarine. The real problem is that most restaurants in the kitchen are using mostly cheap vegetable oils, like soybean oil, as does most processed foods - and I bet if you look around the shelves of supermarkets and restaurant kitchens of Europe and other countries you will see a lot of the same thing.  It&#039;s a cost issue.]]></description>
