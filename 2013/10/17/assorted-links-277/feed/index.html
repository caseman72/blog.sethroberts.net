		<description><![CDATA[An anecdote for WBV: my parents have one of these in their physical therapist/personal training studio. One day my little cousin and aunt visited. My cousin was 4 at the time and has very noticeable ADHD. He was running around like a crazy kid does, plopped down on the machine, my mother turned it on, and he immediately calmed down. It was like a light switch had been turned OFF. He was calm and serene with a pleasant smile on his face. The effect only lasted as long as the machine was vibrating. It was quite remarkable. 

My mother has also used it successfully for a patient with MS that was told by his doctor that he &quot;would never&quot; ride a bike. He rode a bike soon after that.

I think it has demonstrated interesting effects on the brain. Personally, I think it feels fabulous and use it for stretching often.]]></description>
