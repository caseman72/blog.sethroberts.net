		<description><![CDATA[Increased bruising from flaxseeds: I think this is due to an increase in clotting time, a well-known effect of flaxseed oil and perhaps fish oil. Too-long clotting time certainly is dangerous -- the danger is of a stroke. I eat ground flaxseed because it has substantial easy to notice benefits (e.g., pink gums instead of reddish gums). If I were in your position, I would start with a tiny dose and increase it. At the first sign of bruising, I would reduce the dose to a dose that doesn&#039;t cause bruising. I would also try to find out if my clotting time (without flaxseeds) was unusually long.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried eating ground flax seeds regularly on two different occasions. Both time, I ended the experiment because I was getting bruises. I mean that tiny bump in anything gave me a bruise. Carrying a heavy box in my harm gave me bruises on both forearms. I even got bruises I could not explain. It seemed dangerous to continue.

Did anyone else encounter that problem? Does it mean something? Is there a solution?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What percentage of calories per day are you consuming as omega 6?  Omega 3?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Omega-6: Not much. 3%? That&#039;s just a guess. Sometimes I eat nuts. I avoid vegetable oils, nut oils, and so on. Omega-3: 10%? Again, these are just guesses.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth posited a neurological benefit. Nick, you posted a link about its efficacy in providing a cardiovascular benefit. Further, the abstracts for the later studies at your link, e.g. regarding vegan consumption, dealt with quantities of flaxseed that are approximately no more than 1/8 of what Seth consumes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Seems to me what would be clarifying/useful is if you were to try and switch out the flaxseed oil for an equal amount of fish-derived omega 3&#039;s (ie, EPA/DHA from fish oil).

The purpose being that you would then know if it were a general omega 3 dosing effect, or specifically an alpha-linolenic acid effect.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Others have found similar effects using other forms of omega-3.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

Flax is healthy, but I don&#039;t think it can offer the same benefits of fish, contrary to what your anecdote suggests.]]></description>
