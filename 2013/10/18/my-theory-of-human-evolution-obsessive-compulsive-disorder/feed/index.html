		<description><![CDATA[Like Nancy pointed out, OCD is not an addiction. I have subclinical OCD and I&#039;d gladly be rid of it. Lack of anxiety (which is as good as it gets) is not addictive.

If I was to give it an evolutionary explanation I&#039;d say those who worried about having bolted their dwelling properly before going to bed had a slightly higher survival rate than others.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;bolted their dwelling&quot;? Locks were invented recently. OCD takes many forms. In one case, a person with OCD did not feel comfortable unless everything in his house was coated with a fine layer of confectioner&#039;s sugar.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As Joe says - just look at animals when the hormones are pumping!  My interest in this evolutionary aspect of rituals is how it plays into that whole can of worms of people getting obese and then trying to fight their way out of it.  I&#039;ve been teaching a series of mindfulness habits and after having a quick browse through your main article, it occurred to me whether I&#039;m just getting people involved in mindfulness or just giving them another ritual to follow?
Would you see mindfulness types of training as a case of one unhealthy ritual (scoffing too much food or starving and binging) with a slightly more healthy one of being aware of your hunger and nipping it in the bud.  I can see I&#039;m going to have to dig deeper into your work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Humans are not the only animal who perform rituals.&quot;

I agree!  See: MATING rituals, for example.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good point. I should have said humans are the only animals with learned rituals.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now I&#039;m enjoying your linked paper on human evolution and trade/specialization.  But again, you say that only humans do X - this time, trade - and there is evidence that some animals do trade.  E.g.,

http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwexa/news/archive/2009/09_0610-tradingbehavior.html

In general, a lot of people who said that &quot;only humans do x&quot; have found that some animals also do the it, even if in simplified and attenuated form.  That would suggest that the evolution of X would have been easier because there was a pre-existing starting point for evolution to work on.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The link isn&#039;t much support for the idea that animals trade: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Georgia State’s Sarah Brosnan, assistant professor of psychology, and research scientist Michael Beran conducted a study to see if chimpanzees spontaneously bartered foods among each other, using tokens which represented those foods. While results indicated that the animals were cognitively able to understand trade, without enforcement from human experimenters, trade disappeared.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Humans are not the only animal who perform rituals.  My dog will not lie down to sleep without first spinning around 3 times before plopping down into her chosen spot for a snooze.  It&#039;s a consistent behavior she&#039;s exhibited since she was a puppy.  It&#039;s like she&#039;s screwing herself into place to be more snug before nodding off.

I once had a cat who had a very set routine for cleaning herself.  She ALWAYS cleaned her entire right arm before licking anything else.  Always.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Okay, let me restrict the term &quot;ritual&quot; to stuff that is transmitted from one person/animal to another.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe &quot;superstitious behavior&quot; is too different from your definition of &quot;ritual&quot;, but here goes anyway. 
I&#039;ve heard of experiments with birds in which they would be rewarded randomly at various rates. If you do it too often or too rarely, they don&#039;t change their behavior. But if it&#039;s around 1/4 of the time, then they start to guess &quot;something I did got me a reward&quot;, and they train themselves to do weird things (which, of course, get them the reward 1/4 of the time), such as stand on one leg.
The punchline is that baseball players hit the ball about 1/4 of the time.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: B. F. Skinner wrote a paper about &quot;superstition&quot; in pigeons that was later shown to be all wrong (by &lt;a href=&quot;http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LF07000001.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Staddon and Simmelhag&lt;/a&gt;). The 1/4 stuff I&#039;ve never heard before and animal learning is my professional field.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
