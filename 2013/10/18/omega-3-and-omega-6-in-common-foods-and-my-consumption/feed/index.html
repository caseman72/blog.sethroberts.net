		<description><![CDATA[To be slightly more explicit, the other day, in a post, you said this:

&quot;As this article recommends, I used to eat plenty of fish. But I still noticed a dramatic improvement in my balance and cognitive abilities when I started taking flaxseed oil. The best amount seemed to be 2-3 tablespoons/day. Fish wasn’t supplying close to the optimum amount of omega-3.&quot;

So you point out that, through self-experimentation, you&#039;ve found that taking a titanic amount of ground flax meal (&quot;the biggest consumer in China.&quot;) produces good results.  So in your experiments you kept increasing flax O3 dosing until it produced efficacious results.  Did you attempt a similar thing with fish oil, only to find there was no effective dosage that could do for you what flax oil did?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, I haven&#039;t tried fish oil extensively. When I first started talking about the benefits of flaxseed oil on mental tasks, others tried fish oil and found similar results. No doubt fish oil works. There is nothing weird about getting omega-3 from plants, all of which contain small amounts of it. Lots of people flourish without eating seafood -- see Weston Price. I have never heard that people need to get their omega-3 from fish.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read your theory on why flax O3 is not an inferior form of O3 several times, but do not recall reading accounts of self-experimentation pitting flax O3 vs. more putatively bioavailable sources of O3, like any of the various fish oils.  Have you done self-experimentation of this kind?  If not, why not?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Two reasons. 1. Busy studying less obvious things that seem to change brain function. 2. Problem of mercury in fish oil. The source of omega-3 is a kind of interaction (the omega-3 effect may vary with source), whereas there are still plenty of main effects to study.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The Buttermind Experiment...&quot;

I was thinking that butter might actually be better, if you get high-quality butter.  Butter contains butyric acid (named for butter) which is metabolized in beta-hydroxybutyrate, the primary ketone fuel source of the body.

Coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides, which are also metabolized into ketones.  The evidence I&#039;ve seen for mental improvement is limited to those with Alzheimer&#039;s and a specific genetic marker (that predisposes to Alzheimer&#039;s):

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Based on this explanation, what would you predict?&quot;

I&#039;d expect that any other source of dietary ketones would have similar effects (such as coconut or MCT oil).  As would, after an adaptation period, a ketogenic diet.  I&#039;ve done this myself of late, and now associate carb consumption with fuzzy-headedness.  I&#039;ve not done the self-testing that you&#039;ve done, however.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. The Buttermind Experiment included a coconut oil condition. People who ate coconut oil did not become faster at arithmetic. I don&#039;t know of any evidence that coconut oil improves brain function. That supports the idea that it is the omega-3, not the ketones.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Check units.  The chart gives more than 2 grams of omega 3 per 10 grams for flaxseed.  60 grams would be maybe 13 grams of omega 3 per day.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;High consumption of omega-3 should protect me against bad effects of omega-6. For example, when I eat peanuts (high in omega-6), my brain test scores don’t change.&quot;

From what I&#039;ve read, it&#039;s pretty clear that excess o-6 largely blocks conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to long-chain o-3.  Consuming more ALA doesn&#039;t alter that. But regardless, I wouldn&#039;t expect one day of o-6 consumption to have a significant effect on o-3 composition of membranes in the brain (which is why long-chain o-3 is required).  If the conversion of ALA to long-chain o-3 is what&#039;s driving your increased mental capacity...

There is another explanation, however, for your experience.  ALA is converted to ketones preferentially over o-6 fatty acids, and ketones are a preferred fuel for the brain.  Ketogenic diets, as I&#039;m sure you&#039;re aware, are used to treat and cure several brain malfunctions, such as epilepsy.

&quot;For example, the oxidation of alpha-linolenic acid is twice that of linoleic acid or oleic acid. Therefore, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid are the most ketogenic fatty acids and enriching a highfat diet with those compounds increases its ketogenic potential. This is the reason that a diet high in flaxseed oil (which contains 60% of alpha-linolenic acid) is more ketogenic and offers more seizure protection than those using other dietary sources of ketones, at least in animal models (Likhodii et al., 2000).&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Apologies if you&#039;ve mentioned this previously, but in what manner do you consume 60g of flax meal a day?

Straight, mixed in yogurt, w/ pb&amp;j???

Ok, that last one might be self-defeating :-), but I have 3 kids I have to deal with supplement.

I&#039;ve been giving them mega-EPA fish oil caps for a couple years now. They make a marked difference in my oldest&#039; behavior (&amp; in my wife&#039;s mood back when she was breast feeding), but they are not without concerns. I&#039;m not sure on how much is hype and how much is truth as to the molecular distillation vs. tri-glyceride &amp; EPA vs. DHA forms. There&#039;s an enormous difference in cost among the types. So, all in all, I think I&#039;d prefer a good whole food source if we can reasonably work it into our daily diet.

OT: Its very hard to beat the convenience of a little magic pill. I can see why pharma is able to do so well for itself.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I eat the ground flaxseed mixed with yogurt. Recently I&#039;ve gone down to 30 g flaxseeds per day...I&#039;m not sure which is better.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
