		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I can fail to predict earthquakes, but still can know how to send emergency relief to cities hurt by them. I can fail to predict a bout of the flu, but still know how to treat symptoms. I can fail to predict financial crises, but still can know how to respond to one.&quot;

You are arguing because you know how to send emergency relief and treat flu symptoms you know how to respond to a financial crisis? I hope not. 1. Earthquakes. We don&#039;t know what causes them, don&#039;t pretend to. 2. Flu. Do you know how to reduce how often you get the flu in the future? Probably not. Yet that would be a good idea. In addition to treating symptoms. 3. Financial crisis. Surely it would be a good idea to reduce the chances of later crises. People who failed to predict the 2008 crisis are not good choices for doing this.

I was talking about reducing risk, not treating symptoms.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I agree with some of what you say, not all. 

(1)  We can know from experience and history how to treat diseases or financial crises even if we don&#039;t fully understand fundamentals.   

Science is never-ending.  In that sense, there is always more to learn, which means we are all, always, ignorant about everything.   

(2)   I can fail to predict earthquakes, but still can know how to send emergency relief to cities hurt by them.   I can fail to predict a bout of the flu, but still know how to treat symptoms.  I can fail to predict financial crises, but still can know how to respond to one.  

(3)   History has plenty of examples of default on sovereign debt.   Books of case histories have been written.   We can see how Greece is doing right now.   We can look at recent decades in Argentina.  We can look at Russia in 1998.   But there has not been a default on sovereign debt by a reserve currency ever that I know of, perhaps with the exception of the collapse of the Roman Empire.   It is like playing Russian roulette:  better not to test the hypothesis outside of a laboratory.  

(4)  If someone with a bad record of making predictions warns you not to step in a bear trap, it might be wise to listen.]]></description>
