		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, 

I&#039;ll vouch for Sarno. I&#039;ve given the book to at least a dozen people who were considering back surgery and/or in serious pain and it worked in all cases. 

He comes from a  psychodynamic perspective (repressed narcissistic rage is a key construct) that might be over theorizing. As I read him, he is essentially working on an ethical way to elicit the placebo effect transparently. 

I recommend this book to anyone with back pain or anything else that might be psychodynamic (which is lots).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[4 years ago I also got rid of back pain by reading John-Sarno&#039;s book, the mind body prescription. When I started reading this blog I was wondering how it is possible Sarno&#039;s  thoughts for pain hasn&#039;t cought Seth Roberts attention (since other meaningful heresies related to medicine had).]]></description>
