		<description><![CDATA[Yes, honey is sugar.  But then, so are ALL carbohydrates! Used judiciously, say, for infrequent baking, it&#039;s no big deal.  Since baking, per se, is emphatically not paleo, neither would using fruit be paleo. But Loren Cordain, the Godfather of paleo, says that the 80-20 rule is probably good enough.  Eat strictly paleo 80% of the time, and bend the rules a bit the other 20% of the time. Which is what I do.

Nota bene: From a strictly paleo point of view, eating a little honey once in a great while is probably better for you than eating fruit everyday, because hunter/gatherers couldn&#039;t possibly have had fruit available to them all year long. It&#039;s a seasonal item.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honey is pure sugar. It is hunter gatherers favorite food. 

Paleo guys should just eat fruit.

&quot;Order Without Law&quot; is a good book.

		<description><![CDATA[There were some sweets, but they were limited to seasonal fruits, perhaps for a few weeks of the year. Perhaps some sugar cane, which was simply sucked on, not processed and added to every food. Paleo-style desserts are at least as tasty as sugar-laden sweets. The sweetness comes from things like stevia, xylitol, honey, dates, fruits, and maple syrup.

For example, I can make you some chocolate avocado brownies that you will never be able to tell from regular old brownies. You would never know they were made from avocados if I didn&#039;t tell you beforehand. And they contain ZERO sugar!]]></description>
