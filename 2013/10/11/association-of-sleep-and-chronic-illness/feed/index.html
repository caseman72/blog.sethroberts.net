		<description><![CDATA[I was under the impression that sleep cycles followed a 90 minute ultradian rhythm... If that&#039;s the case then 7.5 hours sleep would be ideal as you would awake towards the end of the cycle whereas people sleeping 6.5 hours would be awoken in the middle of the cycle. Perhaps that could be something to consider, maybe 6 hours would be better than 6.5 hours]]></description>

Yes, I have considered wearing a sleep mask. It&#039;s something I plan to try. I don&#039;t worry about dawn light while asleep any more since I wake up before dawn.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Confirmatory study and an cheap DIY intervention--

Michael Mosley (of Eat Fast) participated in a study where the changed sleep from 6.5 to 7.5 hr, and did blood draws for quick feedback. A summary is at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444634. Think the meat is in the video, but it&#039;s region-blocked :(
--
(Seven) volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was asked to sleep for six-and-a-half hours a night, the other got seven-and-a-half hours. After a week the researchers took blood tests and the volunteers were asked to switch sleep patterns. The group that had been sleeping six-and-a-half hours got an extra hour, the other group slept an hour less.
...
the most interesting results came from the blood tests that were run.

Dr Simon Archer and his team at Surrey University were particularly interested in looking at the genes that were switched on or off in our volunteers by changes in the amount that we had made them sleep.

&quot;We found that overall there were around 500 genes that were affected,&quot; Archer explained. &quot;Some which were going up, and some which were going down.&quot;

What they discovered is that when the volunteers cut back from seven-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours&#039; sleep a night, genes that are associated with processes like inflammation, immune response and response to stress became more active. The team also saw increases in the activity of genes associated with diabetes and risk of cancer. The reverse happened when the volunteers added an hour of sleep.

================
Improving sleep quality by blocking blue light @night. Seth, what color were the lights in your Berkley bedroom?

Reduced sleep latency, more deep sleep (per Zeo). Works for me, and the glasses are $9. No-brainer.]]></description>

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t pay attention to any of that. Sometimes I wonder what effect it would have if I slept on the floor but I haven&#039;t found out.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve noticed a while ago that for some reason if I drank coke with dinner I always felt terrible the next day and didn&#039;t sleep well even though I would avoid sugar most of the time. I thought it was the sugar that gave me hangover like symptoms and unrefreshed sleep, but I had done &#039;carb back loading&#039; with heaps of sugary foods and junk and slept well after, but if I drank coke I didn&#039;t feel refreshed the next day. After a while I realised it might be the caffeine. 
Also I noticed that the honey wasn&#039;t as effective if I had caffeine in the afternoon or evening. Alcohol seems to effect sleep also for me - it helps me sleep but I don&#039;t wake up feeling refreshed. It&#039;s so hard to get everything right. Recently I tried drinking one cup of tea at 10am and no caffeine after, I found that I felt terrible in the middle of the afternoon but that night I had really vivid dreams, two of the dreams that night were flying dreams which was cool. I think eating chocolate after dinner kind of messes things up also, but a glass of milk without chocolate has similar effects to honey. But it gives me acne... 
I&#039;ve even got to the point where I think that flossing before bed and brushing my teeth improves my sleep but that&#039;s just ridiculous! The honey and caffeine thing makes sense but the oral hygiene thing is probably a bit far fetched. I do have a lot of light exposure though in the evening so I haven&#039;t really dealt with that as a factor. I&#039;m also a little worried that the honey might raise my set point so I don&#039;t always do it, plus I think it isn&#039;t as effective if you do it everyday for some reason.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Maas does say this. This is from a Cornell press release about a book by Maas: 



&lt;blockquote&gt;The book also includes two tests to help the reader determine how well they sleep, the costs of sleep loss and research findings that link poor sleep with colds, flu, unhealthy skin, weight gain, diabetes, heart disease and cancer, as well as stress, anxiety and depression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Most days I wake up feeling more tired then when I went to bed the night before, however I find that if I take up to a tablespoon of raw honey immediately before bed I almost always wake up feeling totally refreshed. I&#039;ve suffered from low energy, brain fog, fatigue and sore muscles for years and I tried eliminating food groups (dairy, grains, nightshades, etc) but that didn&#039;t fix the problems (although wheat has been problematic) but taking the honey did. 
I usually sleep without any problems that I&#039;m aware of even if I awaken feeling unrefreshed I will still sleep through the night and won&#039;t awaken early or whatever, but the crucial thing is I feel rested when I wake up, if I get that right I can even eat bad food and feel good all day. I&#039;ve tried coconut oil and coconut oil combined with honey but they didn&#039;t work. 
I&#039;ve also noticed caffeine later in the day and chocolate have a huge impact on this. There are a lot of factors that come in to play so the honey thing doesn&#039;t always work, but it can make a big difference. I think the fructose helps replenish liver glycogen which may help me get more deep sleep but I don&#039;t know for certain]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I think you are correct that bad sleep causes illness. However, that people sleep more when sick, is imo generally true more so for acute than chronic disease. I believe that in chronic disease one may find oneself in a vicious cycle: poor sleep contributes to the chronic condition, the chronic condition in turn (e.g., through pain) contributes to poor sleep. A very tough proposition.]]></description>
