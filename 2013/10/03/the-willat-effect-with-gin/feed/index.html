		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t pass up the opportunity to recommend Hendrick&#039;s Scottish gin. This is the king of gins in my view. 

They use cucumber in it&#039;s production and it&#039;s best enjoyed with a slice of cucumber in place of the usual slice of lime. 

Hmm, is it too early for gin? ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had a similar experience with Vodka. A friend of mine started a distillery in Maryland and my former boss had invested in or sat on the board of another distillery. We decided to sit down and compare. This is interesting, as the whole point of vodka is to not have a taste. Nevertheless, there was a distinct smoothness or &quot;roundness&quot; to one of them. The other was sharp and had an odd burnt wood flavor. 

Also interesting, but not related. My friend explained that he chose vodka as his first product given a) it isn&#039;t really supposed to have a taste, just use good water, good grains, ferment and filter. b) it is the best start up liquor for a distillery as there is no aging process. Therefore, you get a quick return on investment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also worth trying (in addition to Gordon&#039;s, of course) are

Adnam&#039;s First Rate Gin
Original Bombay Dry Gin
Oxley Cold Distilled London Dry Gin.

I&#039;m sure there are other contenders: you could have some pleasant evenings ahead.]]></description>
