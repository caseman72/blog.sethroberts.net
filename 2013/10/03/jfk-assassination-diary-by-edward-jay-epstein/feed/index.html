		<description><![CDATA[Related to this is how some investigations refuse to consider eye-witness evidence.   My vague memory after all these years is that people heard bullets coming from a different direction than from the window where Oswald was.  This testimony was discounted.

But here are two other incidents where this happened:

1.  The airplane that blew up in the sky over the south shore of Long Island back in (I think) the early 90&#039;s.  Many eyewitnesses on the beaches said they saw something flying in the sky hit the airplane.  This included ex-military people who knew what a missile looked like in the air.  All of these testimonies were discarded in the investigation because they obviously didn&#039;t know what they were looking at.  I remember a ridiculous animation put on TV by the government that tried to explain that the aircraft just broke in half somehow on its own.  What was funny was that parts of their explanation apparently conflicted with the laws of gravity and other scientific basics.

2.  Again in the 90s I think, an American ship shot down an Iranian civilian airplane, killing many people.  The electronic equipment on the ship somehow convinced the commander that it was a military plane and had to be shot down because of where it was and how it was maneuvering.  However, sailors on the ship were able to use their own eyes to tell that it was a civilian airplane.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Normally I pay no heed to JFK assassination yarns, but I saw one the other day that raised a wry smile.  The proposition was that when JFK was first shot, the car behind jolted and a secret service man aboard accidentally fired a shot which was the one that removed much of Kennedy&#039;s head.


The wry smile was caused by the thought that many of the claimed inconsistencies in the evidence might be explained not by a huge conspiracy, but by a simple accident.


On the who gains principle, LBJ must be the main suspect.  On the principle of cuckolded men seeking revenge, the field is too large to contemplate.

As for why journalists are not inquisitive, the answer is probably the same as for why dogs lick their balls.]]></description>
