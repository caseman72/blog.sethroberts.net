		<description><![CDATA[Spoke too soon! Here&#039;s what Wikipedia says about Onggi pots:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Vertebration

Onggi has one strong advantage over other containers: it is not affected by use or natural phenomena. In fact, onggi can withstand exposure to strong sunshine and rain for a long time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, that clears that up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Furthermore, the clay pot has properties such as biodegradability, rotproofness and vertebration which are all critical elements for storing Kimchi for a prolonged period.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I pride myself on having an ample vocabulary but am stumped by the word &quot;vertebration&quot;.  The pot has vertebra?

Now that I think about it, it could be &quot;ventilation&quot;.

Rotproofness also was troubling -- how could it be rotproof and biodegradable &lt;i&gt;at the same time&lt;/i&gt;?  But I think they mean &quot;anti-fungal&quot; here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had a pint of Erdinger(hefe) that had sat in a poorly maintained keg in a bar in Wan Chai for so long that it had gone pleasantly sour. I had drank proper Belgian lambics before and it was so close, that I actually just finished the beer without complaining and appreciated that a lambic in Hong Kong would have cost me alot more, if I could even find one!]]></description>
