`

All curriculum/syllabus standards are arbitrary &amp; subjective everywhere and always. 

 It is impossible for them to be otherwise.

Inability to grasp this basic fact leads to huge conceptual errors in  &quot;education&quot;, &quot;teaching&quot;, &quot;student status&quot;, &quot;values&quot;, &quot;priority sets&quot;,  &quot;math&quot;, &quot;science&quot;, &quot;history&quot;,  etc, etc.

There are a million subjects that &#039;could&#039; be taught in high-school, with a vast array of possible learning methods.  Even the &#039;need&#039; for a teacher is totally arbitrary, as are despotic truancy laws depriving students of basic human liberty.

 No matter how valuable somebody believes a subject may be-- there are only 24 hours in a day, and an arbitrary decision to teach one subject (algebra ?) is also a decision NOT to teach a million other subjects.   

Most high-school and college curricula and teaching methods have barely changed since medieval times. The denizens of the educational-establishment can not see the big picture and  have an extremely narrow view of &quot;education reform&quot;  and student values/choices/freedoms.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Roger.

Rollins, you wound me! I hate reading self-congratulatory teachers. I was doing exactly the opposite of that. I was explaining my priorities in the context of a debate of reform vs. traditional math (I ascribe to neither camp). Seth asked me to elaborate in email, and I stressed several times that I didn&#039;t want to sound like a pompous teacher doing some narcissistic backpatting. 

But the reality is that most math teachers believe, passionately, in their subject. They believe that the solution to the achievement gap is to raise standards, work hard, and love math. Education reformers also believe that the problem is low standards, that all kids could learn math if they had good teachers.

I am explaining a priority set that is quite different. Seth asked me to elaborate on one particular piece of that.

It&#039;s pretty ludicrous to paint me as a teacher who believes in arbitrary curriculum standards, since I regularly post that I do exactly the opposite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rollins, you are absolutely right that &quot;algebra &amp; geometry are of no practical use to most people in their entire personal lives&quot; and that in that sense the students &quot;were wasting their time in that algebra classroom.&quot;

However, in terms of getting a credential, you are absolutely wrong.  They need to pass algebra to graduate and they need a high school diploma to get considered for many, many jobs--even if the job has nothing to do with algebra.  The American legal system allows, even encourages, that.  Education Realist&#039;s students don&#039;t want to be shut out of the &quot;good jobs.&quot;

ER knows all this.  Don&#039;t hate the player; hate the game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seems rather a tale of an egocentric teacher publicly praising himself for his supposed selfless devotion to his students values and goals.

Many student, especially Elijah, quite understandably hated high school math... and wanted out of this teacher&#039;s classroom.  The teacher had exactly zero empathy and support for that clearly stated &#039;value&#039;.

Instead, the teacher proclaimed his own &#039;teacher-value&#039; to the class -- &quot;everyone to pass this class&quot; ... even if they don&#039;t ever like or understand algebra... and that somehow this algebra-classroom-experience would most certainly improve their lives ever after.

In fact, algebra &amp; geometry are of no practical use to most people in their entire personal lives.  Most American K-12 &quot;education&quot; is merely social ritual.  The students correctly assessed they were wasting their time in that algebra classroom.  

But the teacher-bureaucrat could only see the arbitrary syllabus and daily disciplining of his captive audience... while arrogantly pretending to be empowering the values of his students.]]></description>
