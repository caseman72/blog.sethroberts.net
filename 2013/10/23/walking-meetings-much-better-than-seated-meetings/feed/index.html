		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I think spoken (face to face) comments are much better than written ones because they allow the recipient to ask questions.&quot;

For me personally, I don&#039;t think this would be the case. For one, my mental processing seems slower/less robust with oral communication. (Though my hearing tests fine, I sometimes have trouble deciphering words that I hear, vs words that I see.) For another, I like to have a hard copy to refer back to. I think it&#039;s worth keeping in mind that you may have some students for whom this is true, and maybe adapt the format to support different learning styles if the need arises.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I suspect my 100 spoken words would be more helpful than my 10 written words. Writing is much harder than speaking, especially handwriting (typing is easier than handwriting). After they talk to me, my students make a written summary of what I tell them -- so that is a hard copy.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For some reason, I can&#039;t see the comments on this post. Clicking on the recent comments links doesn&#039;t work either.

Any thoughts about how you&#039;d accommodate people for whom walking is difficult or impossible? People with radically different walking speeds?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: If someone can&#039;t walk, I would meet with them without walking.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also -- and this is totally unrelated, but I just thought of it -- have you ever read _Self-Help Without the Hype_ by Robert Epstein? It&#039;s a book that strongly encourages self-experimentation.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the recommendation. I haven&#039;t seen it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
