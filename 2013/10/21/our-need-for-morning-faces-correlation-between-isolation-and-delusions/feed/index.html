		<description><![CDATA[CC (&amp; Seth): I grew up in NYC. On the subway you may be only 6 inches from someone else&#039;s face, *but you&#039;re not looking at it*. We deliberately avoid the appearance of social contact, because being that close normally implies intimacy. 

And even if we are looking straight at a person&#039;s face in the subway, we still normally don&#039;t treat the sight / eye-contact as we were conversing with that person. We have our shells up. I would not be a bit surprised if that made a major difference in the psychological effects.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I should have proofread before I posted. What I meant was &quot;Can Isolation Cause Delusions?&quot;, with the change intended to imply that isolation might cause delusions rather rather than that it reliably does cause delusions.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, that&#039;s a good change.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that &quot;Can Isolation Cause Hallucinations?&quot; would be a more accurate title.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Hallucinations is when you see things. But maybe &quot;delusions&quot; is too weak. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; The faces need to be similar to what you’d see in a conversation. Looking at people on the subway doesn’t count.&quot;

Wait, why not?  We&#039;re all standing pretty close together on the subway.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: What you see needs to be very close to what you see during an ordinary conversation.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
