		<description><![CDATA[Great info,  I have also had good success with this diet.  The best part is the lack of hunger.  Most diets are an arm wrestling match between the conscious and sub-conscious in regards to cravings for foods which I believe are related to the taste associations.  I eat a regular breakfast at 5am.  I do the ELOO at 9am.  Around 1pm I am rarely hungry, and I have found a large apple or a cup of coffee and a handful of nuts works the rest of the day. Around 4pm I do the ELOO again and usually have dinner around 7pm.  Not having to rely on will-power is the best thing about this diet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your &quot;are you dieing&quot; observation is right on. After losing 25lbs on a strict paleo diet, a long time barista at a Starbucks were I had been a regular customer took me aside after not seeing me for a couple of months and ask if I was &quot;ok&quot; (are you sick, do you have cancer, are you dieing). Even my adult children expressed their concern to their mother. I&#039;m small framed and the weight loss was quite noticeable. Funny thing is, my new weight was/is exactly what I weighed in my twenties - at that time I was just the small guy, not the sick guy.
