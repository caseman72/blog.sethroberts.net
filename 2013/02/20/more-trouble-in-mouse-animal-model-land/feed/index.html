		<description><![CDATA[Reminds me of a Mulla Nasrudin (after Idres Shaw. Seems the Mulla was on his hands and knees under a lamp post. When asked why he was, the Mulla said, &quot;I&#039;m looking for my keys.&quot; Several people started to help him, and after a while someone asked him where he lost his keys. He said, &quot;Over there in that dark area.&quot; &quot;Then why are you looking here!? &quot;The light is better here, I&#039;d never find them in the dark.&quot;

Perhaps we could use raccoons, they have  similar diets and have hands.

Oh, yes and the problem of using genetically identical animals makes statistical analysis easier, but misses the point, some things may be quite toxic to a small fraction of the population and harmless to the vast majority or vice versa. For example, some people are very salt sensitive and get high blood pressure, but the majority has trivial effects from salt. So there is a movement to cut down salt from everybody.]]></description>
