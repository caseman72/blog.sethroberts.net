		<description><![CDATA[I think there is more to the bra-breast cancer thing than just breast size.  There have been various studies that do show correlation of breast size with cancer, but there are also others that suggest the wearing of bras, especially at night, interferes with the function of lymph nodes by constriction.  Impaired lymph function  can also lead to a decrease in melatonin, a known risk factor for cancer.

I&#039;m sure it would be hard to get funding for a serious bra- breast cancer study!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, that makes sense. And I agree with your basic point that the connection should have been studied, once it was noticed.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of something I found while writing a review of breast cancer prevention methods.  Back in the 1980s, an amateur scientist had noticed that some women she (he? don&#039;t remember now) knew who wore their bras in their sleep had gotten breast cancer.  So she interviewed many women at random and found that women who wore bras at night were something like 20 times as likely to develop breast cancer.

Unfortunately, instead of getting a respectable scientist interested, she published a book on her findings.  This made the breast cancer/bra connection toxic.  Despite indicating a much stronger association with breast cancer than any known behavioral factor, no &quot;respectable scientist&quot; in America or western Europe has ever investigated this.  Now two studies have come out on it, one in China and one in Eastern Europe, both indicating a strong connection between wearing a bra at night and breast cancer.  This discovery could not have been made in the US or in western Europe, because the claim had been made toxic &quot;crank&quot; material by being promoted by amateurs.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I remember that finding, which I read about in the National Enquirer. I think the researcher failed to control for breast size -- women with larger breasts were more likely to wear a bra at night. It&#039;s no surprise that if you have larger breasts (i.e., more breast cells) you are more likely to get breast cancer. This may be why it was ignored.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[related to davids comment about Max Planck. Many readers of this blog we are probably interested in the topic: extension of lifespan. so this is something to make us feel uncomfortable. Also there is the thought that nature by using death gives various benefits to evolution. Science is not a very natural activity so maybe the choice nature has made for our lifespan is bad for doing science, if Max Planck was right maybe it should have been smaller.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: I think the problem is self-correcting in a way different from what Planck said. Science, although unnatural, produces great benefits. Those benefits increase how much free time we have, time that we don&#039;t have to work. During their free time, some people do science as a hobby. Science was a hobby for Mendel and Darwin, for example. When science is a hobby, the scientist is perfectly free to seek the truth and nothing but the truth. As our free time increases (and the cost of doing science decreases) more and more people will do science as a hobby. Personal science -- science done to help yourself -- is a big part of what they will do. As hobby science increases, total science -- professional science plus hobby science -- will become more accurate.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
