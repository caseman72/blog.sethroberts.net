		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
How can we translate your thinking about diversity in teaching to how managers guide people to get work done in the work place - e.g., flexible work schedules or working from home.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: There is a book called First Break All the Rules that discusses exactly this point. I blogged about it here: http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/12/my-theory-of-human-evolution-business-book-edition/. I can&#039;t remember what it says. I have never been a manager, but I guess I would meet with each employee and start by saying something like this: &quot;I have no interest in making you like everyone else. All I care about is that you get your work done and help your co-workers get their work done. How do you think you can best accomplish that?&quot; Workers in many jobs are much more interdependent than students so I suppose if someone works from home they would need to be always available for phone calls during working hours except during lunch hour.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
