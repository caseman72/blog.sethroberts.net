		<description><![CDATA[Is your friend a young person?

I have a Chinese roommate who is a PhD candidate at Berkeley in microbiology. He says this attitude is a generational change, partly as a backlash to the huge pressure, and partly due to the shift to money-making as a desirable goal.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes. My friend is in her twenties. Consistent with what your roommate says.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the UK, &quot;you are a swot&quot; comes close.  It implies that to do well in exams you have to devote your time to them rather than being so naturally bright that you can make time to fit lots of other things into your life too.  Of course, it rather overlooks the fact that some children are probably well fitted to being swots, and that some who disparage swots could scarcely do well in an exam however many hours they worked.]]></description>
