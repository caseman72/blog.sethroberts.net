		<description><![CDATA[The fact that Juarerro uses the phrase &quot;begs the question&quot; correctly---i.e. with complete fidelity to the _petitio principii_ of classical logic---is a good sign that she knows what&#039;s going on.  It&#039;s always windbags like Deacon who screw those things up.  (BTW, re &quot;leftie academics&quot;:  Based on my own acquaintances I&#039;d bet dollars to donuts that Juarerro is more left-wing than Deacon.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Boston tea party was perpetrated by tea smugglers who were outraged that a reduction in the duty on tea meant that they would no longer be able to undercut the legit importer and thus would lose their livelihoods.   I have no connection with that event which happened some time before I was born.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Interesting. I hadn&#039;t heard that explanation before but it makes more sense than what I was taught.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
