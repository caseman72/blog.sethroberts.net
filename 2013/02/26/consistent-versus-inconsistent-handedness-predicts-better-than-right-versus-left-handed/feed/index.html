		<description><![CDATA[As an inconsistent-hander, I have always snickered at those detective stories that include a scene in which a left-handed potential suspect is ruled out because some crime was obviously committed by a right-hander. I wonder how much this particular misconception has affected real police work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting. Like some of the earlier posters I&#039;ve never known how to properly specify which hand is dominant. I write with my right, play golf, lacrosse and bat with my left, snowboard goofy (typical for lefties), play ping pong right, etc. Never occurred to me that there might be a difference in handedness between arm and wrist as Seth writes. I&#039;m also clearly right eye dominant which may play into things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My handedness is exactly the same as Seth has described.  I think  of it as being lefty for forehand actions and righty for backhand ones, but the wrist-arm breakdown may be closer to the mark.

I&#039;m not that good a leader, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very interesting. I&#039;ve always had trouble specifying which is my dominant hand. 

I do things such as writing and brushing my teeth with my left hand, but when I was learning to play golf, left-handed clubs didn&#039;t work out. I also use my right hand for tennis and ping pong.

Saying that I&#039;m inconsistently handed seems much more accurate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Left-handers die younger?  Then why didn&#039;t my life insurance company ask me if I was left-handed?

Seriously, I thought this was urban legend that was debunked long ago (people once claimed a 7 year difference in life expectancy, which is crazy).  But maybe there&#039;s new information I don&#039;t know about?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I looked around for new evidence about the longevity difference. I couldn&#039;t find any. As far as I could tell, several studies support the idea that left-handers die younger, and a few studies do not, in the sense of no significant difference (either way). Absence of a significant effect is weak evidence. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My mother told me that I was left-handed as a tiny child and seemed to have swapped to right-handedness by copying the rest of the family.  Does that happen or was my mother mistaken?  A counterargument is that falling in with people around me is not one of my most conspicuous traits.  A supporting argument is that as a soccer player I was noticeably more &quot;two footed&quot; than most of my teammates - so much so that I was usually played on the left.
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: maybe there is also &quot;inflexible handed&quot; and &quot;flexible handed&quot;. You are flexible handed. Your story about changing the hand you write with suggests testing everyone to see how good they are at writing with the less-usual hand (e.g., right handers write with their left hand). That would be good research. Would not depend on self-report (e.g., &quot;which foot do you prefer to kick with?&quot;).&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
