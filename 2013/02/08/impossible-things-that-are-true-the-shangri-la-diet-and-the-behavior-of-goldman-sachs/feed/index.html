		<description><![CDATA[There is a sense in which one key insight of SLD is deeply implicit in our everyday understanding of hunger, eating and overeating. If you ask people who would weigh more, someone eating a diet of plain brown rice and steamed vegetables, or someone eating a diet that included a lot of cakes, cookies, ice cream, and so on, everyone will say the latter would cause weight gain. But ask them why? Why wouldn&#039;t they both eat the same number of calories that would satisfy their hunger and why wouldn&#039;t that be exactly the same. Why wouldn&#039;t they both eat the same number of calories and stop? Then people will slowly find themselves reasoning in such a way that leads to the conclusion that something about cakes, cookies and ice cream must somehow generate more hunger, must cause them to &quot;pig out&quot; or get &quot;addicted&quot;. 

The most stunning comment anyone ever made to me about weight loss was when I weighed 280 pounds, and after I described my diet and the foods that I pigged out on (high in sugar and fat), Seth said to me: &quot;Interesting that no one ever pigs out on fruits and vegetables.&quot; 

It stopped me cold...]]></description>

Some boxers and MMA fighters have lost 50 pounds extremely quickly but much of this water weight. I&#039;m not sure you could lose 20 kilograms of fat and muscle in so short a time without amputating a leg.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth.

Yes, SLD sounds like a very crazy idea and a stupid thing to do. How on earth will you lose weight drinking frigging oil? 

This morning I was just thinking on how will I explain my new look to my parents when they see me? Last time I went to visit them (December 2012) I was about 125 kilos. 

After only a month living in Shangri-la I am 105 kilos... or something like that. 

They&#039;ll be in shock and they&#039;ll want to know my new &quot;diet&quot; because all their life have been struggling with weight too. We&#039;re a family of big people and terrible nutrition habits! 

SLD is not for people thinking inside the box. SLD means reading, researching and willing to experiment in oneself. 

Sadly not everyone is comfortable doing that.]]></description>
