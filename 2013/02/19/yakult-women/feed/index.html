&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It&#039;s puzzling that they don&#039;t add more bacteria, which would make the product more valuable.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yakult is very popular in Mexico. There are peddlers selling it door to door and in the street, specially outsides elementary schools. 

Peddlers even have a subscription business model!

Thanks to an ad in the 80&#039;s, moms now trust Yakult. I recall the tv ad was an anime that explained how probiotics fought evil bacteria inside the human body. It was funny.

Also, Mexico is a country where most of the population suffers from gastritis and colitis thanks to spice and peppers in pretty much any meal. Hell, even candy are hot.

It&#039;s thought that Yakult helps prevent and heal those diseases. Drinking Yakult is a must for millions.

Even more, Yakult has a very good reputation now a days thanks to charismatic and inspiring Carlos Kasuga Osaka, Yakult&#039;s CEO for Mexico (Distribuidora Kai). 

He speaks in conferences and is a YouTube star here. Ergo, a lot of people love Yakult. 

I like it, but have it maybe once a year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Selling Yakult door to door is quite common in São Paulo, Brazil, not on the street though.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I read that in Brazil Yakult is considered a way to become lactose tolerant.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t imagine how Yakult which is just loaded with sugar is a very good way to get probiotics. But yes here in Singapore people give this sugary stuff to their kids and feel good about it. Then again they also pass off watered down chocolate/malt beverage(aka Milo) as a healthy sports drink to rival Gatorade.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gastric cancer rates are generally much higher in East Asia than in the US or Europe

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I was under the impression that was because of high salt content. For example, miso is salty.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
