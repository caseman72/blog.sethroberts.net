		<description><![CDATA[A friend was mildly concerned about her blood pressure - it was on the high side.  Now, perhaps six months later, it&#039;s tickety-boo.  The only change to her diet that she can think of is that she&#039;s started eating half a banana at breakfast every day.

Then again, perhaps it&#039;s just one of those things.

		<description><![CDATA[@ Nancy - Ned Kock did an &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthcorrelator.blogspot.ca/2013/01/how-much-alcohol-is-optimal-maybe-less.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;excellent analysis&lt;/a&gt; of that one also.

It is amazing how often the advice/conclusions of these studies get &quot;politically corrected&quot; such that it is at odds with the very data they have produced!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What was more interesting was that when there turned out to be no evidence that eggs were dangerous, instead of saying that, they said &quot;Well, you can have a few eggs a week&quot;.

See also, evidence that moderate drinking might be good for people resulting in saying &quot;but that doesn&#039;t mean we think anyone should start drinking&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That egg-heart connection is nonsense and has been pushed by a certain Dr. Spence who takes quite some money for a pro-statin-pushing agenda.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It is nonsense, I agree. Many years ago it seemed like lots of people said that. Simply because eggs were high in cholesterol.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ned Kock did a moderating effects analysis of an earlier study that had found a link between egg yolk consumption and carotid plaque.

Turns out that what the study really showed was a correlation between being old and liking eggs.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Lotta great stuff at Kock&#039;s blog, which I didn&#039;t know about. Very easy to read.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
