		<description><![CDATA[Taking advantage of multiple processor cores, security, and of course minimizing impact of any crashes - this does not imply that they are expected to be frequent, even rare crashes could be annoying if they take down the whole application. Normal crash rate = what I observe across multiple computers and users. I personally use Chrome all day, every day on two different computers, visit a lot of &quot;suspicious&quot; sites and experience several crashes a year at most. Maybe you just have some atypical browsing habits, maybe there is a problem in some of your plugins (Flash), but frequent crashes could indicate a hardware problem - I had the same problem when I built a new computer; one of my memory sticks was faulty (as diagnosed by Memtest86+), the problem went away when I replaced it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree wtih the previous posters - this crash rate if either browser is definitely not normal, I would recommend running a stress-test on your hardware (OCCT - www.ocbase.com - is free, popular, and offers several mixes of CPU/memory tests). Also, AdBlock Plus plugin could help a lot, since most buggy code is some kind of intrusive advertising.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m curious: how do you know what crash rate is normal? If crash rate is usually very low -- as you seem to imply -- why did the designers of Chrome include localization from the beginning?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;d still run a memtest. It does not take much time (overnight) and it can eliminate or confirm the diagnosis. Firefox and Chrome do have a different memory footprint and memory allocation, so it is very possible that one hits a defective memory cell more often than another, causing more crashes.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, any thoughts about how more people could have the free time to do independent work?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think this is already happening. As people become more productive, they need to work less to produce enough money. Less work, more free time.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Firefox crashing daily? Either your hardware is defective or you&#039;re doing something way too extreme (50+ tabs open at the same time, 20+ youtube videos playing at the same time or something like that).

As I see, on my home machine I had 19 crashes since Jul 2010, last one was 1 Dec 2012. Previously most of the crashes were caused by buggy plug-ins, but once they were externalized into an independent process they no longer crash the browser.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I doubt it&#039;s my hardware since crashes became much rarer when I switched to Chrome. I never have 50 tabs open; I often get to 10. I rarely play more than 1 youtube video at a time. I think there must be a third explanation. Maybe the explanation is that lots of websites have buggy software, but I&#039;m not sure. Maybe you have more memory than me. Maybe it has something to do with being in China. In any case, localization was a feature of Chrome -- a difficult feature to add -- from the beginning for this very reason: because crashes happen pretty often.

How do you explain the increasing popularity of Chrome at the expense of Firefox? Crash rate is the only big difference between them that I&#039;ve noticed.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent post.  Have you written anywhere a complete article summarizing your arguments for how the institutionalization of science harms its progress?

Have you read Bruce Charlton&#039;s &quot;The Story of Real Science&quot;?  He gives reasons, some similar to yours, some different, for why he thinks science is dying in western civilization.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: A complete article, no. That&#039;s a good suggestion. I didn&#039;t know about Bruce Charlton&#039;s &quot;Story of Real Science&quot;, thanks for pointing it out.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A lot of interesting points. 

News media (especially if on paper) suffer from the job problem on the production side, too. They need to produce a certain amount of &quot;news&quot; per time period, regardless of how much is actually happening.

I haven&#039;t been able to find a useful review of back-up software. It&#039;s easy to find reviews of how easy it is to get the software to make backups (the job), but I haven&#039;t seen any reviews of how well the software restores (the black swan).

Have you read Root-Bernstein? (_Discovering_, _Sparks of Genius_) If I remember correctly, he says that great scientists pay a lot of attention to their tools so they can be sure they&#039;re measuring what they think they&#039;re measuring, and great discoveries tend to come from trying to solve a practical problem which is somewhat outside their specialty. He probably has more that I don&#039;t remember.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: News media is a very good example. They are so clearly disabled in other ways by their job, not just by the need for steady output. There are many things they can&#039;t say no matter what the truth is. I have read Discovering by Root-Bernstein but not Sparks of Genius. Discovering is one of the books I was thinking of when I said the advice about how to make discoveries was poor. Discoveries has about 10 or 20 pieces of advice that don&#039;t fit together well. None of which struck me as useful or explained anything I noticed myself. Sparks of Genius might be better, I&#039;ll look for it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A related issue is &#039;educated incapacity.&#039;

I also often use the phrase to describe the limitations of the expert—or even of just the &quot;well educated.&quot; The more expert—or at least the more educated—a person is, the less likely that person is to see a solution when it is not within the framework in which he or she was taught to think. When a possibility comes up that is ruled out by the accepted framework, an expert—or well-educated individual—is often less likely to see it than an amateur without the confining framework. For example, one naturally prefers to consult a trained doctor than an untrained person about matters of health. But if a new cure happens to be developed that is at variance with accepted concepts, the medical profession is often the last to accept it. This problem has always existed in all professions, but it tends to be accentuated under modern conditions.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, that is another important way that jobs (or job training) are disabling.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I ask from ignorance: do such colleges have the quality and quantity of research lab space, equipment and technical support that one would need?  I don&#039;t mean that they must equal the ever-growing empires of the top research universities, but there may be some ill-defined minimum that&#039;s necessary and which these colleges don&#039;t provide.

On the other hand: in Britain the funding bodies used to chunter about &quot;critical mass&quot; in research, an evident ploy to shut down any small research groups (or individuals) that might flourish.  I say &quot;ploy&quot; because I was once at a meeting where a bigshot bureaucrat was explaining this business and when I asked him about the evidence for his critical mass premise he could produce none.  That&#039;s &quot;none&quot; as in zero - not even a little bit.  I refrained from pointing out that his reasoning was therefore without weight, because the joke would have gone right over his head.  Scientists are happy to conspire with such oafs because it&#039;s the oafs who direct the funding for the scientists&#039; dreams of glory.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: At Reed College, in psychology, it seemed to me that the professors had enough resources to do most research. But psychology might be the lowest-tech laboratory science.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read your complaints about the professionalization of science many times, but it just occurred to me that they make a prediction: Why don&#039;t scientists at liberal arts colleges make all the breakthrough discoveries? They&#039;re like the olde-tyme professors you describe -- they have the training of professional scientists, but their advancement is determined by teaching success, with discovery viewed as a nice bonus.

I can think of a few reasons:

(1) They actually are making the breakthroughs (unlikely, but possible
(2) They actually have similar publication incentives as scientists at research universities (possible, especially at higher-tier colleges)
(3) Only bad scientists end up at liberal arts colleges (doubtful -- faculty hiring is extremely competitive)
(4) The teaching load at most liberal arts colleges is incompatible with any time-consuming hobby, including science (possible; 3-4 courses per semester is a lot, and they don&#039;t have grad students to do the grunt work)
(5) They are trained by professional scientists and have imported that worldview -- they see a teaching career as hamstringing, not liberating, their ability to do what they think of as science (my guess for Seth&#039;s preferred answer)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: One thing to keep in mind: liberal-arts colleges don&#039;t cover many subjects. For example, much of my research is about the intersection of nutrition and psychology. Liberal-arts schools don&#039;t have nutrition departments.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the most fascinating examples of this to me is incubators and who they choose to fund.

What&#039;s interesting is that the only reason incubators can exist is because the few black swans that account for their returns. Most companies suck, and a few fall in the &quot;succeed, but don&#039;t make us money&quot; category. Only a fraction do well enough to make the incubator money.

Here&#039;s Paul Graham, who runs one of the most successful incubators in the world, talking about how they specifically DON&#039;T pick an investment strategy that would make them the most money, because they want a steady stream of &quot;pretty good&quot; companies to look good at their job, rather than picking a strategy that would be more successful, but would cause them to look bad.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s an excellent example.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whoops, just read the last comment. Okay. Still think resilient is a candidate.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: derp is right. Anti-fragile means gains from disorder. Resilient, hardy, stable mean doesn&#039;t lose from disorder. I suppose Taleb was slightly wrong in the sense that hormetic means something pretty close to &quot;gains from disorder&quot;. Hormetic things (= things that show hormesis) gain from disorder -- up to a point. But they are the only anti-fragile things that exist. I read the book before publication. Blame me for not point this out at the time.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

I think Taleb just wanted to secure his google results by coining a new phrase.

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, thank you Seth, for that article. &quot;All of these systems were fashioned by nature, none by people with jobs.&quot; - quote of the day! As an MD, I rather give people useful advice on what changes to make and what to measure instead of prescribing stuff.

Elizabeth, Roger: Please read the introduction to Taleb&#039;s Anti-Fragile. Fragile means losing from disorder (entropy). Robust, durable, strong means NOT losing from disorder. Anti-fragile means gaining from disorder. That&#039;s the main point.]]></description>
