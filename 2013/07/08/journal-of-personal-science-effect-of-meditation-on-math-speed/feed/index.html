		<description><![CDATA[Erika: Thanks for the detailed reply, it&#039;s very helpful and I&#039;ll definitely take your recommendations into account for the next time. I&#039;m not sure how long I can realistically get people to meditate a half hour or more every day, but something more rigorous is definitely called for.

Gwern (and anyone else): I&#039;ve now posted the raw data at www.plewis.info (link at the bottom)

Justin: haven&#039;t heard of the emwave2. I once had a gadget that measured breathing through the oxygen content of your breath, you&#039;d hold your index finger on a sensor ... I think it was called the Stress Eraser or Stress Relaxer? Anyway I found that to be a helpful form of biofeedback for meditation. Heart rate might be a bit more useful but I don&#039;t know that either would really tell us &quot;why&quot; it works...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for posting this.

Anyone familiar with the emwave2 device? It&#039;s a commercial heart rate variability monitor, with desktop software. A biofeedback meditation aid. 

It would be worthwhile to do a similar experiment, using the HRV monitor as the treatment, instead of &#039;unguided&#039; meditation. It could tell us something about *why* meditation is helpful.

I hope I will stay focused this topic long enough to finish a study of my own...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a regular meditator and I have a couple of thoughts that might be helpful. I

I&#039;ve had a daily meditation practice for the last 6 years that was initially 15 minutes a day but increased to 2 hours a day (I&#039;m now meditating for 1 hour a day). I practice Zen mediation which is probably quite similar to the breath centered meditation mentioned.

- meditation is a skill that is developed. Individuals new to meditation may not see as much benefit if they aren&#039;t trying to learn that skill (rather than just thinking during that period of time). Personally, I think this may be part of why some studies on meditation are inconclusive.
- meditation takes time. I have personally experienced some dramatic changes because of my meditation practice but only after fairly significant periods of daily, consistent practice.
- I would say the real benefits begin to come after 30 minutes of daily practice. For me, there was a clear and noticeable difference about 2 weeks after beginning 30 minutes/day
- The biggest improvement came for me when I moved from 30 minutes/day to 1 hour/day. It took about 4 weeks to see that improvement.
- 2 hours a day was wonderful. Many of the things that make our lives harder are small day to day anxieties - the 1000 emotional paper cuts of interacting with other people. With this level of practice it is much easier to not take things personally. It&#039;s very hard to maintain 2 hours a day.

For me, this is what meditation does:
- removes some fear of suffering/pain. I find that I procrastinate significantly less because I don&#039;t have as much need to avoid those tasks. You might not think that you procrastinate because of suffering/pain but that&#039;s what I began to see when I started meditation.
- helps with anxiety
- helps you see more clearly what you are reacting to.

What I would recommend for your experiment:
- have another group of experienced meditators and have them increase the daily meditation time (with the minimum being 30 minutes). 
- have this group run the experiment for at least 2 months 
- I would have the group try and record their level of procrastination (although it might be hard to measure)

Cheers,
Erika]]></description>

<p>- meditation is a skill that is developed. Individuals new to meditation may not see as much benefit if they aren&#8217;t trying to learn that skill (rather than just thinking during that period of time).

- The biggest improvement came for me when I moved from 30 minutes/day to 1 hour/day. It took about 4 weeks to see that improvement.<br />
