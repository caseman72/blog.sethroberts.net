		<description><![CDATA[What did he eat on his non-fasting days? I&#039;m curious, because I&#039;m dealing with a candida infection and this account gives me hope.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: A later post will answer this in detail, but the short answer is: nothing unusual. He did not change his diet when he switched to alternate day fasting.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. I assume he drank water. Did he consume any liquid calories or probiotics (Yakult?) on his fasting days? I&#039;m tempted to try this - spare no detail.

Something is missing in the story. He didn&#039;t get to be an Ivy League math professor by being confused, exhausted, overwhelmed and depressed all the time. Were his indigestion and tiredness increasing in severity before he started the diet?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[jclifton - from a cursory reading of the first paper, I wasn&#039;t clear what the diet comprised.  I think food composition does make a difference to heart function.  I&#039;m yet to be convinced of the alternate day fasting as the cause-effect factor in atrial fibrillation and stiff heart disease.  I used to experience heart palpitations when I followed a low carb diet and had protein shakes with lots of whey protein and leucine.  When I reduced the protein powders, the heart was fine.

I&#039;m doing a version of shangri la on one meal a day.  I&#039;ve switched from oil to butter (oil fine at first, but in the second week I started to retch) and no heart problems.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -

Thanks for the details.  I&#039;ve been eating butter, flaxseed oil and home made kefir from all your posts on the health benefits.  Any thoughts on the health pros and cons of eating less of these foods or even skipping them completely some days while doing alternative day fasting?

&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: No, I have no relevant experience. I eat butter and flaxseed oil on fast days, for what it&#039;s worth. I want to keep brain function constant so that I can study the effect of other things on brain function.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

What do you eat on your fasting days when you&#039;re consuming 700 - 800 calories?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Butter, flaxseed oil, and a few other things.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, I&#039;ve followed and have been interested in IF and ADF for a year or so and have had mixed results.  Just doing some reading/reviewing of the yahoo link you provided and there are a few posts regarding atrial fibrillation and stiff heart disease.  Not sure what to make of them, but in general have heard mostly positive things in relation to the heart and fasting.  Have a look:

		<description><![CDATA[@Elizabeth Molin &quot;Perhaps we should also work every other day, instead of five days a week and then two days off…&quot;  

Exactly what I did back in 2011. 

I realised I couldn&#039;t handle spending all week at work, and I&#039;d also built up enough leave to take 2-3 months holiday. Instead of doing that, I asked my boss if I could just come in M-W-F, he agreed, and I tell you what everything just makes sense when you do it like that.

So yeah, picture this - every day that you go to work, you know you have a day off tomorrow. And when it&#039;s Friday - you get two!

As for eating, I do what I call Intermittent Feasting.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: When your &quot;only work MWF&quot; schedule stopped, what happened?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, do you suppose that there is any particular benefit to Alternate-Day-Fasting over other IF regimes like the 18:6? Do you know have any intuition for the dynamics of fasting (the longer you fast, the better results? or, is there any optimal time to for a fast? 24 hours? 18? 16?)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I suppose the longer you can fast without discomfort, the better. I can do alternate day fasting forever, it is pleasant rather than unpleasant. I used to eat one meal per day plus snacks. Plainly alternate day fasting is better.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Funny. The title of the show reminded me of the book about grammar by Lynne Truss:  &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves&quot;. I think that the show is &quot;Eat, Fast and Live Longer&quot; and not  &quot;Eat Fast and Live Longer&quot;. While reading the first paragraph I was trying to figure out why eating fast could be healthful... 

Thanks for the link. I&#039;ve been fasting about one day a week. Feels good.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I thought the title was a joke like that but I checked and you&#039;re right, there is a comma.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
