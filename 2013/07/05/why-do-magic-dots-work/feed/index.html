		<description><![CDATA[Is there an Android App which is a stopwatch that you can program to vibrate/make noise every six minutes?  That seems like it would be ideal and I&#039;d really like find one.  

You get the reinforcement if you&#039;re near were you can make the mark, but if you can&#039;t make a mark at the moment it keeps going so you still have your running total for when you can make the dots.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I use a free interval timer that I configure to automatically cycle through six-minute countdowns.  There is nothing to reset, except if you want to stop the cycling.  The app issues a short vibration at the end of each cycle.

		<description><![CDATA[I tried it last night. I had a letter to write. It worked well. My approach deviates from Conrad&#039;s. I use a six min countdown on my mobile phone. After six min an alarm rings. I make a dot or line then and set the countdown again. Pieces by pieces I approach the square with the cross. In the end, I had four of these figures and a letter to send.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Your letter took four hours?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, sorry if I&#039;m overthinking this, but I just can&#039;t figure out your exact &quot;magic dots&quot; methodology from your posts. Here&#039;s my best guess- Is this correct?

1. Set a timer that counts upward from zero.
2. As you&#039;re working, occasionally glance over to the timer
3. Whenever the timer has passed a new n*6-3 threshold, add &quot;dots&quot; until you reach &quot;n&quot; dots.
4. If you catch yourself NOT working, throw away the paper and reset the timer.

Do this example describe it correctly?

Example: Last time I glanced at the clock was at 60 minutes, which means there should be 10 marks on my paper (because 10*6-3=57). Then at the 64 minute mark I glance over at the clock and add the 11th mark (because 11*6-3=63). The next time I glance at the clock it&#039;s at 77 minutes. At this point n=13 (because 13*6-3=75) so I make TWO additional marks on the paper to get me up to the correct value for n.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, that&#039;s right. I changed a few words&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
