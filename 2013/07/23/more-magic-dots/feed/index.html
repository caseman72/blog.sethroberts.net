		<description><![CDATA[Nice.  To make it double-clickable on a Mac, however, I believe you should call it magic_dots.command rather than magic_dots.sh; double-clicking on that should open up a window which you can close to end the process. You ought to be able to make it stop with

killall magic_dots.command

which could also be in a double-clickable stop_dots.command file; haven&#039;t tried.

(On Ubuntu, where the &quot;say&quot; command does not exist, I will now use

    espeak -v en &quot;magic dot&quot; 

for an equivalent script, which does stop with &quot;killall&quot; -- thanks!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For a quick cheap OS X timer, put this in a file called magic_dots.sh

#!/bin/bash
# a script to say magic dot every 6 minuts, for ever.
for (( ; ; ))
do
   say &quot;magic dot&quot;
   sleep 360
done

Then type chmod 755 magic_dots.sh in the directory the file is in (or open it&#039;s properties and make it executable). Then at a terminal, type (or double click on it, I would think)

./magic_dots.sh &amp;

and your computer will say &quot;magic dot&quot; every 6 minutes.

To make it stop, close the terminal window it was run from. Or just leave the &amp; off, and close the terminal window. Worst case, reboot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had a very similar experience.  Visual graph type feedback doesn&#039;t really do much for me but magic dots work fairly well.  I found 6 minutes too short and changed the interval to 10 minutes so I now make magic triangles.  I started out trying to work an hour at a time but today I managed 2 hours.  I seem to be getting better at extending the time worked but... time will tell]]></description>
