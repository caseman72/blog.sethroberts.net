		<description><![CDATA[I have used this home Kit to test for total cholesterol, HDL and Triglycerides.

http://www.cardiochek.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=135&amp;Itemid=255

It works and results match up with the lab results. 

I don&#039;t use it to test blood glucose levels for that I have a different test kit from Bayers. I also use home A1C test kit from Bayers some times.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: At first I was excited by the existence of home A1C testing. Then I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/review/R1274T1GB88EI7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004N11OGQ&amp;nodeID=3760901&amp;store=hpc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is an interesting piece of self-experimentation and emphasizes how important it is to measure early, often and regularly. You already noted the futility of bringing down the cholesterol content - this is another aspect of self-experimentation: You need to measure outcomes that really do improve that what you want to improve (health in that case) and not some epidemiologically-linked number.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding the study you linked (bad effects of cholesterol lowering)...it seems that cholesterol was lowered in that study by means of medication.  The health outcomes might be very different if the same thing were achieved using an Esselstyn-type diet.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think it is not so simple. Let&#039;s say the medicine in that study has two effects: X and cholesterol-lowering. An Esselstyn-type diet has other effects: Y plus cholesterol-lowering. As far as I know, the medicine in that study does not have the bad effects (e.g., increased risk of suicide) unless your cholesterol is low. Which suggests that it has bad effects because it lowers cholesterol. So it is not obvious how an Esselstyn-type diet will affect suicide and other measures of mental health. Were Esselstyn to understand this and try to find the answer (&quot;what effect does my diet have on mental health?&quot;) I would respect him. As far as I know, he doesn&#039;t. The bad effects of cholesterol-lowering seen in that study and others he dismisses too easily.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
