		<description><![CDATA[1. I think 1 thing with the Fish Oil study is that they looked at 1 factor. Maybe they were pre-disposed to having more health problems which led them to take the fish oil. Also they didn&#039;t look at the quality or dosage of the supplements. 

2. Seth have you ever experimented with replacing flaxseed oil with fish oil?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Long ago I thought I would try fish oil in place of flaxseed oil but other things have kept getting in the way. The one time I tried fish oil it gave me a headache. I have some in my refrigerator now, however.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A bit off topic (although a bit related to dementia), but I haven&#039;t seen whether you&#039;ve expressed any views about the fish oil/prostate cancer study.  I&#039;ve been taking omega 3 supplements for some time (both for brain function and cankersores) and a number of people have advised me to stop as a result of the study. I am personally skeptical of the study, but was curious if you have any thoughts.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The study made me glad I take flaxseed oil rather than fish oil. It&#039;s epidemiology, usually a bit hard to interpret. I take flaxseed oil because of experimental data I gathered on myself -- much better evidence, if I want to know what&#039;s good for me.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Evelyn, I think that modern movies and TV shows are far more complicated than they used to be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
During its 44 minutes -- a real-time hour, minus 16 minutes for commercials -- the episode (of Fox TV show “24”) connects the lives of 21 distinct characters, each with a clearly defined &#039;&#039;story arc,&#039;&#039; as the Hollywood jargon has it: a defined personality with motivations and obstacles and specific relationships with other characters. Nine primary narrative threads wind their way through those 44 minutes, each drawing extensively upon events and information revealed in earlier episodes. Draw a map of all those intersecting plots and personalities, and you get structure that -- where formal complexity is concerned -- more closely resembles &#039;&#039;Middlemarch&#039;&#039; than a hit TV drama of years past like &#039;&#039;Bonanza.&#039;&#039;

For decades, we&#039;ve worked under the assumption that mass culture follows a path declining steadily toward lowest-common-denominator standards, presumably because the &#039;&#039;masses&#039;&#039; want dumb, simple pleasures and big media companies try to give the masses what they want. But as that &#039;&#039;24&#039;&#039; episode suggests, the exact opposite is happening: the culture is getting more cognitively demanding, not less. To make sense of an episode of &#039;&#039;24,&#039;&#039; you have to integrate far more information than you would have a few decades ago watching a comparable show. Beneath the violence and the ethnic stereotypes, another trend appears: to keep up with entertainment like &#039;&#039;24,&#039;&#039; you have to pay attention, make inferences, track shifting social relationships. This is what I call the Sleeper Curve: the most debased forms of mass diversion -- video games and violent television dramas and juvenile sitcoms -- turn out to be nutritional after all.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[As medical science doesn&#039;t know what to do about memory loss, even if physicians acknowledge it is occurring, there is no point in taking that problem to a physician.  This should be made common knowledge, just as people should be told that it is useless to visit a physician when you have a cold or the flu.

I can no longer keep up with story lines in modern films, but I think that is due to the poor quality of movie production and direction nowadays, not a loss in my own abilities.  If I watch a film I haven&#039;t seen before dating before the 1970s, I have no trouble whatsoever in following the plot.  Also, films in the &quot;good old days&quot; actually let you hear the dialogue - no music hindered the sound of speech, while nowadays dialogue in films is usually overshadowed by loud music and sound effects.  

I read somewhere that a good test for when a woman is losing her mental capabilities is whether she can still put a complicated meal together.  We have proper family dinners every week, and I am able to serve everything on time and cooked correctly, so I&#039;m not too worried about occasional lapses in remembering people&#039;s names!  First things first.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My 94 year old mother has always complained about not being able to remember things, although she remembers lots of things from her childhood. A few years ago she really started complaining and I even noticed she was a little more forgetful. So I took her off her statin meds and started feeding her butter - a pound a week. Her memory is back to where it was when she only thought she couldn&#039;t remember.

She is also in brighter spirits, more active and engaged.

		<description><![CDATA[I find myself struggling to remember familiar names.  Last week it was &quot;hollyhocks&quot;, this week it was - oh bugger, I can&#039;t remember.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The more you know the harder it will be to recall one thing correctly -- there is more interference from everything else you know. Increasing memory problems with age may or may not be due to memory decline.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
