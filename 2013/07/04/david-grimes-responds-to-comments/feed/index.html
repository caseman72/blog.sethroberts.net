		<description><![CDATA[Observations are real. Then follows conjecture, attempts to explain the observations based on knowledge that we have.
Protection by living at a high altitude in the USA requires explanation. Low partial pressure of oxygen has been suggested but does not make sense. Is the partial pressure of CO2 really greater at high altitude? My school physics makes this unlikely. Is there a plausible mechanism? Does it make sense? I suggest increased sunlight intensity on the basis o: parallels with latitude; UV light being known the cure tuberculosis; UV light and vitamin D enhancing immune mechanisms.

There is the recent observation that sunlight exposure has clinical benefit even when the blood level of vitsmin D does not change, hence the suggestion of a mechanism different from vitamin D. Nitric oxide is suggested but this is a very tentative suggestion and far from conclusive. The bottom line is that the sun is beneficial, but there might be mechanisms of benefit additional to vitamin D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
thanks for this post.  The altitude correlation is interesting.  This is something Ray Peat has written about.  He attributes the benefits of altitude to the higher concentration of CO2 in the air.  Here&#039;s a link:
http://raypeat.com/articles/aging/altitude-mortality.shtml
Ray writes extensively about the protective benefits of CO2.  His writings are worth a look, imo.

I came across something else interesting regarding the correlation between latitude and MS.  It&#039;s from Roy Swank, MD.  He treated MS with diet and believed that the latitude correlation resulted from those further from the equator consuming a more animal based diet and thereby more fat.  He recommends a low fat diet.
http://www.drmcdougall.com/res_swank.html

Food for thought. ;-)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: My guess is that radiation hormesis has a lot to do with better health at higher altitudes. There is more radiation at higher altitudes. The radiation activates repair systems.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is excellent stuff, Seth: keep going.

Here&#039;s my suggestion for someone&#039;s research topic: break down the British heart attack rates geographically not according to where people live now, but where they were born (or, even better if practical, where they lived until they were, say, 18). 

My idea is that if heart attacks depend on some unidentified microorganism you might well pick it up at an early age, long before you are vulnerable to a heart attack.  This might be worth doing too for other diseases e.g. M.S.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks! There is a lot of evidence for something happening at a young age, perhaps in the womb, that affects your health much later. The book &lt;em&gt;Mothers, Babies and Health in Later Life&lt;/em&gt; by Barker has many examples. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
