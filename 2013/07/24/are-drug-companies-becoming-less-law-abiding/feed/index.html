		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  These revelations are not new.  It is becoming common knowledge that drug development and testing has for years been characterized by conflicts of interest and outright corruption.  Marketing practices are particularly egregious. 

Regulation of the industry is weak to the point of scandal because of long-standing regulatory capture at least as bad as what has occurred in the banking industry.  We have essentially the same problem in the broader medical care industry in the USA.  The problems are unlikely to be resolved until a way is found to eliminate, or at least temper, the profit motive in these industries.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sheesh, this pattern suggests that the fines aren&#039;t really being issued... Only 9fines over 4 years for fraudulent marketing implies to me that their definition of fraudulent is pretty damn weak.  &quot;Demonstrated to be safe&quot; is fraudulent in all cases.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t know if these are all the fines. I think they are all the giant fines.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
