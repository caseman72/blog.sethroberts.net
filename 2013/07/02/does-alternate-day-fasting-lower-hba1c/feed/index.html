		<description><![CDATA[Seth, when doing alternate day fasting, how do you continue eating flax seeds/oil and butter if you&#039;re fasting every other day?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I eat them on the fasting days. If you look at alternate-day fasting protocols, they usually include 500 calories or so on the fasting days.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought that was a bit curious too. In the end of 2006/beginning of 2007 your HbA1c dropped more than 1 point. What was the interval between those 2 readings &amp; what did you do during that time?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The interval was 3.5 months. I can&#039;t remember what I did but probably reduced my high-GI carb intake. The early years of these readings are the first years the service was offered. I was surprised by the high values and probably changed what I ate, but it is also possible that the measurement method improved (e.g., the calibration improved).&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If the green dots are your previous level, they show high variability as well as sudden, precipitous drops.

Your current results don&#039;t support anything.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Time will tell.
&lt;/strong&gt;
