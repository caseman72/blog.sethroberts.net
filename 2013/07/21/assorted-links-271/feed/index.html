		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Naked and Afraid&quot; is an awesome show. Miles above the spate of other survivalist shows.  Sheer genius, makes me want to learn how to start a fire and make shoes from tree bark and find a woman who can chase down and kill an eel with a club. The show is about more than surviving in a wilderness though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is some evidence that spraying with DDT is the best solution to the malaria problem in Africa.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As malaria surges once again in Africa, victories are few. But South Africa is beating the disease with a simple remedy: spraying the inside walls of houses in affected regions once a year. Several insecticides can be used, but South Africa has chosen the most effective one. It lasts twice as long as the alternatives. It repels mosquitoes in addition to killing them, which delays the onset of pesticide-resistance. It costs a quarter as much as the next cheapest insecticide. It is DDT.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
