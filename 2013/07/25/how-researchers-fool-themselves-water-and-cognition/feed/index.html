		<description><![CDATA[&gt; A better analysis would have started by assuming that the 14 measures are unlikely to be independent. It would have done (or used) a factor analysis that condensed the 14 measures into (say) three factors. Then the researchers could ask if water affected each of the three factors. Far fewer tests, far more independent tests, far harder to fool yourself or cherry-pick.

Where would these 3 factors come from? If they&#039;re being estimated from the data, without any previous reason to expect particular factorization, and then fed into the tests with the expectation we have reduced our false positive problem, that makes me feel uneasy and wonder how kosher this procedure really is.

Incidentally, as far as the Man-Whitney goes, I&#039;ve used it twice recently when I wanted to compare 2 groups but they were blatantly not normally-distributed (in http://www.gwern.net/Google%20Alerts#it-was-mid-2011 and http://www.gwern.net/Anchoring#article-effect). Normality is common, sure, but so is non-normality; if one never feels the need to use it, perhaps one is simply shoehorning t-tests where they don&#039;t belong.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Check out &quot;data transformation&quot; (e.g., log transformation) the next time you encounter non-normal data.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Three Pipe Problem, that&#039;s a good question. I&#039;d like to run simple experiments and test for significance. I studied psychology and had courses in statistics. I don&#039;t remember much. I&#039;d like to fresh up basic concepts in a playful style: Self experimentation 101 with suggested experiments (week one eat 60g butter daily, week two don&#039;t, week three like week one again and so on and test reaction time or whatever concept daily, or connection amount of coffee consumed and self-measured sleep quality, or sleep quality and seeing people in the evening). Stuff gets so much more interesting if it has real life value.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Completely agree that replication is key (in experimental studies, that is... Replication is a less reliable tool in non-randomised studies because bias is systematic), and is a much more important consideration than multiple testing.  Any &quot;significant&quot; result might be a type 1 error, and a p-value doesn&#039;t give any indication how likely that might be.  Replication is the only way to rule that out (which is why FDA typically requires at least 2 phase 3 trials).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think a better and, to my mind, more convincing approach, is to require replication. Finding the same effect in two independent samples is pretty powerful. Controls for multiple comparisons are a mixed bag, and some of them can really be too strict. Multiple-experiment papers, which are the norm in most cognitive psychology journals, typically include a replication as part of later experiments, and I find that to be more convincing than statistical controls for multiple comparisons. Of course, neither control for other issues such as non-representative of stimuli or subjects, but such is live in this vale of tears.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The first person not to fool is yourself -- preferably without the enormous cost of repeating the experiment. You don&#039;t seem to be taking the cost of replication into account. Or maybe you are thinking like a reader rather than as a practitioner. If you have two or three independent tests, the adjustments for multiple comparisons are realistic. You really can set the overall p value to 0.05. Sure, replication is a good idea, too. In multiple experiment papers, nothing is said about experiments that didn&#039;t work out -- there is no statement like &quot;we are not omitting relevant evidence&quot; -- so it is less than obvious what repetition means. Of course, when authors omit relevant evidence they are deceiving others, not themselves. What&#039;s interesting about this example is that the researchers appear to have deceived themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[KS is to MW as is sameness of distribution is to sameness of means.

KS is very handy in my line of work, MW not so much.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: KS is much less sensitive than other tests.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my (limited) experience, even people who claim to be experts in statistics often don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about. I remember working on a paper back in graduate school.  The lead author was trying to determine whether to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Mann-Whitney test, or something else altogether.  The people we consulted did not exactly fill us with confidence in their abilities.  (Of course, maybe we just asked the wrong people.)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I have never used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test nor the Mann-Whitney test and expect never to do so. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
