  This suggests eating fruit first (which is what they do in Latin America), carbs second, i.e., potatoes etc,  vegetables next and then protein last.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you think it&#039;s possible for the quality of sleep to be affected by something even earlier, maybe a few days or more?  It might take a longer for some food or environmental factors to work their way through the system.  Of course, factors that are closer in time could be assumed to be stronger influences, and would be a logical place to begin, but it seems too simplistic to say it&#039;s either what you ate yesterday or random noise.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: By &quot;random noise&quot; I meant everything else. As for your hypothesis (&quot;the quality of sleep is affected by something even earlier&quot;), I agree. There is jet lag, which takes several days to recover from. The bad effects of breakfast took me a week or so to recover from.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth! I would love to try and replicate your results. I found that what I eat for breakfast and lunch has a strong effect on my sleep with or without honey (if I eat too much carbs before PM I sleep badly, but if too little I get anxious and also sleep badly)

Could you please share what you ate for breakfast and lunch on these days? thank you.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No breakfast. Lunch: 60 g butter, 20 g cheese, small amount of pork or duck, 30 g ground flaxseed, 18 g dark chocolate, yogurt, fruit, tea with honey and cream as desired.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think your research is pointing in the direction that some ice cream after dinner is ideal. It has lots of cream, so could probably substitute for some of the butter you normally consume, and has a decent amount of sugar, possibly comparable to a tablespoon of honey?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s an interesting idea. However, the fat in the ice cream might interfere with the digestion of the sugar. Ice cream has a surprisingly low glycemic index. I once had honey and cheese at bedtime, instead of just honey. The results were worse than usual, presumably because the cheese slowed down digestion of the honey. I agree it&#039;s worth trying sugar in different contexts.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
