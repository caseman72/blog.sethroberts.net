		<description><![CDATA[Re: seafood vs. flaxseed, there is a third option for omega-3. It turns out that hens fed a high-flaxseed diet lay eggs with much higher amounts of EPA and DHA. Given the importance of omega-3 for brain development, it makes sense that the yolk should accumulate a disproportionate amount of the converted long-chain omega-3s. (The brand I&#039;m familiar with, &quot;Christopher Eggs&quot; from Kroger/Private Selection, have 660 mg omega-3 per egg.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mixing cocoa powder and water would make a drink much less fatty than what the Kuna consume.  Try adding back cocoa butter? ...or something with baking/dark chocolate?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good point. However, I already eat a lot of butter.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my family problems with sea-food are highly specific - for example, one can&#039;t eat crab but is OK with everything else.  Another can&#039;t eat lobster, at least of the North Atlantic variety, but can eat crab, Australian species, and so on.

I&#039;ve never met anyone who can&#039;t eat white fish, salmon, trout, herring, sardines, mackerel and the other common culinary fish, though I don&#039;t doubt that they might exist.  Shellfish: yes, I&#039;ve heard of that problem.  But does  allergy to shellfish imply allergy to, say, cod, haddock, sole, plaice â€¦.?

I ask from pure ignorance, not as a debating point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hap,

In response to the Kuma Indians info, which suggests great health benefits of nearly raw cacao, I have gotten some Cocoavia products, which are supposed to be high in flavonols. You have to process the cocao &quot;gently&quot; to not destroy them. Maybe I will compare the Cocoavia stuff to the Andronico&#039;s powder you mention.]]></description>
