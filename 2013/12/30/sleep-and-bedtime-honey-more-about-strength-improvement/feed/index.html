		<description><![CDATA[This makes sense: the honey is causing either an insulin spike or a rise in basal insulin. In either case, your insulin is rising. Insulin, aside from being a storage hormone (i.e. causes sugar to be stored as fat) also causes muscle growth. 

The previous two posts make sense in this light. Bodybuilders often take carbs immediately before and/or after a workout for this reason, before or after depending on their philosophy--turns out that an insulin spike will stop HGH secretion after a workout, so this is a potential problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interestingly, I have a weight lifting book from the mid-1980&#039;s that claims to be based on Bulgarian olympic lifter training. They recommend consuming a teaspoon of honey about 10 minutes before each exercise session and a protein source between 30-180 minutes afterward.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, this reminds me of a technique called &quot;carbo backloading&quot;. The basic idea is that you can gain muscle by (1) exercising later in the day (e.g. after 3 pm) and (2) eating simple carbohydrates (e.g. honey, but I don&#039;t remember anyone discussing honey specifically with regard to the procedure) during the 3 hour window after exercising. Not sure if these are related (and I guess there is considerable debate about whether carbo backloading works) but I wonder if there might be a connection to your findings re: honey and strength gains.]]></description>
