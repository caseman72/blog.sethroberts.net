		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jackye--  The fingernails were fixed by stomach acid supplements (HCL with pepsin). My doctor told me that low stomach acid is common with autoimmune thyroid issues. So I did a self-test to figure out the dose size I needed, and about four months after I started supplementing, my fingernails stopped peeling. My theory is that without stomach acid, I wasn&#039;t breaking down my food well and so I wasn&#039;t using all the nutrients I took in. I have to wonder about the positive effects on the parts of my body I can&#039;t see.

Incidentally, my nails peeled continuously from age 13 to last January (age 39), with only two breaks: once when I took biotin supplements (when I stopped, it came back) and during the year I drank a ton of raw milk. 

And Alex: Thanks very much! I&#039;ve been a blog lurker since 2001, but haven&#039;t commented much or blogged myself. Maybe that will change as my health improves....one of my major symptoms is a failure to connect intent to action. So I would read blogs and intend to comment, but never do it, or intend to start a blog, but never post. Now that my health is improving, I find I have a shorter list of things I mean to do and longer list of things I&#039;m actually doing. So you never know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great observations and impressive results, Kirsten Marcum. If you ever blog about the process, I&#039;d love to read it.

I&#039;m most envious of your having found your doctor. When I told my GP I&#039;d lost 30 pounds by eating paleo, she all but rolled her eyes. I&#039;d love to know how many other patients she has who&#039;ve dropped over 10% of body weight in months without any exercise or calorie restriction.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The one that most resonated with me is #2.

I&#039;m always amazed by the number of people that seem to shrug and assume sub-optimal health is part of life. No, it means you&#039;re doing something WRONG THAT NEEDS FIXED! Your job is to pay close attention to try and figure it out.

When genetic pre-disposition for one ailment after another was newly the rage (which, I guess it still is), the counter joke was &quot;Hey, our genes didn&#039;t evolve to kill us.&quot; I think too many people think misery is just bad luck and there&#039;s nothing one can do about it. It&#039;s Shakespearean. Or Biblical. One is born under a crossed star, or a pox is on one&#039;s house, and &#039;dems da&#039; breaks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ok, on stomach issues.  my stomach is more or less fine, but i have a friend who has a lot of &quot;random&quot; stomach issues.  i don&#039;t think she&#039;s going to do the &quot;experimentation&quot; thing much herself but is there anything i should suggest she read or anyone she should see?  ie where should she start?  i know what i would do, read a ton of stuff and try some things and keep track, but it&#039;s not me.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Read what I&#039;ve written about fermented foods.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
