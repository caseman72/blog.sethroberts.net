		<description><![CDATA[I became a great cynic about modern medicine when I read about the statin trials when 15% (if my imperfect memory serves) of the treated group gave up in the first couple of weeks, and were thereafter just quietly expunged from the stats.  Presumably - but we&#039;ll never know - they gave up because they already were suffering from adverse side-effects.  That meant that all predictions of the proportion of the population who would so suffer were effectively lies.  It also meant that the most interesting proportion of the subjects of the experiment were deleted.  After all, those who gain by statins - insofar as they exist - are just statistical facts, but people who suffer are actual, identifiable humans, to whom one could apply, if I dare use the word, science.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How much missing data is there for home remedies circulated on blogs like this one? If 100 people decide to try out honey before bedtime, what percent will report back and be included in a post? Does the answer look closer to &#039;0 or 1%&#039; or &#039;99 or 100%&#039;?]]></description>
