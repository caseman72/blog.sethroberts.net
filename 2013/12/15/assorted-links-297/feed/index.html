		<description><![CDATA[The shampoo treatment was mentioned at the website of a university professor in San Diego, as far back as 2008.  I found it then during a desperate search to resolve my own incapacitating sinusitis.

In less than a week of shampooing, a six-month headache was gone.  It recurred occasionally until I fixed environmental causes.  Tried many things, but the two that mattered were to replace the household carpet and to vacuum my mattress every couple of weeks.

Couple of years later, my sense of smell returned.  When you regain a sense you thought was lost forever, you appreciate even the stinkiest odors!

Sinusitis treatment in the U.S. is doubly silly.  First, nearly all chronic sinusitis is fungal (says Mayo Clinic in 1999), yet antibiotics are universally prescribed, obviously with no effect on the primary infection.  Second, no one ever tackles environmental causes.

To Seth&#039;s point, though, developing a more discriminating immune system might be an even better solution.  But the above worked for me.

Final note to Southern California readers:  you might notice a link between your sinusitis and  seasonal &quot;Santa Ana&quot; winds, which blow dust westward off the deserts every November and December.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will knows that it is theoretically &quot;possible to have a different much lower minimum wage for teenagers.&quot;  He has observed several attempts to legislate somewhat lower minimum wages for teenagers.  Several unsuccessful attempts.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Michigan and Australia are examples of what I am talking about -- a lower minimum wage for teenagers than adults. The Australia minimum wage for adults is especially high so I don&#039;t understand why Australia is irrelevant. Had Will argued that it doesn&#039;t work in Australia, that would have been more persuasive.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth
I find the discussion about minimum wage similar to discussions about foreign aid.  It is assumed to be obviously positive and the thought that it might have a larger negative affect isn&#039;t considered.   I would compare it to antibiotic prescriptions for acne from your doctor.  It is assumed that it works because that is what we are told but antibiotic use actually made you less well off. 

Although you could run an experiment on acne and antibiotics it is impossible for us to do that for minimum wage but the following real world example is interesting. 

The following is from the economist Scott Sumner.

Regarding minimum wage,* here is some data for Western Europe:

There are nine countries with a minimum wage (Belgium, Netherlands, Britain, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Luxembourg).  Their unemployment rates range from 5.9% in Luxembourg to 27.6% in Greece.  The median country is France with 11.1% unemployment.

There are nine countries with no minimum wage (Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland.)  Five of the nine have a lower unemployment rate than Luxembourg, the best of the other group.  The median country is Iceland, with a 5.5% unemployment rate. 
The biggest country in Europe is Germany.  No minimum wage and 5.2% unemployment.
Still want to raise our minimum wage to $10?  Germany used to have really high unemployment.  Then they did labor reforms to allow more low wage jobs, combined with subsidies for low wage workers.  Now they don’t have high unemployment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Minimum-Wage is an eternal ideal for the left &amp; Ron Unz -- an ideological dogma immune to facts.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: George Will needs a better grasp of history, such as the Hammurabi Code and the Ten Commandments, both of which promise to protect the weak from the powerful. It is perfectly possible to have a different much lower minimum wage for teenagers. Will apparently doesn&#039;t know this, either. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The breath test was a coincidence...didn&#039;t get enough measurements to mean much. Ignore the breath test. 

I don&#039;t learn much from the hair tests, perhaps because they are infrequent.

The reaction-time test I do daily showed that there was no bad effects of the removals.

I don&#039;t know anything about the Quicksilver Scientific test, sorry. If I was really concerned, I would get two (not one) tests before and two (not one) tests after. Otherwise you cannot separate noise from signal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, it&#039;s my understanding from Joseph Mercola, etc., that—for some people—the removal of the amalgam fillings might cause even worse problems than leaving them in, with the severity depending on how effective the patient&#039;s body is at eliminating the mercury that is inevitably inhaled or swallowed during amalgam removal.

Because my amalgams are breaking down after 25-30 years, I am going to have 10 of them removed in 2014. I was thinking about doing a Quicksilver Scientific &quot;Tri-test&quot; (separate analysis of methyl mercury and inorganic mercury in hair, blood and urine) before and after the first extractions, to see how my body is eliminating the mercury.

I recall that you opted for hair and breath tests of your mercury levels. Do you have an opinion as to whether such multi-layered testing as the above-mentioned Quicksilver Scientific&#039;s is overkill?]]></description>
