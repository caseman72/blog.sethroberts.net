		<description><![CDATA[Pain encouraged the risk taking to do what they did, freedom, cash and stability allowed them the ability to execute.  The benefit to Snowden seemed ideological at the time - mainly the personal satisfaction of whistleblowing where he perceived wrongdoing by the government - rather than a thought of the financial gain.

However, none of what the pair did is new ground.  Confiding in a reporter seems to be a relatively proven way to whistleblow, and reporting the news is not novel for Greenwald.  Seeking asylum also already invented - not sure Snowden could patent his method across the whole experience given most of this is in the common domain.

I like your framework, but in this case it&#039;s more an evaluation of motivation to engage in potentially risky behavior for those involved rather than innovation.  Perhaps we have different understandings of innovation?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Greenwald is nothing like a typical reporter. Except he is paid. Snowden exposed classified documents on a scale that dwarfs anything that came before. But you are right, motivation is a huge part of innovation. So is risk-taking. Of course the term innovation is usually reserved for conventional economic products, such as cars or toothbrushes or services we buy. But the whole point of those products and services is to improve our lives. That is also the point of what Snowden and Greenwald are doing. If you consider the assembly line an innovation -- and everyone does -- you must realize it merely increased the number of cars. What Snowden and Greenwald are doing/have done is increase the amount of classified info the rest of us know about.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Snowden could be said to have innovated getting away (so far) with whistle-blowing, but I&#039;m not sure whether his methods scale.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: They scale in the sense that everyone now knows the information he wanted known. There is no need for a million people people (or even one more person) to do what he did.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Struggling to see the way in which Snowden and Greenwald innovated.  Can you help?  Rebelled against authority, yes, but innovated less so.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Snowden die something highly original and effective. Greenwald at least took a thoughtful position against the status quo. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Not because they want to, it has been forced on them.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. Indeed, this is the problem with the insular and, as often as not, outright nepotistic elite from the Ivy League that&#039;s taken over Finance, Govt, and MSM. They are too comfortable with the status quo, and have too much to lose if it is adjusted in the slightest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, a fair chunk of the innovation caused by government restrictions is ways of dealing with the restrictions. 

Figuring out a clever way for tax accountants to be more efficient would probably be a sensible project in the world as it is, but that cleverness might find better uses in a world with simpler taxes.

Idea developed from Howard Ruff, who pointed out the huge cognitive load on a culture from a complex tax code.
