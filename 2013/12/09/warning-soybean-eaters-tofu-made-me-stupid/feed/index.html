		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seth: Interesting, thanks. I wonder how well people sleep on a macrobiotic diet.&quot;

I didn&#039;t note any significant effect on sleep while following a macrobiotic diet.

However, I did begin to sleep better on an LC/Paleo diet, and on Dr. Kruse&#039;s Leptin Reset diet; the latter emphasizes no food after about 6:00 PM. When combined with exercise in the late afternoon (anaerobic; not cardio), sleep becomes deep and restful. The most profound effect on sleep that I&#039;ve noticed in my N=1 experimentation was achieved by wearing blue-blockers after sunset, especially if using a computer in the evening. Wearing the blue-blockers also seems to have a pronounced effect on waking blood sugar. Wearing blue blockers also seems to elevate my mood (I am, after all, seeing the world through rose-colored glasses).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post!

&quot;every expert said sugar was fattening, I found it caused me to lose weight&quot;

Just wondering if you have a post on your experience on this, I&#039;d be very interested, thank you.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. See my book, The Shangri-La Diet.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seth: That’s very interesting. Given how bad a macrobiotic diet actually is, why did some diet guru decide that such an unhealthy diet was so great?&quot;

It was a series of gurus, starting in the 50s. If you look at the macrobiotic diet as basically a traditional Japanese peasant diet, it makes sense and I believe it to be healthy; i.e. it makes sense if you maintain a state of semi-starvation, constant exercise, and no modern junk foods, none of which are at all common among modern American practitioners of macrobiotics. 

Many have used a macrobiotic diet to treat serious, advanced disease. There is far too much anecdotal to dismiss macrobiotics. Also, the macrobiotic diet is certainly better than the SAD. Modern macrobiotics has made some unfortunate mistakes, however, like treating all grains as equal, treating soy as a kind of health food, ignoring gluten sensitivity, etc.

I remember reading a passage somewhere in &quot;Good Calories, Bad Calories&quot; about blood triglycerides becoming visible in a vial of blood, but not visible if in a state of semi-starvation. That fascinated me, and I immediately thought of my experience with macrobiotics and the constant teaching that semi-starvation was something to aspire to.

		<description><![CDATA[Here are some observations from a long-term N=1 experiment: 

I used to eat a strict macrobiotic diet consisting of brown rice, vegetables (mostly brassica), beans, seaweed, and relatively high proportions of soy (tofu, tempeh, miso, soy sauce), nut butters, as well as occasional artificial garbage like &quot;Nayanoise&quot; and &quot;Rice Dream&quot;. I did this for years. 

At first, I experienced weight loss. Eventually (about 3 years later), I noticed that I often had mood swings (no doubt caused by blood sugar changes), cravings, and low energy. I had what today I call &quot;brain fog&quot; most of the time, and difficulty concentrating. Most interestingly, I noticed that I had an increasing tendency to be more sensitive and emotional rather than rational. I attribute this to phytoestrogens in the soy. I believe the effect is quite real and measurable, although the change was gradual. I also had a tendency to feel cold all of the time (probably caused by inhibition of thyroid by brassica and autoimmune thyroid disease cased by gluten). 

After about 12 years of this, I gradually changed my diet to LC/Paleo, by first getting rid of the soy, then the rice and beans, then the seed oils and incorporating fish, meat, eggs, dairy, coconut oil, etc. My energy level is now far higher, my blood sugar is normal and stable, and the brain fog has cleared up. I have a far easier time concentrating. Finally, I went strictly gluten-free. That made a tremendous difference.

I now think that in many ways the macrobiotic diet (as practiced in the early- to mid-90s) is about the worst diet one can possibly consume. It is extremely pro-inflamatory, incorporates all the wrong kinds of fats, high in gluten and free glutamate, and prone to cause blood sugar swings (observe any macrobiot and you will see that many of them can&#039;t stop eating carbs). I think that the only conditions in which macrobiotics makes any sense at all is if one is in a state of metabolic semi-starvation.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s very interesting. Given how bad a macrobiotic diet actually is, why did some diet guru decide that such an unhealthy diet was so great?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this very interesting finding. I&#039;m a string believer in the effects of food on our (imediate) well-being and a health geek. I&#039;m especially fond of your rigurous self-testing. (I&#039;d love a link to the software you use by the way).

But I wondered if you could enhance your self-experiment to prevent a placebo-effect. Since you might have read all those articles about tofu being not good fo your health, there is a possibility that your unconciousness might slow you down during the tests, just to make sure you&#039;re right.

So you would need not not know in advance, if you&#039;re eating tofu or not. In addition you might want to make it double blind. So when you&#039;re eating it, the person/the cook doesn&#039;t know what you&#039;re eating either.

I thought about cooking up maybe five different dishes, so heavily spiced for example that you can&#039;t taste if it&#039;s tofu or something else. Then somebody packs them for you in boxes labeled with numbers. Which is which, you can&#039;t know. Then you eat on of those every day, and later check if it really was the tofu all by itself.

It is certainly i bit overengineering, but might be worthwhile to make sure, we&#039;re not fooling ourselfs.

Thanks again and all the best

Nico

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I had forgotten about one of the epidemiology articles when I did the test. The other one I never knew about. The food I tested here I ate for years. One day my score was surprisingly low and the only unusual thing about that day is that I had eaten the tofu. That&#039;s why I did this test. None of this supports the explanation you propose.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not an expert on the topic, just a well-read and heavily researching self-experimenter.

1.
The estrogenic effects of soy kick off a chain reaction slowing down the ways the brain is being &quot;fueled&quot;, which results in fogginess. Phytoestrogens are quite controversial and as far as I know allowed in the US, but if you want to feed it to your baby in Germany for example, you need a prescription. If you mess negatively with the dominant sex hormone of each sex, you do no good.
There&#039;s no heavy research on it, but as a self-experimenter you can do the following: do your self-reaction test, but instead of eating soy beforehand like you described above, eat some brazil nuts. Those are the most potent natural source of testosterone equivalents. I did that and it sharpened my thinking tremendously. I guarantee you will find similar results.

<p>1.<br />
The estrogenic effects of soy kick off a chain reaction slowing down the ways the brain is being &#8220;fueled&#8221;, which results in fogginess. Phytoestrogens are quite controversial and as far as I know allowed in the US, but if you want to feed it to your baby in Germany for example, you need a prescription. If you mess negatively with the dominant sex hormone of each sex, you do no good.<br />
There&#8217;s no heavy research on it, but as a self-experimenter you can do the following: do your self-reaction test, but instead of eating soy beforehand like you described above, eat some brazil nuts. Those are the most potent natural source of testosterone equivalents. I did that and it sharpened my thinking tremendously. I guarantee you will find similar results.</p>

That&#039;s an interesting explanation. I have two questions: 1. Why should estrogens cause brain dysfunction? 2. What other foods are as estrogenic as soy?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your findings are absolutely correct. Within the paleo community it&#039;s no secret that soy creates brain-fog.

Here&#039;s the missing element: Soy is estrogenic.

Which means it acts as some weird estrogene surrogate in your body and messes with your hormonal balance.

Men can feel impacts quicker than women, because of naturally higher testosterone levels. But the long term effects for women are worse. The little testosterone women have gets basically wiped out. It can&#039;t counteract the natural estrogene levels AND soy estrogenes on top.
That&#039;s why soy-rich vegetarianism is the most common road to breast cancer. At least become a pescetarian and avoid soy like the plague.

Dave Asprey from www.bulletproofexec.com has been negatively addressing soy and its effects for years. Check out his research. He&#039;s a very innovative thinker similar to you.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, 

This sounds really interesting.  I would love to do the experiment. I would really appreciate it if you could send me the software. 

Thank you!
