i was wondering what the theorised &#039;mechanism&#039; for #2 might be...
the only think i could think of was something to do with liver glycogen,

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

in regards to taking honey before bed being effective...in a comment under a prev post you wrote*...
&quot;Two things seem to matter. 1. You must take it on an empty stomach. 2. You must not have sweets during the day&quot;

do you still think &#039;rule&#039; #2 applies? &amp; if so why do you think that may be?

*ref: http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/20/bedtime-honey-improves-sleep-1000-crazy-good-tip/#comment-1156678

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think #2 applies -- you can&#039;t eat a lot of sweets, a few sweets make no difference -- because it would raise your insulin levels. If your insulin is too high for too long it will remove sugar from your blood at night.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You wrote earlier that the total amount of sugar you consume these past few (including post-dinner and pre-bed) is about 95g. 

Some people write that they experience less of the effect of honey when they eat many non-sugary carbs throughout the day. Do you know what is the total daily number of no- sugary carbs you get these days from food (flax, starchy vegetables, etc)?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Daily &quot;number&quot;? You mean number of servings? I eat 30 g ground flax per day. Maybe 1 serving of non-sweet carbs. Not much.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[
Seth - you mentioned trying blueberries and now bananas. I wonder if some fruits are more optimal than others ? 

Here are a couple more studies regarding fruit - juice in this case - and sleep  ( in case you haven&#039;t come across them already).

These are a little different in that in one, time of taking the juice does not seem to be controlled, in the other one serving is taken 1-2 hrs before sleep.

1) Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia: A Pilot Study
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3133468/

2) Effect of tart cherry juice (Prunus cerasus) on melatonin levels and enhanced sleep quality.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22038497

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: In the second study the two conditions are equated for sugar content.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I always find your blog fascinating and informational. Along those lines I wondered if you have played with resistant starch as a food source for our microbiome? There is a lot of N=1 testing going on the FreeTheAnimal blog and the results are encouraging as a methodology to control blood sugars etc.

		<description><![CDATA[I was curious to see what research had been done with fruit before bed and sleep, and found this paper : http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/20/2/169.pdf ( Effect of kiwifruit consumption on sleep quality in adults with sleep problems ).

In the study eating 2 medium kiwi fruits an hour before sleep, helped the subjects sleep better.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, yes, I knew about that study. You are right I should give it more emphasis. It could have gone the other way (the kiwis made sleep worse) so it supports what I am saying. Two kiwi weigh about 100 g, which would contain about 4 g glucose and 4 g fructose. Not so far from the dosages that I found have worked.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of Kiefer (athlete.io).  His focus is mainly for bodybuilders, though I think his first book was for people looking to lose weight.  
His understanding of hormonal activity throughout the day, and his subsequent recommendations as to when to eat carbs and what type to eat coincides with yours.  Now, you are eating a lot fewer carbs and eating them everyday, while Kiefer protocols are to eat a lot after training, and be low carb the rest of the time, but I think you are both tapping into the same daily hormonal cycle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your blog, Seth.  Merry Christmas!

I love the discoveries here, because they are inexpensive and range from easy to pleasurable. 

Lots of tasty things can be made with just fruit and sugar, why eat plain bananas and straight honey??

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: to keep things simple. Simplicity will help me increase my understanding. It is much easier to know what is in a banana or honey than what is in an ordinary dessert.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Merry Christmas to you, too, Seth!

I’ve been sleeping better since adding sweets at night, similar to what you describe.

At first I was resistant to the idea of sweets before bed because:

1) I had been not eating after 7 or 8pm as part of an intermittent fasting condensed eating window eating routine 
2) I have historically overeaten refined sweets

Recently, though, I’ve been doing it, having some fruit (or sweets with the Holidays) around bedtime and have been sleeping much better. I would say my rested percent had gone from 90 to 95–98, and I’ve been getting up about an hour earlier. Definitely much better.  

When I started reading this below before low blue light at night, Vitamin D in the morning, and the above my rested percent was more like 30–40%.

I’ve also recently (2 months ago) installed blackout curtains and found that my sleep got, to my surprise slightly worse. I have 4 windows in my bedroom, and leaving one of the curtains partially open so some light can get in (there is a lot on my street) seems better than almost no light.

Thanks, Seth!]]></description>
