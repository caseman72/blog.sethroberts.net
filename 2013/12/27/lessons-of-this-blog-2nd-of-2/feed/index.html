		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not suggesting that health professionals who work on their own problems will necessarily find solutions. You spent a long time working on your problems before anything useful turned up.

However, I would expect that a health professional working on their own or a loved one&#039;s problem is much less likely to publicize a solution which doesn&#039;t work or has such severe side effects that it&#039;s not worth using. There&#039;s still the possibility that a solution which works for the health professional doesn&#039;t apply to at least some people with similar problems, of course.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Experts, often for professional reasons, are not allowed to draw from disparate fields to make important connections and findings.&quot;

I haven&#039;t noticed that. It&#039;s true enough that they might not be curious about other fields. At Berkeley, in my experience, few faculty attended talks outside their field, but nothing prevented  or discouraged them from doing so. I attended lots of talks in different fields. Nothing bad happened.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe another advantage that non experts have is that they are allowed to be generalists. They are able to make connections across different areas and disciplines, which is often how innovation and creativity comes about. They aren&#039;t fenced in like experts.

		<description><![CDATA[Terry Wahls-- http://www.terrywahls.com/-- a doctor with serious MS who developed a modified paleo diet which controls her symptoms and which has worked for other people with MS. (It doesn&#039;t seem to work for some other people with degenerative diseases, which at least suggests that people in general aren&#039;t completely ruled by confirmation bias.)

		<description><![CDATA[Not only do non-experts not have pressure to toe the party line, they are also free to find solutions to problems that are non-patentable.  There is a reason that doctors prescribe Boniva instead of prunes and Ambien instead of honey, even though the prunes and the honey are effective, cheaper and have no harmful side-effects.

I recently read Manufacturing Depression by Gary Greenburg and highly recommend it.  Psychiatrists are uninterested in treatment that does not use drugs.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree. I would put it a bit differently. Non-experts are free to find solutions that do not provide income to health care professionals. A naturopath, for example, will rarely advise something they don&#039;t sell. Lots of what they sell isn&#039;t patentable.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2013/07/31/european-heart-guidelines-based-on-disgraced-research-may-have-caused-thousands-of-deaths/

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: good example. what&#039;s so telling about it is that it wasn&#039;t just one expert, one &quot;rotten apple&quot;. Many experts (all European doctors?) followed recommendations based on bad data.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some experts are researching their own diseases or diseases of loved ones-- it might be a good idea to take those experts more seriously.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You&#039;d think so, wouldn&#039;t you? But in my experience these experts don&#039;t do well. I can think of three examples: 1. Stanford molecular biologist who discovered he had diabetes. He cured it via exercise. Nothing special there, in spite of a lot of high-tech measurements. He noticed the diabetes the same way everyone else does, with blood sugar measurements. 2. Geneticist near Stanford whose daughter has a very rare genetic disease. Last time I checked, he had made no progress in reducing her symptoms. 3. Larry Smarr, who has Crohn&#039;s. No progress on reducing the symptoms of Crohn&#039;s, last time I checked. 

Do you know of other examples?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
