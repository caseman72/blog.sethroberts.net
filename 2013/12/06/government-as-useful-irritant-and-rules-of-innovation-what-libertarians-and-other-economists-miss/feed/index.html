&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Skateboards are a major innovation? I disagree. Who invented the three-axis aircraft controller? Speaking of skateboards, I do know that the mountain bike came from the elite and powerful. It was invented by the brother of one of my classmates.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, if you were appointed &quot;Czar of Useful Irritants&quot; do you believe you could increase the rate/degree of innovation in the United States?
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: No I don&#039;t think this theory of mine is ready to be used as the basis for public policy. Better to be used to guide research. For example, compare theory to practice, where innovations come from. To increase innovation in the United States, I would make life easier for small businesses. Some regulations are useful irritants, plenty of others serve to crush small businesses. I agree with that aspect of libertarianism.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth says: &quot;Blinded by what ideology? Care to offer some evidence that a reformed patent system will significantly increase innovation?&quot;

Yes, here is some historical evidence:  http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html 

The 1474 Venice patent act predates that city-state getting into manufacturing--coindence?  Not. 

The 1624 English reform of patent monopolies predated England becoming a manufacturing powerhouse--coincidence? Not. 

The US Founding Fathers thought patents so important they put it into the US Constitution, and the rest is history--coincidence? Not.

US Patent were reformed so as to abolish the need for a working model in 1880, and US industrialization took off after that change--coincidence?  Not.

U.S. Patent Act of 1952 clarified and simplified existing U.S. patent law and the US economy enjoyed a Golden Age thereafter--coincidence?  Not.

US Patent law was restricted by caselaw in the 1960s and 70s to make it harder to get a patent--and US productivity slowed down around the early 1970s--coincidence?  Not.

US patent law was again relaxed by R. Reagan&#039;s administration with the creation of a special court to hear patent cases, and make patents stronger, in 1982; the US economy and stock market boomed--coincidence?  Not.

You may ignore the evidence, or you may say it is a coincidence, or you may say that the patent laws were concomitant or coincident with the events that followed--that&#039;s your choice depending on your ideology.   
 
&quot; Reforming the patent system might one of my five factors — how much an inventor benefits. Please notice there are four other factors. It is far from clear that lack of benefit is the big problem now.&quot; - if it&#039;s &quot;far from clear&quot;, then I may possibly have a point, yes?  I&#039;m glad you have an open mind on this issue professor.  Thanks for the soapbox.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t think the evidence you provide supports your position. It takes decades for a new invention to have a significant effect on the economy -- to grow big enough. Yet you describe cases where the economic change  followed the patent law change much soon than that. For example, your 1982 example. On the other hand, yes, you may have a point. I mentioned Why Nations Fail which makes roughly the same point as you are making. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Professor, please let the scales drop from your eyes!  CNTRL + F &quot;patents&quot; yields NO hits on this blog post. NONE!  Please quit being blinded by ideology and mention how a reformed patent system can increase innovation.  How government--say by offering a prize as GMU&#039;s Alex Taberrok has suggested, with the invention then becoming public domain--can increase innovation.  Inventions *can* be &#039;engineered&#039;.  It is a humanities major&#039;s myth that inventions happen in a &#039;flash of genius&#039; akin to a lightbulb going off.  Please turn the corner and take your arguments to the next level--mention PATENTS.  It&#039;s amazing how economists think that because good Samaritan nerds who invent for free (yes, they not only exist, pretty much all Nobel Prize winners are in this category, and are responsible for much of human progress) are the only people out there.  If inventions were better compensated by government, you would have more of them.  It&#039;s akin to a &quot;public good&quot;.  Thank you!

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand the point of your Bangladesh example. It just sounds like government causing a pecuniary shift from South Korea to Bangladesh rather than any innovation.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It was more than a location shift. It was the discovery that you could get good output using a lower-quality location. In Bangladesh the workers were less well-educated than in Korea and there were many other differences. It was somewhat like discovering a new source of energy.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see a central planning fallacy here. Who knows what the right amount of innovation is?

It also boils down to a moral question. People should be free to do what they want so long as it does not harm others or interfere in the others&#039; freedom to do what they want -- this is liberty. Government&#039;s pain violates liberty.

Is violating liberty justified because it might increase innovation?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Long ago, at the very dawn of governments, everyone had a choice: live under a government (coercive but also protective) or not (no coercion, no protection). Apparently the government system was the more popular choice, since that&#039;s what we have now. Now there is no longer much of a choice. Governments provide both loss of freedom (coercion) and protection. It seems to me not to be a &quot;moral&quot; question but an economic one: is the cost (coercion) worth the benefit (protection)? The innovation is a kind of unanticipated bonus, that the original choosers (between government and no government) didn&#039;t think about. Curiously governments, by producing pain, caused better governments to be invented. That&#039;s where democracy came from -- government-induced pain.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;In a free market I wonder if people would have been doing the personal science anyways since market forces would push towards that which is normally most efficient and cost effective.&quot;

Whereas I think the fact that people can find health specialists (doctors) pushes them away from studying their own health. They would rather leave it to the specialist -- do what the specialist says. They fail to understand that the fact that the specialist needs to make money has a big effect on what he advises. They fail to understand how much they are losing. When I started to study my own sleep (to improve it), I had no idea how much better solutions I could find compared to what a doctor would tell me to do (take sleeping pills).]]></description>

Okay, tell me one major innovation that &lt;strong&gt;didn&#039;t&lt;/strong&gt; come from the elite and powerful? Darwin: inherited wealth, didn&#039;t have to work. Mendel: rich religious order. Pasteur: powerful chemist. Bell Labs: rich, AT&amp;T very powerful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Collectivism in all its various forms (e.g., coercive economic regulation &amp; central planning) has consistently failed to so in all of history.&quot;

You don&#039;t realize that all governments have collectivist (= coercive) elements? You think that the Internet and greenbacks -- not to mention Darwin&#039;s theory of evolution -- arose because of &quot;free markets&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nature puts more than enough pain and irritants in human life paths;  no need for artificial (government) obstacles to increase that vast natural burden.

The natural state of human beings on this planet is abject poverty, suffering and death.  The only economic system ever known to raise large masses of population from poverty-- is free market capitalism;  collectivism in all its various forms (e.g., coercive economic regulation &amp; central planning) has consistently failed to so in all of history.

The post was obviously intended as a mild slam against libertarians and free markets.  Note that &quot;innovation&quot; is a central principle of free market economics -- it&#039;s an absurd assertion to proclaim otherwise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There was no government pain in 1947 when hydraulic fracturing (fracking) was invented. I would say just the opposite. Now that it is economically beneficial to employ it, and it is wildly successful, there is going to be a whole lot of government pain brought to bare in the form of regulations and restrictions on its use. 

So the question is, will this new government pain bring about innovation (which will then be regulated and restricted) or less energy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To encourage innovation by academics, I recommend that a large proportion of research funds be distributed by drawing lots.  (i) Then instead of devoting time to preparing untruthful grant applications they can devote time to their work, or to productive leisure. (ii) With smaller grants, they will be obliged to be more ingenious in their work.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, I agree. The Canadian system is similar, lots of small grants.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
