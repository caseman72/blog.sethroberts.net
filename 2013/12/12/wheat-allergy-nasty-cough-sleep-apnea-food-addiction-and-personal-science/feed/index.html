		<description><![CDATA[There are *so* many weird allergies you can get.

I have an inhalation allergy to polyester and acrylic dust which has caused no end of trouble, and which took 20 years to figure out.  Eliminating those has been extraordinarily difficult and still isn&#039;t done.  I have a collection of other problems remaining, unfortunately, including one (dry skin) which got significantly worse after I eliminated the allergens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was in my late fifties when I developed an intolerance for Brazil nuts.  I didn&#039;t even appreciate the source of my stomach problem until I came across a remark in Jim Watson&#039;s book &quot;DNA&quot; about a genetic inability to tolerate a particular protein in the nut.  Why my genetics chose to lie doggo for fifty years I&#039;ve no idea.

P.S. The Wikipedia article on Brazil nuts contains no warning of this effect.
P.P.S.  The index of the Watson book doesn&#039;t let you trace his remark.  It reminds me of a warning I got as an undergraduate: an American textbook may well have superb diagrams but will always have a lousy index.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I certainly think it&#039;s possible people are allergic to foods, I just don&#039;t understand how it can be the result of eating the same thing over and over again. That&#039;s what most people have always done, historically, and continue to do. Things like bread and rice were staples, people had them every day, day in day out, throughout the year. It beggars belief that this could cause allergies. One could be allergic to wheat or develop it at some point but I don&#039;t see how regularly eating wheat could be the &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt; of that. 

I never suffered any particular symptoms and I eliminated wheat and dairy and sugar from my diet several times and never felt any different so I know that for me it makes almost no difference what I eat as long as I eat basically healthy (veggies, fruits, meat, fats, grains) but I don&#039;t deny that other people have vastly different experiences. To each his own. These days I eat what tastes good and what I crave, even a little bit of junk food, while trying to keep it balanced and healthy. But that&#039;s just me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read Perimutter, but FWIW, I&#039;m skeptical of in vitro tests for food allergies. To many positive results, and I don&#039;t think they match what really happens the body. No one I know is an IV bread user.

Instead, I think if one very thoughtfully pays attention to their mind and body, the food allergies will make themselves known easily enough.

Does one have some sort of chronic problem that&#039;s been attribute to age or bad luck? Is one&#039;s body shape weirdly out of proportion? Are there mornings you just can&#039;t get out of bed, or conversely, nights were you just can&#039;t sleep? If so, it&#039;s likely a food allergy. And if not, don&#039;t sweat it. Keep doing whatever you&#039;ve been doing. :)

But if you&#039;re suspicious, it should be easy enough to _completely_ remove the food from your diet for 7-10 days. Then add it back in with a normal meal of it and see how your system handles it. Classic n=1 testing at its simplest and best. Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How is it possible to develop allergies from eating the same foods frequently? Until recently nearly all societies around the world ate the same foods with near complete regularity. There were SOME seasonal changes in fruit and vegetables but for instance bread was eaten year around for one&#039;s entire life in Europe and rice was eaten year around in Asia and so was cheese and meat and a host of other foods. Are we expected to believe that people developed allergies to these foods? In some tropical climates there wasn&#039;t even seasonal variations and people at an unvarying diet of sweet potatoes, coconut, fish, and some roots and tubers yet were reported as quite healthy.

So what doesn&#039;t add up here? Is that just another myth?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  the Grain Brain book by neurologist Perlmutter mentions something that might provide a metabolic explanation for your butter and cognition results:  &#039;Most important, cholesterol is looked upon as an essential fuel for the neurons.  Neurons themselves are unable to generate significant cholesterol; instead they rely on delivery of cholesterol from the bloodstream via a specific carrier protein.  Interestingly, this carrier protein, LDL, has been given the derogatory title &quot;bad cholesterol.&quot;  In reality, LDL is not a cholesterol molecule at all, good or bad.  It&#039;s a low-density lipoprotein (hence its acronym), and there is absolutely nothing bad about it.  The fundamental role of LDL in the brain, again, is to capture life-giving cholesterol and transport it to the neuron, where it performs critically important functions.&#039;    Do you have any knowledge of this?  I have never heard of this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[dearieme:  my experience is that all the grains except rice cause the reaction,and the amount can be very small.  Sometimes I escape, but I cannot say why.  It might be gut bugs that make a difference.  

portlander:  overcoming resistance to a needed test or change often demands hearing it from more than one person, and a crisis.  You and your friend were both important.  It&#039;s just human nature, I think.  Perhaps if we all learned to think better, it would not be so true, or if we mastered some of Seth&#039;s regular self-testing?  Of course, this kind of resistance varies a lot across individuals.

I think one of Seth&#039;s big points is that experts end up exploiting those weaknesses, and personal science is a way of counteracting that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My former manager at work was a textbook wheat allergy case just like this guy, wheat belly, snoring, cough, chronic health niggles, whole nine yards.

For _years_ that I knew him he had this strange cough that I&#039;d assumed was some sort of tick, like some people crack their fingers. It had gotten so that I&#039;d stoped noticing it even. I would drop hints about low carb and so forth after I&#039;d discovered it, but (hopefully) I was never overbearing or anything. He&#039;s a pretty conventional wisdom type of guy so I wanted to let him know the &quot;new thinking&quot; on Atkins, as I called it.

Then, one day he was talking and mentioned that his cough was from acid reflux and he had been on various meds and so forth, but they weren&#039;t working so he was going to have to have surgery to fix his esophagus which was being eroded by stomach acid and the irritation from the stomach acid was the source of his cough.

When was explaining that a contractor happened to be standing next to me and we were good friends and he had learned the whole low carb &amp; wheat deal from me. The contractor unloaded on the guy. Saying straight-up, and not much nicer than this, that he knows his problems are from diet, and he is absolutely crazy to be choosing surgery instead giving up donuts and beer. He&#039;s like a diabetic letting his legs get amputated, or a smoker losing one lung. Besides, it&#039;s not like the surgery is going to fix the problem, it&#039;s just fixing the most obvious symptom. As an engineer, the manager should understand that. In a sheepish and quite voice the manager said, &quot;yeah, I know but I like that stuff.&quot;

Well apparently staring down the knife caused him to re-think it all and he gave up wheat completely, cough went away, sleep was better, and he dropped about 20 lbs in 2 months. Again, textbook. I find all of it amazing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All of my allergy symptoms - sinus congestion, cough, watery / itchy eyes, frequent sneezing - all cleared up when I gave up wheat and milk (I still consume butter and heavy cream without any problems - I&#039;m not lactose intolerant, but lactose free whey protein will cause digestive distress - it must be the proteins, not the fat or sugar, in milk that I&#039;m intolerant of). 

I gave up all grains for a couple of years, now I eat white rice and corn occasionally (tortillas) without any of the allergy symptoms coming back. I eat real ice cream (no additives) occasionally, but I can feel it in my sinuses. If I eat it a couple of days in a row, or drink a couple of glasses of milk, I wake up with sinus congestion. 

Here&#039;s an article in the Daily Beast, which talks about wheat, and wheat germ agglutinin in particular: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/10/wheat-threatens-all-humans-new-research-shows.html

		<description><![CDATA[I also wonder if doctors get the cause and effect order wrong. They always say obesity causes apnea. But many slim people also suffer from apnea. It&#039;s possible that having apnea destroys your sleep and thereby encourages muscle loss/weight gain. Or perhaps there&#039;s a feedback loop involved. Thanks for your comments Cliff]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do people who give up wheat tend to replace it with other grains: rice, oats, barley, rye …?  Are those grains more benign to the wheat-intolerant?

Is it ever enough to reduce wheat intake, or must one expect to need to eliminate it?]]></description>
