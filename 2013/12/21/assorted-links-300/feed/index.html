		<description><![CDATA[If you wake up feeling &quot;jittery&quot; you should check your blood sugar. I&#039;ve found that if I wake up like this, it&#039;s usually somewhat elevated (~95 to 110). I&#039;ve also observed that if I lay around in bed reading for a few hours, it will also rise a little. But getting up between 5:30 and 8:00, and getting the day started seems to keep sugar in the normal range.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, have you looked into traditional Chinese medicine?-- it takes season and time of day seriously.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I hear a lot about the seasonal stuff, much less about the time of day.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re not reading these snippets carefully enough, Seth. The aspirin at night study didn&#039;t find that &quot;Patients who took blood pressure medication at night were about a third as likely to have a heart attack or stroke as morning medication takers&quot;.  That was some other study. This aspirin study found no effect on blood pressure of when the aspirin was taken.

It also didn&#039;t find that taking aspirin in the evening vs morning reduced stroke or heart attack rates.  It only found that evening aspirin reduced platelet activity the next morning, and it didn&#039;t measure even half of the participants at that.   And the study wasn&#039;t blinded to the participants, either.

See http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/11November/Pages/Bedtime-aspirin-cuts-morning-heart-attack-risk.aspx.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I knew that blood pressure medication is not the same as aspirin. I agree, my brief description did not make that clear. I hope you can make an equally long list of what was good about the aspirin study.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
