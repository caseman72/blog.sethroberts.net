		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
Do you still have a percentile feedback tracking app on the back burner?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Still working on it. I use an R version every day.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My thoughts are similar to those of Niles.
First, I&#039;ve also gone to a trianlge, but with 5-minute increments, so that each triangle is a half hour.  (The half hour blocks minimize the starting friction problem mentioned by @Kristian).
Second, I&#039;ve also started keeping a record for tracking purposes.  I think the initial benefits mentioned in earlier posts were mostly directed to getting started and keeping momentum.  Magic dots are also a great tool for tracking work over time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve added a &quot;magic dot timer&quot; to my pomodoro app. I thought the 25-minute timebox was the highes resolution time management that I could apply, but being allowed to make a little bit of tangible progress every five minutes *does* make a difference. It&#039;s rather surprising that the constant distraction isn&#039;t actually counterproductive.
One problem that I find though, as with all gamification, is that I tend to think that if I won&#039;t have enough time to finish a complete pattern, I might as well not start at all. This applies to pomodoros in general as well--if I don&#039;t have a full 25 minutes before that meeting, I often catch myself wasting the 15 minutes that I do have.]]></description>
