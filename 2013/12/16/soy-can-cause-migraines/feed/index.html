		<description><![CDATA[A coeliac (therefore not eating gluten anyway), 2 years ago I developed a serious inner ear infection, and was put onto IV augmentin and ppi. Within 48 hours I was reacting to soy in mayonnaise, with immense stomach bloating. I was going from a flat stomach to looking as if I was 6 months pregnant, in 20 - 40 mins, and it was taking at least 30 hours to go down. 

It took me long time to realise it was the soy - I kept thinking it was the egg to start with. 

I still react to soy, but now it&#039;s as if it were gluten - causing stomach cramps for days and some bloating. The only  variant that does not cause a problem is Japanese fermented soy sauce - it can&#039;t be some cheap substitute. I don&#039;t eat it very often though - I suspect if I had it regularly I would react more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[wheat &gt; leaky gut= soy &gt; leaky vessels???  Especially if GMO soy.  I try to avoid all GMO grains and I gave up wheat several years ago and my GERD disappeared
permanently in just two weeks!  I now buy flour from a company that uses only
organic ancient Einkhorn wheat.  I still eat very little of my home made bread.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It may be worth noting that soy was one of the first things to be genetically modified, or so I&#039;ve been told. That might be why it&#039;s being put into so much, if they developed cheap and pest resistant varieties with high yields, the usual aim of any GM program. For that reason I like to avoid all but the organic, non GM versions. 
Another crop I believe is modified is corn, since, having loved it and eaten it frequently growing up, suddenly in the mid 90s I found it was not digesting properly, if at all, and causing issues because of it. Funnily enough, when I find organic heirloom varieties, I have no such problems and it&#039;s like when I enjoyed it as a kid again.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: very interesting point.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
