		<description><![CDATA[Here is another experimental study of some merit that can easily be replicated. Researchers have found that drinking mineral water rich in silica can remove aluminum from the body and in some cases, actually reverse symptoms of Alzheimer&#039;s disease. The waters richest in silica are the Volvic and Fiji brands:

		<description><![CDATA[Ozquoll, try taking the honey on its own without adding another food (resistant starch) simultaneously as I&#039;ve found that certain foods can hinder the effect of honey. Also try switching to a different honey and have a break from eating between your last meal/desert and taking the honey (maybe 2 hours or more).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -

If you&#039;re still doing alternate day fasting, it seems like your calories on fasting days much be climbing with all the food that you need to eat for your health (e.g., butter, flax, banana, honey, etc.).  I believe you&#039;d said in the past you consume 700 - 800 calories on fasting days.  Adding a banana and 1 TBS of honey adds around 160 - 180 calories.  How is that impacting your fasting blood sugar readings and other health measures?

Thanks for patiently answering all my questions.  Your writing has dramatically improved my health in a number of ways.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The banana and 1 T honey seem to have improved my fasting blood sugar readings but it is a complex question because obviously blood sugar will be elevated for hours after eating honey. So I am not sure. I am sure however that the better sleep has improved my health. It is obvious: feel better, stronger, more energy, more motivation.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sadly the honey at bedtime approach did not work for me at all - I gave it up after three nights of very poor sleep, punctuated by vivid nightmares when I actually was asleep. However, I have had greatly improved sleep (&amp; blood glucose control) from taking resistant starch as discussed at length on Richard Nikoley&#039;s blog. 

There is at least one American dentist who knows about Xylitol - Ellie Phillips. She&#039;s got a book, but the following page on he website gives a pretty good rundown of her thoughts on dental care: http://www.drellie.com/Ellie-Phillips-My-Recommendations.php

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You might want to try a smaller dose of honey and/or banana. Too much will certainly produce bad sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Pockets: flaxseed oil or other omega-3 source&quot;

it would not surprise me if there is something &#039;special&#039; about flaxseed itself that improves gum health, &amp; omega-3 may Or may not be a part of that. 

i cannot recall seeing/reading any studies or anecdotes that reported improvements in gum health from just taking omega-3 ie. fish oils or fish supplements...?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -

Just curious if you&#039;ve tried honey instead of a banana yet for your other source of sugar 2 - 3 hours before bedtime?  If so, have you noticed any difference in your sleep rating?

OT, what source of faces are you currently using for morning faces?

TIA

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, for the sugar 2-3 hrs before bedtime I&#039;ve just eaten a banana. For faces nowadays I use about 6 bloggingheads shows with relatively large faces. I put them on a large monitor.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the topic of sugars and sleep, I&#039;ve recently started an experiment with taking D-Mannose  to see if it has any impact on night time urination. I often get up once in the night for this, so I&#039;m in the process of looking for ways to stop it.

I wonder if anyone else has had any experiences with using d-mannose ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve miraculously avoided cavities for all of my 34 years, but my dentist still complains; tells me to floss more... perhaps I&#039;ll try swishing some xylitol for a single-blind study (I won&#039;t tell my dentist about it).

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Floss more, why? Because of pockets? My pockets greatly improved exactly when I started drinking flaxseed oil. My plaque did not improve. Plaque: xylitol. Pockets: flaxseed oil or other omega-3 source.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh dearieme that is funny...

Seth, I think you&#039;re a little harsh on the LC / Paleo people about sugar/honey, or at lease a little overly general. I believe the majority today would say the dose makes the poison.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: As Gina says, many paleo people use the term &quot;safe starch&quot;. Meaning that sugar is not a safe starch. The &quot;safe starch&quot; view opposes the idea that all starches are bad. Not one person has said that sugar is not the problem, which is exactly what I said in The Shangri-La Diet. All this stuff about how honey improves sleep (no doubt because of its sugar content) is more evidence that sugar is not the problem. Maybe they would say &quot;the dose makes the poison&quot; but that would be further misunderstanding. It&#039;s the time of day that makes the poison. I haven&#039;t heard anyone in the paleo community say that, with the notable exception of Tara Grant, who figured out that the time of day she took her Vitamin D made an enormous difference.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been self experimenting with a coconut oil mouth wash in the morning.  It&#039;s typically 10 to 15 minutes and it has resulted in healthier gums, less sensitivity to cold and a small improvement in whiteness.

Also this past year I started playing around with raw apple cider vinegar before bed.  I usually have major sinus issues in the winter, which leads to having a humidifier constantly running along with nasal rinses and vaporub.  So far the ACV has been a huge success.  0 congestion, 0 nasal rinses, 0 vaporub applications but a couple of humidifier sleep sessions.

In addition to using honey at bedtime I&#039;ve also toyed with blocking out blue light by wearing orange glasses and being made fun of by my wife.  I&#039;m not sure if this has been a success.  I need to separate it out from the honey and see what happens.  I am confident that the belittling will continue.]]></description>

I usually have major sinus issues in the winter, which leads to having a humidifier constantly running along with nasal rinses and vaporub.  So far the ACV has been a huge success.  0 congestion, 0 nasal rinses, 0 vaporub applications but a couple of humidifier sleep sessions.</p>
<p>In addition to using honey at bedtime I&#8217;ve also toyed with blocking out blue light by wearing orange glasses and being made fun of by my wife.  I&#8217;m not sure if this has been a success.  I need to separate it out from the honey and see what happens.  I am confident that the belittling will continue.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello. I am interested in the honey experiment. I Live in south america and here we ate more late at night I think, like at 21 or 22 hs I understand that in the US you eat earlier. At what time is your lat meal? I ask becaiuse I think this can affect what taking honey can produce.

Is the script from both available? Do  you think http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/ can be a good tool to use as a test?

Thanks

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I eat dinner around 6 pm. Eat banana around 7-8 pm, have honey close to bedtime (around 10 pm). If you are interested in my brain test software, please email me. I think the cambridge brain sciences stuff takes too long and, based on my experience, the tests are poorly chosen. But I haven&#039;t tried it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Consuming even small amounts of xylitol gives me diarrhea.  But I add xylitol to my mouthwash.

On another subject:  Seth, what happened to your productivity around August or September?  Seems like there was a sharp drop, and your recovery took four months or so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another upvote for xylitol from me. 

It tastes good in green tea (I use 8 - 12g per cup), and, along with your recommendation of having a couple of tablespoons of flaxseed oil daily (although not at the same time as the tea) , makes a huge improvement in how healthy and pain-free my teeth and gums feel.]]></description>
