		<description><![CDATA[So one tsp of honey a night is working for me and it made me think: DayQuil in pill form is great, but I always used to swear that the NyQuil pills weren&#039;t as good as the liquid. 

Maybe the reason it made me sleep better and feel better when I woke up had something to do with essentially taking a shot of sugar liquid right before bed.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think you&#039;re right:

		<description><![CDATA[Not just a well-known Chinese remedy...

I don&#039;t have time to check whether someone else mentioned this, but when I lived in Croatia (former Yugoslavia, really) a tablespoon of honey mixed with water and apple cider vinegar served at room temperature and sipped slowly before bedtime was not uncommon. My grandparents, now in their late 80s, still use it when they feel restless before bed. When I tried doing this every day for a summer, I was able to fall asleep within 30 minutes, and it usually takes me closer to an hour. I may have felt more rested, can&#039;t remember.

Unfortunately I&#039;m just too lazy to do this every night.

PS A quick search showed there was an earlier post on honey + apple cider. oh well :)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Forgive me, but I fall asleep within a minute. It&#039;s no great secret why, see my post about what I&#039;ve learned about sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I mentioned that honey might aid sleep to my wife &amp; she said &quot;duh, everyone knows that!&quot; Apparently it is well-known in the Chinese-speaking world.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Ask your wife what fraction of her Chinese friends actually do it. It is not &quot;well-known&quot; in the sense of commonly done. However, the Chinese certainly see honey as more of a health food than Americans do.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s an earlier post on honey that has a drink of cider vinegar and honey as the recipe.  As for honey not being vegan, you&#039;ve hit on one of the controversies of that world. 

There is NO consensus on this. The issue is the question of whether you are abstaining from using all animal products to avoid causing them suffering or to avoid any form of exploitation. The former will include honey since they&#039;re not being forced to produce it and don&#039;t have any adverse consequences from us taking it. The latter won&#039;t. 

As for using maple syrup as an alternative, frankly I&#039;m surprised that someone against suffering and/or exploitation would suggest it. Forcing a tree to bleed regularly is better than taking something that&#039;s produced painlessly by an insect? 

Disclosure here, I&#039;m not vegan, and I eat both (as well as bleeding myself regularly for the blood bank). But I&#039;m getting my results from milk and honey.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: What about causing animals pleasure? What if doing X causes animals pleasure? Why is that neglected from these calculations of the effect of this or that human action on animals?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, I just recently found out about your blog and all the self experimenting you do. 

I am currently trialling raw cold processed honey and have noticed that my sleep isn&#039;t as refreshing as store bought pasturized honey? According to David Asprey Raw Honey is 22% better at making liver glycogen and should improve sleep more but I&#039;m noticing not as sound sleep! Thoughts?

From my own experimenting I&#039;ve noticed that when I take too much honey (over 1 tsbp + ) my sleep isn&#039;t as good as taking 1 or 2 teaspoons. 

Also +1 for cutting sugar during the day to improve the effects of honey for sleep!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think Dave overstated things. Too much is unknown about the effect to be sure raw honey is better than pasteurized.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve not tried this (yet), but in searching for something related to apple cider vinegar, I saw a comment that honey wasn&#039;t vegan. The poster suggested trying maple syrup as an alternative. It&#039;d be interesting to see if that works the same as honey for those who use it to help their sleep.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, maple syrup is worth trying.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
