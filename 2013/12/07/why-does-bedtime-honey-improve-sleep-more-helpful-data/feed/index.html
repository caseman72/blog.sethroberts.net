		<description><![CDATA[Warning about resistant starch.  It&#039;s great for a lot of people, but for some people, like me, it&#039;s absolutely horrible and leads consistently to digestive upset.  I had to learn to avoid it as much as possible.

I think it depends on the nature of your personal digestive system.  My hormone/neurotransmitter balance runs towards a very, very slow-digesting digestive system to start with.  Slowing it down further causes gas, bloating, and cramps.  It&#039;s important that I eat stuff which digests *quickly*, because for me, quickly is a matter of hours. 

I figured this out in a fairly unpleasant way due to neurotransmitter-balance-altering medications and really bad digestive reactions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I take the potato starch after my evening meal in order to experience vivid dreams (which I assume is a healthy symptom),and to encourage a complete bowel emptying upon rising in the morning, and to minimize flatulence during daytime hours at work.  
The meaning of a vivid dream for me is:  when I briefly awake from a dream, I realize that my dream was of long duration with many &quot;scenes&quot; and that those &quot;scenes&quot; were vivid; however, generally I can&#039;t remember the dreams in the morning when I get up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Given that RS&#039;s physical properties don&#039;t allow it to be digested and affect blood glucose, it stands to reason that time of day doesn&#039;t have any effect. 

I don&#039;t know for sure whether the time of dosage influences the sleep effect. Most people seem to be breaking up their intake into two doses, daytime and evening. Though my guess is that there is a correlation, as a nighttime dose would feed your gut/boost SCFAs closer to bed. I don&#039;t know if anyone&#039;s tested this.

Also, figuring out if honey lowers morning FBG would be a relevant finding, as it would bring it that much closer to mirroring the RS mechanism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is the best explanation because:

a) It is undigested, and its only effect is fermentation of bacteria and production of SCFA.

b) Butyrate&#039;s (the primary SCFA stimulated by RS) effect on blood glucose is well-established.

c) Again, blood glucose does not rise with intake of RS. Day or night. Try it yourself.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: How do you know that blood glucose during the night does not rise with intake of RS? I cannot measure my blood glucose while asleep or I would try it. Also, to get the sleep improvement provided by RS, at what time of day can the RS be eaten? In the examples I&#039;ve read, it was eaten in the evening. What about eating it in the morning?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And in fact, people&#039;s fasting blood glucose in the morning is lower when supplementing with RS, as a result of the SCFAs. Whether or not the lower FBG is what&#039;s resulting in better sleep is not clear.

To see if the same thing is happening with honey, I think the test is simple enough. Measure your morning FBG after a day without any honey. Take honey that evening, and measure your FBG the next morning. If it&#039;s lower, then you&#039;ve replicated the RS mechanism.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that simple. You write: &quot;People&#039;s fasting blood glucose in the morning is lower when supplementing with RS, as a result of the SCFAs.&quot; Why is SCFAs the only possible (or even the best) explanation of why their FBG is lower? What about the possibility that RS increases BG at night and this lowers FBG? People who like RS make a big deal of how it differs from other starch, but if a banana (with no RS) at bedtime also improves sleep and lowers FBG -- just like RS -- I begin to doubt they understand the effects of RS as well as they think they do.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But it doesn&#039;t increase blood glucose. It&#039;s an indigestible fiber. It passes through undigested and is fermented in the colon. People on ketogenic diets who supplement with RS stay in ketosis. No rise.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I was under the impression that RS is slowly digested starch, not undigested starch. I agree that some of it is not turned into glucose, but I am not so sure that none of it is. However, I agree with you that it is not settled. It&#039;s just that when a starch (resistant or not) greatly improves sleep, and sugars greatly improve sleep, and this would explain why we eat dessert, it is tempting to think that the starch improves sleep because of the sugars it generates. Rather than assume two different mechanisms.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not necessarily. While increasing bacterial count takes longer supplementation, short-chain fatty acid production by one&#039;s existing bacteria (which is what creates the hypoglycemic effect) should happen right upon dosage, whether it&#039;s the first time or the hundredth.

And from anecdotal accounts, many experience the sleep affects of RS almost immediately.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The brain -- which controls sleep -- runs on glucose. It does not run on SCFAs. To say that small changes in SCFA concentration affect the brain you have to get really speculative (speculative = beyond what is known). What about the possibility that RS improves sleep because it increases blood glucose during the night? Based on my theory that it is the glucose produced by honey that matters, I predict that if I take the honey 10 hours before bedtime it won&#039;t improve my sleep. Does the SCFA theory predict what will happen if I do that? &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I&#039;m surprised no one&#039;s made the probiotic/prebiotic connection between honey and RS. That might explain it. Honey contains oligosaccharides, which feed bacteria and cause blood glucose to stabilize. Just like RS.

		<description><![CDATA[Tom I think you may be on to something there - I don&#039;t know much about &#039;fat adaption&#039; but I noticed my sleep was excellent recently for over a week (I have been measuring my sleep quality) and interestingly enough, that week I lost weight. I got on the scale every morning, and everyday there was a small reduction in weight which ended up being about 1kg (about 2 pounds). 
As part of my experimentation (trying different dietary approaches), my weight went back up (everyday) to where it originally was after another week or so and my sleep declined dramatically. I think there is a correlation between the two things which probably suggests I was doing something which was good for me. 
I did originally discover the honey when I was very low carb and it worked well then. I quit very low carb because of health problems it created. I think I might try alternate day fasting for a couple of weeks to see if that improved the honey effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About that glucose/fructose thing, I have a way to test the hypothesis: table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are both about 50-50 glucose/fructose. So if honey aids sleep by providing the sugar mix, then so would a tablespoon of table sugar in water, or a few ounces of non-caffeinated soda.

I wonder if anyone in the dieting group taking the sugar water before bed has had improved sleep?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m not sure the timing of blood glucose would be the same comparing table sugar and honey. Table sugar is not 50/50 glucose/fructose, it is 100% sucrose. Yes, the sucrose is split into glucose and fructose, but that takes a while. But HFCS should work.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[“In a previous honey-sleep entry, you quoted someone noting that raw honey had less effect than cooked honey”

one possible reason, some people may be &#039;sensitive&#039; to raw honey, 
ie. raw honey usually contains small amounts of propolis and pollen, it could be possible that this is problematic for a few people...&amp; therefore cancel out the sleep benefits &amp; possibly even worsen sleep.

this may or may not be an allergy, idk, but i did see mention of a &#039;honey allergy&#039; which listed some possible symptoms to look for, 
- Itchy throat,
- Tongue swelling up,
- Watery eyes,
- Hives or constant sneezing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;In a previous honey-sleep entry, you quoted someone noting that raw honey had less effect than cooked honey&quot;

I think someone theorized that. I don&#039;t think there was any evidence it was true. I suppose the theory was wrong. Someone who actually compared the two found no difference between raw and cooked honey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have never had any problems sleeping.  I have been taking potato starch after my evening meal since July and have been taking a tablespoon of honey since Seth mentioned it in his blog.  I noticed more vivid dreaming from the potato starch and hope that it helps my colon since colon cancer and other colon problems have occurred in my family.  I look forward to taking the honey before I go to bed and I love its taste; I haven&#039;t noticed anything from taking the honey.]]></description>

Yes, the rest between workouts was my initial impression of what happened to an older fellow in a previous post with bell presses. It is well documented that allowing for more rest makes greater strength gains. I would imagine better sleep would promote strength gains. Working out more infrequently resulted in similar gains for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding muscle strength improvement I have two thoughts:

1.  Increase might come from improved sleep.

2.  Increase might come from sufficient rests between workouts.  I find I gain strength more consistently though working out 1-2 x per week versus 3-7 x per week.  Muscles take a lot of time to repair it seems.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: when my sleep improved due to honey, the timing of my workouts (daily) did not change. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
