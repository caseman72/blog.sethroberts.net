		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the tip about the Hibernation Diet.

Looking at Amazon, it seems as if the author has a new book out shortly as well, The Honey Diet (2nd Jan 2014 on the Kindle).

The blurb mentions &quot;Just a tablespoon of honey every night before you go to bed&quot; along with a list of benefits, including better sleep.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yeah, independent discovery.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -

I&#039;ve noticed a similar feeling from taking honey at night.  How would you compare the honey induced increased sense of well being to the mood benefits you get from morning faces?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The mood benefits of morning faces are well described as happy eager and serene. Very obvious. The honey effect is a deep feeling of well-being. Less obvious.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t you just think that all these other benefits stem from improved  sleep quality?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes. But they are not obvious benefits of better sleep and they have not accompanied previous sleep improvements of mine.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
