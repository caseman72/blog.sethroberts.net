		<description><![CDATA[I have gluten allergy and dairy sensitivity (not lactose intolerant) and when traveling to Italy this past fall I ate all the bread, pasta and cheese I wanted with no ill effects. I do believe there is a difference in the foods in Europe. Could it be the bromated flour here, which is not used in Europe?
I am going to try the honey tonight. I stumbled across this blog from Tim Ferris on FB. Glad I did!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the topic of wheat, Joel Salatin had an interesting take on it.  His theory is that in pre-mechanized times, when wheat was harvested and tied into sheafs and allowed to stand in the field for several weeks, that the dew each night caused a mild fermentation.

Weston Price and observed that the health benefits of whole grain wheat were only gained when the wheat was freshly ground an eaten within days.

Modern wheat not only is harvested straight into the combine, but the flours can be years old by the time they are consumed, plenty of time for the omega oils in them to oxidize.

I have seen comments by some (American) people that have wheat sensitivities, but to do not have them when travelling in  europe, and they attribute that to different types of wheat being grown there.

Finally, on the topic of kefir settling the stomach, I can personally attest to that, it does wonders!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  your comment about fermented food may be apt.  

Here&#039;s one small test I have done over the last couple of years, because of an accidental discovery.  On vacation, I tend to indulge eating bread or pizza, and that night my snoring will increase and the cough will come back the next morning.  Well, a couple of years ago while on vacation we happened to stop at a small farmstead which advertised cheese.  The cheese was excellent, and they also made yogurt, an intense and funky yogurt that I loved.  

I ate quite a bit of it that day, after eating quite a bit of bread at lunch and dinner, and the next morning - no cough, and my wife said I had been very quiet that night.  

So, I have tried this experiment perhaps half a dozen times since then, and a little more than half the time taking yogurt at bedtime on a day I have indulged in some wheat product will eliminate the reaction.  The older, funkier the yogurt, the better, store-fresh yogurt either works poorly or not at all.  

Perhaps not conclusive, but suggestive?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Maybe the microbes in the yogurt and cheese made it harder for the wheat molecules to be absorbed into the blood. The microbes and microbe fragments clogged a lot of holes that would not otherwise be clogged. It&#039;s a very interesting argument for the importance of fermented foods. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife and I have been testing honey at bedtime for a couple of weeks, and we have both had a noticeable improvement in sleep, mostly in the 3am restless wakeup period disappearing.  She has more trouble with this than I have, so she found the improvement easy to notice.

We take it with a nighttime concoction the includes a nitric oxide releaser and some kefir.

That said, the thing that improved my sleep most dramatically was eliminating wheat from my diet several years ago.  Before that I had a ferocious sleep apnea and snoring problem (which my wife would attest to).  The sleep apnea went completely away and has not returned, and the snoring is down about 90%.  One side effect of the sleep apnea, also gone, was probably long nightmares where I was frequently killed by monsters in my dreams - those, too, are long gone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A traditional remedy for insomnia is a teaspoon of honey in a glass of warm milk.   

The honey part you have already gotten.   

Maybe milk helps also.  Lactose is a type of sugar and may work with honey.   Perhaps the calcium in milk calms the nerves and also makes healing / growing at sleep easier.  Finally, amino acids in milk may have a calming effect.  

Anyone test himself using milk as well as honey?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hold on; I&#039;ve just googled &quot;liquorice twist&quot;.  Here&#039;s the ingredients list from Tesco (a British supermarket chain).

Treacle, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Glucose Syrup, Desiccated Coconut, Vegetable Oil, Glazing Agent (Beeswax), Liquorice Extract, Beef Gelatine, Flavourings, Humectant (Glycerol), Colours (Plain Caramel, Beetroot Red, Curcumin, Capsanthin), Fat Reduced Cocoa Powder.

With its treacle, sugar, glucose and beeswax it sounds a bit like synthetic honey.  A bit short of fructose, maybe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking about what sort of cheerer-uppers might encourage sleep if taken by the glass, so that both sugars and alcohol would help send you to the land of nod.  Various digestifs are obvious possibilities; so is Pedro Ximénez sherry, or Bual or Malmsey Madeiras; I wonder how well this lesser-known drink would do.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineau_des_Charentes

My motive is that I&#039;d want some variety from honey, and tiramisu is not enough by itself.  Madeira keeps very well after the bottle is opened, so that might be the place to start.  

Mind you, gently chewing a liquorice twist might be quite enough, and a good deal cheaper, and perhaps wiser if you&#039;ve already had a drink or two  during the day.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: A few weeks ago I went to an all you can eat Japanese restaurant -- and it included all the sake I could drink. I just had one serving but that was enough to clearly disturb my sleep that night. There wasn&#039;t anything else unusual about the meal. I like to drink (in small amounts) but since then I have cut way down on drinking in the evening.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
