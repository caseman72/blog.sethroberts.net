		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Is it the yogurt or honey? The brain seems to like lactate. The brain can also store glycogen and it probably converts it to lactate (whether or not that is a good thing I don&#8217;t know, but healthy babies have elevated lactate levels besides the ketones, nonetheless it is still not clear whether lactate is an emergency substrate or preferred) However, the main components in different honey are fairly similar, the glucose and fructose part. If two different brands of honey have different effects, then we can more than likely eliminate the sugar component and look at other properties of various kinds of honey. Different kinds of honey have different antimicrobial properties and contaminants. A little hormesis to improve sleep? How does endotoxin impact sleep? (Personally, honey ruins my sleep even tiny amounts and so does sugar (sugar also negatively impacts my typing tests), I seem to sleep best when I eat about 600g of cottage cheese throughout the day, it&#8217;s probably less then that since I strain the fat out (I&#8217;m after the protein anyway, I eat plenty of butter and full fat yogurt), and beef which I like seems to make me sleepless if I eat it too late in the evening or too much of it during the day) [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Unless the tarp was rubber you would still be grounded.  Plus, since you were likely in the woods and somewhat remote, you would have been away from any EMF.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think the tarp was plastic. But I agree with you, I should not jump to conclusions about whether or not I was grounded. It does seem worth looking into. Maybe I slept especially well partly because I was away from light in the evening. The harder-than-usual surface (the ground) may have also helped.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, have you seen much discussion of the role that alcohol plays in poor sleep, particularly alcohol&#039;s role inhibiting gluconeogenesis (glucose secretion) in the liver? It could help explain, by its opposite, the role that sugar plays in honey&#039;s sleep-enhancing effect.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s a good point.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[#2 seems to lend even more credence to the prebiotic/probiotic hypothesis.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That honey acts as a prebiotic, increasing butyrate production and a bunch of other things? Yes, I agree, it supports that idea. I found one study where probiotics improved sleep:

		<description><![CDATA[Seth when you tried to repeat the effect on the second day, did you try another new honey that you hadn&#039;t had before? 
I actually think it&#039;s the increase in sugary foods that led to better sleep... But I have noticed improved sleep after trying new honey (but not on the second night) which is interesting

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No I used the same new honey as the first night. A &quot;first night&quot; effect is strange. I&#039;ll look for it next time I change honeys.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another alternate explanation: the honey effect is cumulative.  At least it seems that way to me.  On those nights that sleep is not as rich and deep, I can associate it with some external cause, such as when the bedroom was much colder than usual, or my wife was sleeping poorly.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;ve been taking honey at bedtime for at least a month. No reason the effect should suddenly get larger.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

What colors were the German and Canadian honeys?

(i just discovered there is actually a honey color scale/grader called the Pfund Scale)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The Canadian honey is lighter-colored and less viscous than the German honey.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
I can explain the camping effect.  You were grounded to the earth.  Look into grounding- its the best sleep hack of all.  I started with a grounded bracelet and graduated to a grounding sheet for my bed.  It plugs into the ground socket of a properly grounded electrical outlet.  It dissipates harmful EMF which normalizes nocturnal hormonal patterns.  It really is life changing.  Earthing.com sells the one that I have.  I do believe there are others vendors.  Look into it.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Very interesting. We slept on a tarp (inside sleeping bags, wearing clothes); would we still be grounded then? But your idea seems easy to test.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
