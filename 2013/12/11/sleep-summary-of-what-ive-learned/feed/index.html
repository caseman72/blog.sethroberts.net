		<description><![CDATA[@Baeo,
on the Choline &#039;thing&#039;, i was reading recently that choline (too much?) is not good for people prone to high histamine levels.
also choline needs to be in balance with inositol, so may be you are (or your diet is) deficient in inositol. &amp; apparently caffeine can produce an inositol deficiency.
just some food for thought...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For reference, I researched magnesium heavily.  Basically, if you have a magnesium deficiency, sleep problems  are only one of the many nasty effects -- constantly tense muscles are the most common.

If you have magnesium deficiency, you need to correct it by taking magnesium.  You can&#039;t be tested for magnesium deficiency by blood test because it doesn&#039;t &quot;hang out&quot; in the blood -- you can have a deficiency which can&#039;t be found in blood tests very easily.  And due to magnesium-depleted soil, it&#039;s become much easier to be magnesium-deficient than it was 100 years ago.

But if you don&#039;t have magnesium deficiency, magnesium will of course do nothing.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I live in Beijing half the year, Berkeley half the year. To my surprise, I seem to be healthier in Beijing, judging by brain test scores. I eat about the same food in both places. The reason may be that in Beijing I drink bottled water with magnesium added, in Berkeley the water I drink does not have magnesium added. I have tried magnesium supplements and they had no effect -- but that was in Beijing. Haven&#039;t tried them in Berkeley.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eggs seem to cause me horrible insomnia. 

Back around July 2012, I was trying to improve my diet but I didn&#039;t want to give up my vegetarianism, so I started to eat a LOT of eggs. The quantity varied a bit over time but was usually in the range of 10 to 14 per day. Not long after, I started having awful insomnia. I could lie awake all night just unable to fall asleep. There were suddenly just too many thoughts buzzing through my head keeping me up. It was like something was engaging my sympathetic nervous system. I thought it probably had something to do with my dietary changes, but I assumed that it was a result of ketosis disturbing sleep. I tried reintroducing carbs, but when that didn&#039;t work I just sort of gave up on dietary modifications (except for when I began supplementing Vitamin D in the morning, but that only helped marginally). I started cycling through OTC sleep aids, but that only sort of worked as I developed tolerance to anticholinergics very quickly and melatonin didn&#039;t work at all.

By October 2013, I was going crazy. I just couldn&#039;t sleep well. It was making me depressed and seriously impairing my academic performance. I was exhausted constantly, but then I noticed something. I slept better when I consumed a lot of caffeine in the morning. I played around with it a bit, and noticed that there was a clear dose dependent relationship between how much caffeine I consumed and how well I slept. Now, there are good reasons not to consume that much caffeine, but it got me looking in the right direction. I had a hunch that the caffeine was depleting my acetylcholine levels, serving a similar function as OTC anticholinergics like diphenhydramine and kava.

I wondered what would happen if I sharply reduced my intake of acetylcholine precursors. A lot of people advertise eggs as &quot;choline packed&quot;, so I cut back to less than 3 per day. Suddenly, I was sleeping much better. Now, it could be something else in the eggs (I&#039;m not really attached to my choline hypothesis), but either way I feel confident blaming them for my sleep troubles.. My insomnia is just gone now, and it returns whenever I start eating them again.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Great story.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always thought that coffee in the morning was safe. Calling it &quot;poison&quot; (see number 3 above) led me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7796154&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests otherwise. Too bad, it will be difficult to quit!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I have two cups of black tea in the morning. No more the rest of the day. Black tea has half the caffeine of coffee. After reading that study I may reduce it to 1 cup of black tea per day.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Any reasons on why no emphasis on Magnesium, I have tried it and found it effective for both muscle cramping and sleep.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: In small tests it made no difference. It is hard for magnesium to cross the blood brain barrier, which might have something to do with the negative results. Maybe I should try it again.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I take my Vitamin D3 at 8:00 am. I don&#039;t know if that is best but it seems to work. This has nothing to do with eating it with food -- I don&#039;t eat it with food.

I think Vitamin D3 has the same effect as sunlight -- I also try to get plenty of sunlight in the morning. I want those two things -- Vitamin D3 and sunlight -- to be working together, in synchrony. That will give me the greatest circadian rhythm amplitude and thus the deepest sleep. It&#039;s as if two people are pushing a swing; you&#039;d want their efforts to add rather than interfere. There&#039;s no substitute for trial and error in finding out what time it is best to take Vitamin D.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding oscillator number two - Bingo!  Some time ago I began experimenting with eating high protein breakfasts within 30 minutes of arising as a way to reduce snacking later in the day.  It worked admirably, but since I normally wake at 4AM for work, it didn&#039;t take long for me to start having problems with waking at 1:30 - 2AM - quite alert - and not be able to fall back to sleep until, of course, 3:55AM.

I was never aware of this affect, but I found the early waking subsided once I started skipping breakfast again.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Definitely supports what I found.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I just want to say again how much I appreciate your blog and what you give back to the community. Since reading your blog I have made significant improvements to my sleep and it has really benefited the rest of my life substantially. I can&#039;t remember if you&#039;ve discussed this before but I wonder if you have tried the philips blue light or anything similar. My routine now is that I use orange goggles starting around 8 pm, and then (after taking honey) read in bed with a red light. I find I can&#039;t read as long as I used to -- I get drowsy very quickly. Then in the morning I use a philips sunrise alarm clock (just started using it recently) to wake up and then a philips golite to expose myself to blue light while drinking my coffee and while shaving. Then I go to the park across the street and do some exercise (indian clubs or sprinting) while facing the sun (one of the benefits of living in Southern California). I have not been rigorous the way you have about teasing out the effects of these different measures, but I can say that overall my sleep is MUCH better than it used to be and I feel that this has improved my mood and my life considerably.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks, that&#039;s nice to hear. To answer your question, I put on orange goggles at 8 pm. Haven&#039;t tried the blue light.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article Seth. Magnesium hasn&#039;t helped me noticeably, but a cold room does. I sleep much worse in a hot room. 

A week of trying bedtime honey seemed to make me sleep slightly deeper, but push my sleep onset forward. Since I have sleep onset insomnia, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll keep with it.]]></description>
