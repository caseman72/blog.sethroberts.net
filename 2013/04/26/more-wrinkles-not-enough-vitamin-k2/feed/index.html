		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you&#039;ve talked a lot about the importance of Vitamin D3 for improved sleep.  I&#039;ve read that Vitamin K2 has a dramatic effect on how the body uses D3 --- but I&#039;ve only seen discussion of how it increases the D3&#039;s ability to help the body properly absorb calcium. Is there reason to believe that K2 might also help D3 in its role as &quot;improved sleep promoter&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is some confusion in the comments here about Vitamin K2 dosage which I would like to clear up... Simplified K2 comes in two forms, MK-4 which is synthesized by animals, and MK-7 which is synthesized by bacteria. MK-4 comes in MILLIgram dosages in the 1-15mg/range and MK-7 comes in MICROgram dosages 50-150mcg.

I don&#039;t have any evidence but I would posit it unwise to try take 5mg of MK-7! As always Stephan clears it up:

		<description><![CDATA[Updated my blog (link above) with some info about Vitamin K2 &amp; Bone health.

I have to admit, I scoured PubMed the other day looking for anything about Vitamin K2 &amp; skin health / wrinkles &amp; didn&#039;t come up with anything I thought was interesting. The article linked in the main post doesn&#039;t give enough of a citation of sources to track anything down.

She also asserts that women living in Japan, Bangkok, &amp; Shanghai are comparable in every way except their consumption of natto, which is absolutely not true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In terms of dosage when trying something new, I always tend to take the minimum dose to give my body time to adjust.  I read somewhere that you often need to find the minimum dose required to fix something - ie less is often more.  As these things also build up in your system over time.  Personally I usually take child dosages when I experiment because I may be sensitive to some additive that may be part of something I am trying for the first time , so its a quick way to test.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[5mg is really high-dose and part of my self-experimentation. Overdosing is quite unlikely, so given that 100mcg capsules cost more per dose than the 5mg ones, I shot for the latter. I&#039;ve read that Vitamin K2 MK4 has a very short half-life in serum (1-2 hours), so my idea was to have a dose that I only need to take once a day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see you posted 5mg, I take the Weston Price recommended Fermented Butter/Cod liver Oil, only one cap at night.  It recommends 2 a day.  I have always had good skin which needs looking after as the climate I now live in is different and the water here is much harder, dosages would vary according to how our bodies absorbed, and upon our deficiency and need of K2?]]></description>
