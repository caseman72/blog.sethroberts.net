		<description><![CDATA[Difficult to interprete data indeed. But after reading the original article I have to disagree with a few of your points: 

&gt; 3. There is no simple connection between diabetes and obesity. 
&gt; During the economic crisis, when the prevalence of obesity 
&gt; went down by half (from 15% to 7%) and exercise greatly 
&gt; increased, the prevalence of diabetes slightly increased. Only 
&gt; after the crisis did the usual correlation (more obesity, more 
&gt; diabetes) emerge.
This is true for prevalence - but not for incidence. I.e. people were not cured from diabetes, but fewer got sick. This shows up clearly. 

&gt; 2. A graph showing rates of heart disease, cancer, 
&gt; and stroke (the three main killers) over the period 
&gt; showed no change in rates of cancer and stroke. 
There is no graph showing the rates of these diseases - the graph shows the mortality attributed to these diseases. Makes a big difference when thinking about whether the &quot;time lag&quot; hypothesis is believable (inho it is for mortality much more than for prevalance). But also making it even more difficult to interpret the data, because changes in treatment for these conditions (e.g. treatment for high blood pressure) could also affect the mortality by a lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I say garbage, I mean it is positively harmful. Not that there aren&#039;t benefits from exercise, but people who are sedentary are probably unhealthy, and therefore need to be sedentary, aka rest. Telling them to exercise expends or overexpends their limited energy resources, preventing them from taking actions that would actually make them healthier, such as improving diet and environment, getting more sleep, or whatever. Given the many documented positive effects of smoking, it is likely that the correlation between sick people and smoking is similar to the correlation between sick people and being sedentary.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As another example, there is much talk about how a sedentary lifestyle is bad, but my own observation is that a sedentary lifestyle has no impact on my health. At most, modest exercise when healthy is nice but not necessary, and overtraining is quite bad. Instead, I have observed a very strong correlation between being sick and being sedentary, with the causation running the other way. Therefore I conclude the epidemiological emphasis on the health benefits of exercise for the non-obese is mostly garbage. Rather, when one is healthy one will naturally not be sedentary, in the sense of at least walking around, up stairs, etc. The only exception would be extremely long working hours at a desk. If humans are adapted to long periods of inactivity during e.g. winter, then evolutionary biology supports my conclusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The origination of the theory in three countries does not mean the theory is correct in three countries. Furthermore, this is a logical fallacy: 

&quot;but one would need to come up with a hypothesis as well supported and biologically plausible as the smoking hypothesis.&quot;

I certainly do have my own hypotheses, better informed than those here, but I do not need to advance them. I am content to shred the logical errors of the defenders of the status quo view, which I have done. That nobody has offered evidence to alter my opinions strengthens my estimation of their accuracy.

It is precisely this sort of thinking that has permitted the fat theory of obesity to dominate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The cancer-causing properties of smoking were first discovered in pre-war Germany.  Apparently those abroad who noticed the results rejected them on the grounds that they probably were just pandering to Hitler&#039;s dislike of smoking.  So the study that changed everything was a postwar British one by Bradford Hill and Doll.  At the very least, then, you have to explain why smoking apparently mows down Krauts and Brits and Yanks.  

I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if smoking affects different races differently, even races as similar as, say, Germans and Italians.  Even if one accepted the idiocy that race is just a social construct, one could look at habits - including diet - that varied among, say, the European nations, but one would need to come up with a hypothesis as well supported and biologically plausible as the smoking hypothesis.  Still, never say never, eh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I recall correctly, the cancer smoking connection looks compelling when you take a naive look at American epidemiology snapshot, but fails to hold when looking at time series or international comparisons, as you partially discovered with Cuba. The &quot;1/d healthy, 2 packs/d unhealthy&quot; hypotheses *really* doesn&#039;t fit the international data, since other countries tend to smoke much more than the US, yet have far less cancer. The data fits a melanoma type hypothesis much better - American doctors rightly tell Americans to stay out of the sun, but sun doesn&#039;t actually cause cancer for more paleo countries or for people eating more paleo diets. Quite the opposite, sun is actually healthy. This would explain why animals who smoke live longer in properly controlled experiments. 

&quot;Apparently, arsenic causes cancer in humans but not in animals.&quot;

Key word, apparently. What you should have said is there is a correlation between arsenic exposure in humans and cancer. I have no information about whether this correlation is reliable enough to be considered established without any controlled experiments to back the causal link.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;well, as well-supported as it can be in the inevitable absence of controlled experiment on humans.&quot;

False, it is not established by controlled studies in animals, as I have stated. 

For example, it could be that there&#039;s something generally carcinogenic in the USA, and the bloodflow stimulating effects of tobacco merely grow the tumors faster in the lungs compared to other parts of the body. Or that tobacco alone doesn&#039;t cause cancer, but only in combination with some aspect of the American diet. It could be like sunshine and melanoma - if in other places in the world people get lots of sun without getting skin cancer. 

There is no way it is a very well established medical fact, UNLESS someone can provide a simple animal study proving causation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) &quot;I thought that the harmfulness of smoking was about as well-supported as any medical hypothesis can be&quot;: well, as well-supported as it can be in the inevitable  absence of controlled experiment on humans.

2) Eightfold, Adam; wouldn&#039;t it depend on how much he smoked?  And for how long?  The rule I&#039;ve seen quoted says that the 25-a-day smoker increases his risk of contracting lung cancer 25-fold.  (Or perhaps that refers to his risk of dying of lung cancer: my memory isn&#039;t clear on that.)  How many years he has to smoke to qualify for &quot;the rule of 25&quot; also escapes my memory.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1) &#8220;I thought that the harmfulness of smoking was about as well-supported as any medical hypothesis can be&#8221;: well, as well-supported as it can be in the inevitable  absence of controlled experiment on humans.</p>
<p>2) Eightfold, Adam; wouldn&#8217;t it depend on how much he smoked?  And for how long?  The rule I&#8217;ve seen quoted says that the 25-a-day smoker increases his risk of contracting lung cancer 25-fold.  (Or perhaps that refers to his risk of dying of lung cancer: my memory isn&#8217;t clear on that.)  How many years he has to smoke to qualify for &#8220;the rule of 25&#8243; also escapes my memory.  But the lack of any allusion to the extent of smoking in your quotation makes me leery of it.  And as for its source, I just guffawed at &#8220;It first appeared on the Journal of Theoretics&#8221;.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting read here: http://smokescreens.org/lungcancer.htm

&quot;Based upon what the media and anti-tobacco organizations say, one would think that if you smoke, you get lung cancer (a 100% correlation) or at least expect a 50+% occurrence before someone uses the word &#039;cause.&#039; 

Would you believe that the real number is &lt; 10% (see Appendix A)? Yes, a US white male (USWM) cigarette smoker has an 8% lifetime chance of dying from lung cancer but the USWM nonsmoker also has a 1% chance of dying from lung cancer (see Appendix A).  In fact, the data used is biased in the way that it was collected and the actual risk for a smoker is probably less.&quot;

Haven&#039;t fact checked the numbers, but if true, it is interesting.]]></description>

Now you have reason to suspect that it is not, and apparently that&#039;s as far as it will go with you, which I&#039;m fine with. Anyone else who wishes to provide a pdf proving causal link is welcome to do so.]]></description>
