Interesting. Aren&#039;t there a lot of free glutamates in things like kelp and fermented foods? What are the implications of that vs. its use as an additive?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Kirsten,
    I am one of the practitioners who has seen the tremendous effect of which you speak:  Many autoimmune conditions respond to healing and reconditioning the flora of the gut.  I attended the event that Seth hosted last night, and am very inspired by people looking to heal themselves.  I had to heal myself as well.
    I would love to get to know you better, as a colleague.  Feel free to connect on LinkedIn (T. Bergenn) and/or Facebook (Ti Bergenn)

Best to you with Hashimoto&#039;s -- we&#039;ll keep learning and keep healing!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth-- I&#039;ve been reading your blog for years--was briefly a member of the SLD forums in about 2007--and appreciate the mindset of looking into things yourself rather than leaving it the hands of doctors. As my husband likes to say: No one will care about your money (or health, or time, etc.) as much as you do.

Which is maybe why, when I was diagnosed with Hashimotos thyroiditis last fall, I started looking into alternatives. The standard medical prognosis is depressing--Hashis is an auto-immune condition, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid. Standard treatment is to give thyroid medicine to support the diminished organ. You feel better, then the immune system (which is trying to save your life, after all) mounts an even bigger attack. So they increase the dose--and so on until the thyroid gives out and you require thyroid hormone supplements for the rest of your life.

I lived through one cycle of that, and it was miserable. Plus, once you have one auto-immune condition, you&#039;re likely to develop others. So I started looking--and sure enough, there a group that believes auto-immune conditions start with a damaged gut, and if you heal the gut (and replace good bacteria) you can calm the auto-immune attack. I&#039;m a member of a Facebook page called Hashimotos 411 that has more than 5000 members from all around the world, all following the protocol to some degree. i also help moderate a sub-group, the Elimination/Provocation Diet, which has about 1000 members. (Feel free to look us up!) Different things work for different people, but there are some large commonalities: often natural desiccated thyroid works better for people than synthetic medicine, and often people feel much better when they go on an elimination diet using the auto immune protocol (which removes common auto-immune triggering foods), to start pinpointing their food sensitivities. Certain supplements seem to work for a lot of people, and people seem to have common sensitivities.

Anyway, the page is full of people who&#039;ve been scoffed at by doctors--&quot;There&#039;s no such thing as adrenal fatigue&quot; or &quot;Natural thyroid hormone is impossible to dose and will give you heart attacks.&quot; Meanwhile, people go on self-experimenting and sharing their findings. In my case, I started on the auto-immune protocol diet in November and by mid-February my blood tests were showing my auto-immune antibodies within normal range--so, for all practical purposes, the condition was in remission. And based on my labs, my doctor recommended that I step down my thyroid medication by 20%.

I&#039;m not out of the woods yet. I&#039;ve spent the last three months fighting a distressing and completely unexplainable weight gain....until today I traced it (I think) to a probiotic which, it turns out, has dairy and soy. Those of us with damaged guts will often have out-of-proportion reactions to foods or chemicals...but they&#039;re signs of what we should avoid.

Anyway, thought you&#039;d be interested to know about a large self-experimenting community that&#039;s having a lot of success self-treating an otherwise untreatable auto-immune disease.
