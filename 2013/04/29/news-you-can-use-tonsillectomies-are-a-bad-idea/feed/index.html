		<description><![CDATA[I noticed this article about ADHD maybe being caused by sleep deprivation.  This part is interesting:   A full half of the original A.D.H.D. group who received tonsillectomies — 11 of 22 children — no longer met the criteria for the condition. In other words, what had appeared to be A.D.H.D. had been resolved by treating a sleeping problem.
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/opinion/sunday/diagnosing-the-wrong-deficit.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=1&amp;utm_source=feedly&amp;

Any thoughts?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It&#039;s an excellent article. A new and persuasive idea that I hadn&#039;t heard before. That the author himself had sleep &amp; ADHD-like problems partly explains its excellence, I think.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
