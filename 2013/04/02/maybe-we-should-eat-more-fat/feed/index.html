		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Another reason I trust what I found the fact that people like the taste of fat. That evolution has shaped us to like the taste of something we shouldn’t eat makes no sense.&quot;

As much as I want to believe this, Seth, there are other possibilities:
1. Prehistoric man only had access to small amounts of animal fat.  Maybe small amounts are good for you but the amounts we can obtain nowadays are unhealthy.

2. Animal is actually very good for you until age 60 (for instance).  Maybe eating a lot of animal fat makes you more likely to have a heart attack at age 60 and beyond; this would have made no difference to prehistoric man.

What do you think?  I&#039;d love to be wrong about this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More accurately the book states that there is no known bliss point for fat up to heavy cream. It mentions that a couple of times but doesn&#039;t really emphasize it.

		<description><![CDATA[Nancy:

Agreed.  I do drink heavy cream alone, often an entire pint, and have for months.

There is certainly a &quot;bliss point.&quot;  My consistent experience has been that it leaves me both incredibly full and sated, for quite a number of hours.  After which point I can hardly imagine eating another thing.  What one would expect from 190g of saturated fat, albeit in only two cups.

If anything I suspect the fat concoction fed to those individuals is not fatty enough.  Not so much because they are fat deprived, but likely because the levels of saturated fat considered &quot;safe&quot; are absurdly low (and therefore who would venture such a thing?)

Also, the note about cheese is absurd.  Cheese is hardly pure fat or anywhere close to it; even many &quot;high fat&quot; cheeses are mostly protein.

Again, fat-is-scary relativism at work.  In a world of adequate fat consumption, cheese is a low fat product.  In the world of ultra-conservative guidelines, it is notably scary as a fatty food additive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Ms. Lebovitz.  Mr. Moss&#039; test for the &quot;bliss&quot; point for fat was flawed because he added sugar to the mix - and I think he added sugar because he knew that when eating pure fat, even delicious fat such as butter, one reaches a saturation point fairly quickly, and that would undermine the point he was trying to make.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, do you know of any plant fats that might have comparably beneficial effects?  I know that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/29/the-buttermind-experiment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Buttermind&lt;/a&gt; experiment suggested that coconut fat didn&#039;t compare favorably to butter.  But I wonder if there are any other type of plant-derived  fats or oils that may be promising.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I can&#039;t think of any plant fats that resemble animal fats. They would need to be solid at room temperature -- which wouldn&#039;t work well for a plant.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
