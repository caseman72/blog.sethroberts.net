		<description><![CDATA[I think that Chris Masterjohn wrote the most interesting dissection of this TMAO study here: http://www.westonaprice.org/blogs/cmasterjohn/2013/04/10/does-carnitine-from-red-meat-contribute-to-heart-disease-through-intestinal-bacterial-metabolism-to-tmao/

Seth: I didn&#039;t link to this discussion because I disagreed with its main points. For example, Chris says that fish has much more TMAO than meat. But since TMAO is made from the carnitine in meat, this does not mean that fish causes more TMAO inside the body than meat -- which is what matters. Another example is that Chris complains that the mice experiments involved meat dosages that resembled eating 100 steaks per day. He said that was unrealistic. Because of the vast lifespan differences between mice and people, I don&#039;t dismiss this experiment. I don&#039;t think it is obvious what the &quot;equivalent&quot; number of steaks is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed, the association with cardio disease is weak at best. The association with colorectal cancer is much stronger, but even there, you have a lot of confounding variables (potentially) to consider: method and degree of cooking, fat content, etc. I&#039;m not worried about the carnitine nonsense so much as I am about heterocyclic amines, on which the literature is vast. HCAs are scary.

Japan is a country of skinny people. France not quite so much, but compared to the U.S., French are lightweights. Low BMI is the route to low CVD.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I explain the thinness of people in Japan and France as partly due to a gourmet strain -- good taste in food. They eat little &quot;ditto food&quot;. There are few McDonald&#039;s in Tokyo, for example. I think this goes along with a taste for fermented food.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Paul N: from where do you get the idea that the French and Japanese use less antibiotics? You must not know much about those countries. 

Also, Seth, why change your diet to include wholemeal bread? whatever you&#039;ve been doing till now appears to be working given you lowered your coronary calcium score fairly dramatically...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The fermented foods eaten in Japan and France also have lots of vitamin K2, which is known to help prevent heart disease.

Of course, eating fermented foods also helps with gut flora, b vitamins and a few other benefits.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2013/04/lessons-from-the-latest-red-meat-scare/#comments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Paul Jaminet&lt;/a&gt; has written a good response to that last study on TMAO.

The major standout, to me was that once they gave the participants antibiotics, to kill their gut bacteria,  and then &quot;rebuilt&quot; their gut flora, the TMAO levels increased *seven fold* compared to before.

So is the problem carnitine, or disordered gut bacteria?

The French and Japanese use less antibiotics and, from the fermented foods, have much better gut bacteria (and both eat far less &quot;factory foods&quot;)

Small wonder they are much healthier.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From my perspective, the authors of this study immediately lost all credibility based on their interpretation of the results from the recent Med diet trial... It was either a very disingenuous way to support their own conclusions, or they have no idea how to interpret randomized trials.  I suspect it was the former.  In that trial,BOTH groups were counseled to avoid red meat, so it was in no way a randomized test of the red meat hypothesis like the Cleveland Clinic authors contend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; &quot; ... the telling fact about heart disease is that it is very low in both Japan and France, much lower than in countries with high rates of heart disease. &quot; &lt;/i&gt;
