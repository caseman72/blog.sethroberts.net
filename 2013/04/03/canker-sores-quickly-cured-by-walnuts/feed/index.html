&quot;Are the people who do see improvement from increasing omega-3 actually deficient in omega-3 as such, or do they need more omega-3 to correct an underlying state of inflammation? &quot;

I&#039;m sure there are many cases where the underlying inflammation is the cause.  Wheat/gluten (or soy) causing trouble is a good example - does any amount of omega 3 make wheat &quot;safe&quot; - probably not.  

SO, if you are eating toxins, omega 3 might mitigate some or even all of the effects, but better to remove the toxins first.

Similarly for other deficiencies, like magnesium, or (especially) K2, omega 3 can only do so much.

The current fad where fish oil is being sold as a cure all is, in many cases, simply creating &quot;licensing&quot; behaviour, where people continue to eat badly, but think its OK because they are taking fish oil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like others I found my lifelong canker sores (or mouth ulcers as we call them in the UK) stopped when I stopped eating gluten. That was three years ago and the only ones I&#039;ve had since have followed accidental gluten ingestion. Prior to this I was eating a broadly Weston Price style diet (including oily fish and cod liver oil) for several years; if there was any improvement on moving to this from a standard &#039;healthy&#039; western diet it was modest - I wasn&#039;t looking for and don&#039;t recall noticing any significant change.

Are the people who do see improvement from increasing omega-3 actually deficient in omega-3 as such, or do they need more omega-3 to correct an underlying state of inflammation? Are they eating diets generally deficient in omega-3 compared to people who never get canker sores?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I think as a matter of definition if eating more omega-3 cures canker sores then you were deficient in omega-3. That&#039;s how deficiency is usually defined. I see your point, however, which is that even if omega-3 cures the canker sores there may be other ways to improve matters.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Seth: When you started paleo, did you increase or decrease or leave unchanged your omega-3 intake?

Increased n-3 pretty significantly. Eating about a pound of salmon a week, sardines, some supplementation (LEF Mega EPA/DHA)... about 3-4g/day of n-3 and less than 10g of n-6 according to Chron-o-meter.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. Supports more omega-3 --&gt; fewer canker sores idea.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been 3 months in SLD and my jaw just hit the floor.

Since I was a kid I have always suffered of painful canker sores. I&#039;ve been having them all my life...

But now that I&#039;m reading this, I realized I haven&#039;t had any canker sore in my 3 months doing SLD. 

I have been taking 4 tablespoons of canola oil a day. I was careful to choose a brand with more omega-3 than others.

I am very impressed and happy :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Walnuts are also a good source of folate, iron and zinc - no B-12. Even though they have the highest level of n-3 than any other nut, they have four times higher omega-6. 

However: &quot;Along with omega-3 fatty acids, walnuts contain ellagic acid. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center reports that ellagic acid contains antiviral and antibiotic properties and is now found to have anticancer properties as well.&quot; - via Livestrong.

So it could be the antiviral and/or the antibiotic properties at work here. Or a combination of all of the above.

		<description><![CDATA[Walnuts are also high in omega-6.  And didn&#039;t you blog before that walnuts didn&#039;t help your sleep or brain activity, or something? I could be misremembering...

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Right. Eating walnuts did not help me. Nor did it help 3 of my students. In each case, the measurements were brain-related. Perhaps brain-related measurements are more sensitive to omega-6 content than canker sores. It&#039;s also possible that if you begin an experiment high in omega-3, walnuts have a different effect than if you begin low in omega-3.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
