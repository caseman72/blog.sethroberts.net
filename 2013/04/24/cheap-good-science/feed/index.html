		<description><![CDATA[Once again, cheap science proves superior: Now that the West is forced to seek alternatives to expensive antibiotics whose use has produced supergerms and helped drive up medical costs, it is looking at old-fashioned Russian bacteriophage therapy. Phage therapy is cheaper and &quot;far more robust to heat&quot; (http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2006/09/30/phage-therapy), can adapt to changing bacteria http://www.bacteriophagetherapy.info/ECF40946-8E2F-4890-9CA6-D390A26E39C1/Pros%20and%20cons%20of%20phage%20therapy.html, is more targeted and less likely to cause side effects or resistance, and is equally effective and in some cases more so, but more difficult to mass-manufacture (and thus not favored by corporations). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy, http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89380684, http://www.npr.org/2013/04/12/177029253/looking-to-nature-for-antibiotic-inspirations]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe your work and discoveries, just like Hong are very inspirational. You share information and new knowledge to everyone around the globe with the use of the Internet. It sends a message that every individual has the potential to contribute something to society even with no or limited budget. We now have the Internet which we can use to publicize our work without any payment.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;It sends a message that every individual has the potential to contribute something to society even with no or limited budget.&quot; I agree, thank you. From my privileged position, I think I tend to miss this point. People want to improve their own health, of course. Economists endlessly discuss self-interest. My work shows a new way of improving one&#039;s own health. But people also want to contribute something to society, just as you say -- which is not so obvious, at least to economists. My work shows a new way of doing this, too. I am impressed with the work of Adam Grant, which shows that if you can make a job appear more helpful to others, people like doing that job more. Making a job seem more helpful to others is quite different than increasing how much the job helps the person doing it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love Hong Yi&#039;s work, her ability to imagine amazes me, and inspires - almost like a child who sees patterns in everything and plays with it all.  I always notice patterns and shapes in nature and the effects of light and shade.  This desire for pattern, design and insight is linked to curiosity and play - isn&#039;t that also part of this desire to re-design our selves whether its through sleep, eating, walking, socialising - its the desire to discover new ways of being in the world.  Maybe we should call it &#039;curious science of self creation through feedback&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link to Hong Yi.

Here&#039;s her blog:
http://www.ohiseered.com/

So good natured, and I got a good laugh from the uplifting photos and commentary. The use of materials is original. 

I get the feeling she&#039;s at one with the world of marketing. Maybe she&#039;s a natural behavioural psychologist. I&#039;ll have to think about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whether you know it or not, you and Hong Yi are exact opposites. She is most certainly an insider in the art world (or at least wants to be). One look at her architecture models is enough to tell you that.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Have you looked at my animal-learning papers?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks. That&#039;s a good way of putting it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You may be leaving out up-front costs-- Hong&#039;s Yi&#039;s learning to draw well and your background in statistics.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t think my statistics background has made much difference. But you&#039;re right there are &quot;infrastructure&quot; costs. I&#039;m not sure that Hong Yi needed to draw well to produce her work.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
