		<description><![CDATA[Kaleberg, it seems to be different if the loss of smell is temporary versus a sense you never had.

The weight loss happened over three weeks. Six pounds in three weeks would be pretty good for a weight-loss plan. It was remarkable for an unintentional loss. If I didn&#039;t read this blog I probably wouldn&#039;t have made the connection.

Coincidentally, my young daughter and adult sister are anosmic as well. My sister has generally been slim. It will be interesting to see how my daughter&#039;s anosmia affects her weight in adulthood. I am teaching her to practice personal science, so we may be getting some reports from her in a decade or two.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
Have you seen this article about smell and weight loss?
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/18/fashion/18skin.html?_r=0

Also, It would be very interesting to hear an update on your current implementation of the Shangri-la diet. Do you do oil or sugar? Has your weight stayed low? Do you see other health benefits related to the weight loss?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I noseclip a bunch of foods, including cheese and yogurt with honey and ground flaxseed. I&#039;m a lot more muscular than I used to be so weight comparisons are misleading. I didn&#039;t see health benefits from weight loss -- I wasn&#039;t particularly fat to begin with.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
