		<description><![CDATA[@Rein,
thanks for your find. One should be aware of potential pitfalls. eg http://www.xylitol.org/questions-about-xylitol
Is xylitol toxic to dogs?

Many dog owners are aware that chocolate, coffee, and grapes are toxic to dogs, but are aware of the risk from ingesting the common natural sweetener, xylitol? Xylitol is a natural sweetener that is found in a variety of products, including chewing gum, toothpaste, mints, floss, candy, chewable vitamins, and sugar-free baked goods. While xylitol offers many health benefits to humans, it can be deadly to dogs and should not be fed to any pets.

Ingesting 100 milligram of xylitol per kilogram of bodyweight may cause a rapid release of the hormone insulin, causing a sudden decrease in blood glucose (potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia, low blood sugar) for dogs. The drop in blood sugar occurs within 15 minutes, while the symptoms of hypoglycemia (vomiting, depression, loss of coordination, seizures, or coma are all possible symptoms) may be seen within 30 minutes after the dog consumes the xylitol-containing product. Exposure to higher doses of xylitol may possibly result in fatal liver failure in some dogs

An cautionary note is sounded by this person who points to diet as a factor in out of balance oral cavity flora.

		<description><![CDATA[i have been reading about Xylitol for a while and even recently saw that a new sweet containing Xylitol was going to be launched in the UK stores to prevent teeth infections.  After reading the article above, when we went away this weekend I thought I would try to find some Xylitol gum while I was out shopping.  I found Smints which contain xylitol, I kept taking a small mint after a meal or a drink over the weekend.  Friday I noticed a small ulcer causing irritation on the inside of my mouth. Without making any connection after popping Smints with xylitol on Saturday and one before bed, on the the drive back home on Sunday I noticed my ulcer had gone!  completely.  Now that was weird!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always try to find some negatives on a good story. On this story I found it here:

http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/xylitol-not-as-sweet-as-its-cracked-up-to-be/

At least it raises some points about the manufacturing and sources for Xylitol that users should be aware of.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Good idea, thanks.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suffered from gum disease and cavities from my teen year until a couple of years ago. The progression seemed to get worse when I moved to the USA in 1999. 

Then I switched dentists and they did (at some considerable cost to myself) an oral DNA analysis, which revealed a number of pathogens, including what they considered the &#039;bad&#039; one which was an anaerobic bacteria that buries into the gums and does bad things. They gave me a bunch of antibiotics and 3 monthly cleanings and the progression halted and the gums became less inflamed.

Then I became aware of two bits of information, first about omega-3 and gum health from this blog, and secondly about the way anaerobic bacteria in the gut can&#039;t metabolize saturated fats (with downstream consequences). So switching my diet to (as far as is possible) saturated fats, with the exception of a shot glass of flax seed oil in the mornings (omega-3) and in the following two years my pockets improves and my gum inflammation went away entirely. 

The response from my hygienist has been most interesting - her: &quot;I see you&#039;ve been really on top of your cleaning and flossing&quot;. Me: &quot;No, I rarely brush and never floss, I just followed up on some inflammation research and switched to saturated fats and some omega-3s in my diet.&quot;. She didn&#039;t want to hear any more and has stopped talking about it. I assume the mental dissonance was too great for her.

My only regret is that I changed multiple variables at a time, so it&#039;s hard to know whether all or a subset of those interventions was the primary cause of the improvement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have geographic tongue too. I&#039;ve been taking Zinc supplements with some success (going out and getting some sun seems to help some too).

I wonder if it is a combination of not getting enough sun which caused a deficiency in Zinc which allowed some bacteria to over populate my tongue. I would have to do some research, but it is a hypothesis to start with! I also, haven&#039;t been drinking enough water which caused painful fissures on my fingers.

I&#039;ll have to try the Zylitol too. I had been using it a little big as I was doing Ellie Phillips regime, but I haven&#039;t been consistent with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have had geographic tongue all my life for which I was told there was nothing wrong and nothing to be done....really?  Occasionally have had very bad bouts of painful lesions on the tongue which have recently been diagnosed as &quot;burning mouth syndrome&quot; for which I was told there is no cure...nothing can be done...really?  It has (so far) almost completely abated using xylitol as part of regime by a dentist I found via comments on the Paleohacks website.  http://www.drellie.com/Ellie-Phillips-My-Recommendations.php
The funny thing is I had just been using Xylitol while waiting to find a couple of her other recommendations.  So far, the lesions are gone and the tongue is almost normal.  Her regime is part of an overall oral health/cavity free goal.  Everything can be purchased at a Walgreens. I may never need to see a dentist again.]]></description>
