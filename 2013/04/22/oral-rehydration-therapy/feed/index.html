		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
Your comment about medical and law schools reminded me of a conversation I had with one of my law school professors.  He had gone to an Ivy League law school, and then into private practice (big NY law firm) for three years.  He said that if he had stayed at the law firm any longer, his resume would have been &quot;tainted,&quot; and it would have been difficult for him to get a job as a law professor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I dispense ORT regularly as a pharmacist, but I often see what you mention too - doctors prescribing IV fluids, IV antiemetics, etc. Although we haven&#039;t had a case at my place of work, a local Chinese pharmacist told me she has seen Dystonias (uncontrollable muscle tightening, similar to a seizure) in a child treated with these anti-nausea medications. Sometimes simple is better.]]></description>

My tentative theory is that science fiction readers (me and probably a large majority of my commenters) are likely to pick up odd facts, even before the internet.

		<description><![CDATA[Dena, it is not quite that simple. The ratio of salts is important. Water on its own won&#039;t work. If there is too much sugar it will make the diarrhea worse. Too much salt is really bad. For instance, sports drinks have too much sugar and won&#039;t work.

When I had diarrhea recently I just drank Pedialyte. It is interesting to note that they don&#039;t seem to make anything targeted at adults although as far as I can see there is nothing child-specific in Pedialyte.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FWIW, I came across oral rehydration therapy in a BBC World Service broadcast. Noticed it immediately, because the long words were in such stark contrast to the simple meaning: &quot;drink water. With salts/sugar melted in.&quot; 

I&#039;m pretty sure this was more than a decade ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Addendum. 

Here are a couple of TV commercials.

This one is a 30 seconds cartoon with a cherished Mexican character, Cantinflas. This aired in the 80&#039;s He explains how to use the serum and how it can save a kid&#039;s life. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY9hVRknI3M

Here is a 2:30 minutes commercial with a little more info. This one is from the 90&#039;s. http://youtu.be/LF8g8oVOQm4?t=7s]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ORT in Mexico is very popular and fully endorsed by the government. It&#039;s even in our law. Heres the Official Mexican Norm for Children&#039;s Health (In Spanish). http://www.salud.gob.mx/unidades/cdi/nom/031ssa29.html

If you go to a public clinic you can get packets with a powder to prepare serum at home, for free. It&#039;s called Suero Vida Oral (Oral Life Serum) and it saves countless lives a year.

Over the years, since I have memory, there have been very aggressive health marketing campaigns. Now everyone knows where to get the serum and how to use it.

Here&#039;s a PDF of a flyer you&#039;d find in public elementary schools and clinics. http://www.promocion.salud.gob.mx/dgps/descargas1/programas/1_postal_vida_suero_oral_dgps.pdf

It&#039;s a surprise to me that this hasn&#039;t been implemented in other countries.
