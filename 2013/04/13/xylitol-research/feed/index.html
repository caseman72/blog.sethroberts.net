		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seth: Yeah, very interesting. How much other really useful health information has failed to spread…&quot;

There&#039;s probably some network analysis to be done here. I imagine ideas from the centre (Harvard, say) quickly propagate everywhere, while ideas from the periphery (Univ. Helsinki) usually remain at the periphery. A few,  but only a few, may make it upstream to the centre.

I also have a theory that linguistic and political barriers (semi-permeable barriers, that is) may foster innovation by sheltering research and innovation communities from the forces of centralization.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just wondering if all the Ellie Philipps mentions could be spam on this post and your previous one? It would be easy to do if one had a Google alert for xylitol or something. So far we got her websites, her recommendations and her book under 10 comments?

I&#039;ve been using xylitol for about two months now 4x/day for around 2 tsp total a day. My gum bleeding didn&#039;t get any better at the time of this comment.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Phillips has been by far the biggest American promoter of xylitol. You might want to try flaxseed oil for the gum bleeding.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I only ever chew Spry gum. Check it out.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I got some Spry gum, too. But it is easier to use xylitol as a sweetener in tea and yogurt.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is this not widely known in the US? In Scandinavia we have been chewing xylitol gum for &gt;30 years already because of these studies. Strange how it hasn&#039;t apparently spread.
