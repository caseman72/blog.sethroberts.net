		<description><![CDATA[So what did cause the long-term doubling of life expectancy in England from 32 in 1680 to 65 in 1942? There is general agreement that medicine was not responsible and that the major factor was better resistance to disease, and that the only thing that could have made this possible was better nutrition. 

How much has modern medicine contributed to the increase in life expectancy? The answer seems to be about 20 per cent, much less than improved nutrition and improved sanitation. 

It is easy to adopt a patronizing attitude to those patients who, from 425 BC to 1865, imagined their doctors were doing them good when they were only doing them harm. But we too are credulous. We owe much less to modern medicine than we can imagine

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: In addition to better nutrition, there were big improvements in public hygiene, e.g., cleaner water. It became a lot safer to live in a city.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
