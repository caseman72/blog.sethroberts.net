Another magpie for intelligent articles is Barry Ritholtz at The Big Picture. He&#039;s on the finance side, but benevolent scepticism works from every angle.

BBC R4 had a good piece today on statins and &quot;treating risk&quot; in the medical industry:

In the UK we regularly get newspaper headlines: Why O Why Won&#039;t the Government Pay For Statins? The radio show makes the point that, to flog product, disease awareness campaigns in the UK are probably as effective as direct marketing of drugs in the US.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The SRI article is really quite interesting, and it prompts me to think of another difference between personal and professional science.

That is, does the result lead to to something that is sellable/patentable?

It is a common evaluation criteria for grant funding &quot;will this lead to any patentable results?&quot;  So this automatically biases project creation and selection to things that create controllable intellectual property, rather than just things that create useful results.

But Laulanié&#039;s method could not be patented or controlled, or sold, in any way, so why would any professional scientist pursue it, or any government fund it, if it can&#039;t be &quot;sold&quot; to the world?

And, potentially, it goes against the interest of corporations that fund agricultural research.  Who benefits, other than the farmers themselves, from a method change that increases yield with no new seed varieties and no use of fertilisers or pesticides?

Personal science is pretty much about results above all else.
Increasingly, professional science uses results as a pathway to &quot;all else&quot;.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Very true. Professional scientists, however, are not particularly interested in selling things, although their funders may be. Leaving aside the influence of their funders, professional scientists have a big problem: they get most or all of their status from their job. And two things are true: useless is higher status than useful, making it hard for them to do useful research; and big (= expensive) is higher status than small (= cheap), making it hard for them to do small research. Laulanié wasn&#039;t worried about status. Most people are.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
