		<description><![CDATA[&quot;you should start putting grass-fed butter in your morning coffee&quot;: thank you for the suggestion, but when I want a morning treat I add double cream to my coffee.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I have used both (butter and cream) many times in my morning tea. Cream is better but butter is adequate.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I often notice a delayed positive effect of high amounts of tallow or butter.  If I eat a lot, I actually get sort of queasy, but hours later I feel good.  During exercise, my face and extremities become warm, and I can handle much more volume (my recovery during high fat eating is improved as well--weightlifting and ballet), from both an increase in motivation and decrease in fatigue.]]></description>

You are everywhere!
I&#039;ve been seeing your comments for years on the blogs I have found most interesting at various stages; CiF, Chris Dillow, CynicusEconomicus, Marginal Revolution (or is it Money Illusion?) and FOFOA (?) 

When you&#039;re ready to give up the toast (gluten) and marmalade (sugar) maybe you should start putting grass-fed butter in your morning coffee
