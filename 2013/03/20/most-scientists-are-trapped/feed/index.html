		<description><![CDATA[Thanks again, Seth. I will try to increase animal fat intake; this might be a challenge for me, paleo but pescatarian.  One-legged standing did not work for me, though I cannot say I continued doing it after a couple of weeks. I have taken 10k IU of D3 (Solger) almost every day for months but it has not changed my sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Update: unfortunately, more Natural Calm (magnesium citrate) in afternoon and before bed, delaying 1st coffee 2.5 hours, and increasing exercise and 1st-in-AM sunlight (plus 6000K light, albeit only 45W) has had no effect on the early awakening. Usually I only have 1/2 to 1-1/2 cups of coffee in a day, and typically I have no trouble falling sleep at first, so I doubt eliminating the remaining coffee will solve the problem.  I am developing n=1 fatigue.... :)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You might try: 1. eating more animal fat. 2. one-legged standing. 3. Vitamin D3 in the morning.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sentinel:

Great. Why not try taking some magnesium right before bedtime, too? Yes, in addition to the magnesium you&#039;re taking at noon. 

Nota bene: There are many kinds of magnesium salt, and they vary widely in the amount of elemental magnesium therein. I recommend that you read &quot;The Magnesium Miracle,&quot; by Carolyn Dean, M.D., N.D. for the full skinny. Magnesium is as important for overall health as Vitamin D, in my opinion.

PS to CC:

It helps with depression and fibromyalgia, too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, After my second day of mid-day Natural Calm magnesium citrate (2:30pm), I actually had a very good (for me) night of sleep. Fell asleep in 5 minutes, slept for six hours straight, which is unusual for me. In compliance with Dr. Roberts, I faced the rising sun for 30 minutes out of an open window from 7:30 to 8 AM. (Had to slink off to workplace.)  Hopefully mid-day magnesium plus sun, applied consistently, will yield solid results. Thanks to all for support and advice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe: You&#039;re right... maybe hypersomnia wasn&#039;t the right term.  Let&#039;s just say that she needs a *lot* of sleep.  I think she sleeps well at night, but she still needs 10-11 hours.  I think the doctors have considered depression and fibromyalgia, but I&#039;ll check.  If you guys have any other ideas, let me know.]]></description>

That&#039;s above my pay grade, but hypersomnia is the need to sleep during the day.  You didn&#039;t mention if your friend sleeps well at night. So this sounds like it might be related to depression rather than a need for more sleep. And possibly fibromyalgia, too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, thank you so much for your responses. I now see that elsewhere you defined &quot;to exhaustion&quot; as &quot;until it hurt too much to continue.&quot; That helps to clarify a bit.

Regarding your statement that &quot;artificial fluorescent lights with sunlight-similar spectrum improved my sleep&quot;, do you know  what # &quot;K&quot; temperature fluorescent bulbs do this well, and how many bulbs/watts would be necessary to have a positive impact on sleep?

BTW, I am very jealous that (as cited in your &quot;Effect of One-Legged Standing on Sleep&quot; blog entry) your daily &quot;Rested&quot; ratings only fluctuate in the narrow band between 99% and 100% (or when things are bad, between 95% and 100%). I think I am usually in the 0% to 60% category!  :)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I used 4 ordinary length fluorescent lamps. Their color temperature was about 5-6000. My face was about 4 feet away, they were shining upward I was looking forward. I wrote about this in my long self-experimentation paper (where I also discuss standing and sleep).&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;By the way, I hadn&#039;t known that Pauling was such a shit.&quot;

Speaking only for myself, I still don&#039;t know any such thing. I can only be certain that these two intelligent and opinionated men did not get along, and that Linus Pauling cannot offer a rebuttal.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;Did not get along&quot;? That understates what happened and the power asymmetry. Pauling fired Robinson for no good reason. And destroyed his data. And, apparently, threatened to destroy him. Robinson did not do anything like that to Pauling.&lt;strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dearieme, I have not tried an artificial daylight lamp; from what I know they are more for treating SAD, which I do not have.  Do you believe, from your experience, that they work for circadian-rhythm-related sleep disorders (as opposed to the Seth-recommended “real sunlight” first thing in the morning)?

Joe, regarding the magnesium dosage and timing, that’s interesting. Today I took Natural Calm (ionic magnesium citrate) for the first time during daylight hours, just to see what would happen. One thing I’ve learned from Seth’s blog is that details like timing and dosage are essential (witness Seth’s discussion re Vitamin D3 timing), but these details are often left out by someone (doctor, blogger, etc.) making a recommendation. That’s why I asked (above) if black sugarless coffee is “breakfast” for the purposes of Seth’s “no breakfast” approach; that’s also why I wonder the extent to which Seth exhausts a leg during his leg stands.  :)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I always do the one-leg stands to exhaustion. I found that artificial fluorescent lights with sunlight-similar spectrum improved my sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have done so whenever it&#039;s feasible.  Feasible = sunny + before 8 am (when I must leave for work). The advent of Daylight Savings Time has made this much more difficult (for now). BTW, I really value your original essay on self-experimentation and your subsequent discussions on insomnia on this blog, and it has led me to carefully track various n=1 sleep experiments. M negative comment above is purely out of frustration with myself, not with your theories or observations. (BTW, is &quot;black coffee&quot; - void of protein, carbs, or fat - forbidden under the &quot;no breakfast&quot; program? I&#039;ll ask again at some future time if I am getting off topic.)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: If you are waking up tired a few hours before you usually drink black coffee you should certainly try cutting it out. The caffeine may produce anticipatory waking. Drinking a lot of caffeine will certainly cause sleep problems. Cutting it out is something else to try.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Improving sleep isn’t hard.&quot; - This seems like a gross generalization.  If only it were so for everyone!  :)  Some folks with long-term insomnia like myself bounce from supplement experiment to supplement experiment (D3, l-theanine, melatonin, valerian, magnesium, etc., etc.), try one-leg standing and skipping breakfast, etc., and get no results.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Have you tried getting an hour of sunlight every morning, as early as possible?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
