		<description><![CDATA[I remember about twenty years ago or so, I read a good deal of Michael Merzenich&#039;s research on somatic maps in the cortex.  Seemed like he was doing good work at the time.  I see that Merzenich is now the co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Posit Science.  I don&#039;t know enough about the claims made by Posit Science to have a strong opinion, but Mahncke&#039;s attitude certainly gives me pause.  Too bad Posit Science can&#039;t answer simple questions about their research.  Reminds me of standard practices in the pharmaceutical industry.
