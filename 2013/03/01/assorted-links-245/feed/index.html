I only managed 4 weeks before it caught up with me.
I think overall that melatonin is too important to mess around with, regardless of whether reduced sleep schedules are feasible.

Rhineheart really doesn&#039;t know what he is doing. He hasn&#039;t taken into account nutrient interactions affecting bioavailability either.
He&#039;s bothering with adding things like ginkgo biloba whilst ignoring choline, creatine, MCTs etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Rhineheart link seems less like self-experimentation and more like marketing. He explores the positive effects in detail but glosses over the negative effects with oblique descriptors.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You might have something there. However, I don&#039;t know what he&#039;s marketing. What is he glossing over? I didn&#039;t notice that.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve Pavlina (1st page of Google results) claims he sustained it for about 5 months.  There was another quite detailed account of a woman who sustained it for a long time, maybe a year? before her life situation forced her to go back to a siesta style sleep pattern (long sleep at night, nap in the afternoon).

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: to me, 5 months = unsustainable. You&#039;d think that something that increased your free time by 100% would do better than that.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually there are quite a few people who have dramatically reduced the amount of sleep they get &amp; report positive results after a difficult adjustment period; google: &quot;polyphasic sleep&quot;.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I can&#039;t find any examples where someone maintained it for a year or more. For a few weeks, sure. The Wikipedia article on the subject mentions Buckminister Fuller but I don&#039;t trust him.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, how could you omit Rhineheart&#039;s sublime name for this substance -- &quot;soylent&quot;.  Because it *becomes* people, I suppose?

Best quote in article: &quot;After a week advertisements for fast food looked repulsive. All I crave is Soylent.&quot;

Fascinatingly, the conclusion he may be testing here is that Soylent is actually healthier than fast food?  Sudden dystopian visions...]]></description>
