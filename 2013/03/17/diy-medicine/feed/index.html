		<description><![CDATA[The drug companies and doctors are interested in the average, while the terminally ill patient decides he&#039;s either content with this average (a couple of months of low-symptom living till death) OR the option of trying something totally different and gaining years (maybe, theoretically, even curing himself).

If I understood Taleb correctly, this is an example of &quot;the long tail&quot;. Right, Seth?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The term &quot;the long tail&quot; was used by Chris Anderson, not Taleb, and refers to something else. The situation you describe might be called misaligned incentives or simply different goals. The patient has different goals than the doctors and drug companies.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article.  It really illustrates the difference in thinking between a drug company and a terminally ill patient.

Drug company (and medical profession in general) worry about what can go wrong - which could damage their reputation/financial status and don&#039;t want to go forward unless they can control/eliminate that.

Patient - sees the prospect of something that might go right, and is willing to risk poorer health or even earlier death to try it.

These are two completely different value sets, and for the drug cos to tell the terminally ill patients not to do it because it *might* hurt them highlights this difference.

The patient is willing to take a risk the drug companies are not - the drug co&#039;s, FDA etc should not have the right to stop them.]]></description>
