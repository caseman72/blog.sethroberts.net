		<description><![CDATA[My family and I love furikake, which I discovered while living in Japan in the 80s and 90s.  I find it easy to buy in the US, sometimes even at bigger grocery stores.  (You can also order it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/JFC-Nori-Komi-Furikake-Seasoning/dp/B0006G5KEY/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;at Amazon.)

The brands I buy (including the one linked through Amazon) do not have MSG.  

It&#039;s easy to make your own too: just buy some crisp Japanese seaweed (Nori), crunch it up and mix with some sugar and salt.  We often eat rice just with the nori.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used Furikake for about 10 years, but I stopped when I found that the sugar-salt combination (and especially if there was MSG) in every single flavor of them made food taste more addictive, and I wanted to eat more, not less.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You mean you wanted to eat less, not more?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, can you describe your current crazy-spicing regimen?  I&#039;m looking for ways to improve upon the effectiveness of Shangri-La dieting (in order to produce further weight loss).

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I do little with crazy spicing. What about eating more food nose-clipped?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am surprised that you accept a seasoning that has MSG.   

Russell Blaylock wrote a book called Excitotoxins that condemned MSG and aspartame, among other chemicals, for harming the brain and leading to disease.   I have heard from therapists that many of the kids they treat for ADD get better when MSG and aspartame are removed from their diets.  

Do you have a view on whether MSG is harmless?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: MSG gave a friend of mine nightmares. It isn&#039;t harmless. At least in the doses I eat it, it doesn&#039;t give me nightmares, however.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
