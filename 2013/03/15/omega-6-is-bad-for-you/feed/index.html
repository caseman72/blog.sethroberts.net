		<description><![CDATA[Is omega-3 good for us? Well all these things are contingent. Greenland Eskino with very high 3 and low 6 have such thin blood they suffer regular nosebleeds and stroke is more common than CVD. I think more to the point is that a balanced 3:6 ratio is better than a badly skewed one, and essential fatty acids are essential.
The old &quot;eat more PUFA,less SFA&quot; advice was concocted before the role of omega 3s in diet was even discovered. It was a leap in the dark. &quot;Eat a little more fish, fruit and greens and a lot less carbohydrate if your heart&#039;s a bit dicky, and for God&#039;s sake stop smoking and while you&#039;re at it don&#039;t drink so much and reduce your exposure to environmental toxins and dodgy drugs&quot; would have been better advice. 
The form of PUFA is also important:

Otherwise, I think it&#039;s back to the drawing board for this field.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m sure omega-3 is good for me. The benefits are clear and repeatable.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll try again.

The paper in question is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21367944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Changes in consumption of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in the United States during the 20th century.&lt;/a&gt;

Which I found  from a 2011 post from &lt;a href=&quot;http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.ca/2011/04/us-omega-6-and-omega-3-fat-consumption.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stephan Guyenet&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of n-3 and n-6 consumption.  It is an excellent summary of dietary changes over this time.

As for the idea that incidence had doubled, that is from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_449847.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;graph on page 19 of the charts excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from the AHA 20123 statistical update.

The number of &quot;discharges&quot; from hospitals for CV diseases went from 3.3m in 1970 to 6.2m in 2000 - an 88% increase.  Discharges means a patient that was admitted, and left, alive or dead, with a CV diagnosis.   Whereas the more commonly used &quot;mortality&quot; means dead only.  Mortality rates have improved, but that is due to better acute care.

I didn&#039;t account for population.  It was 200m in 1970, and 280m in 1980, so the CV incidence rate per capita increased by 35% over that time.

So, not as dramatic, but certainly in the wrong direction.

That paper shows that n-6 has increased and sat fats decreased over the last century, and most dramatically in the 60&#039;s-80&#039;s.  If n-6 was good, and sat fat bad, this should cause a noticeable decrease in CV events, yet they have only increased.

So I would say it is &quot;not looking good for the myth&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We can get a (US) population wide picture of Omega 6 consumption by looking at &lt;a&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, which charts trends in food, and n-3 and n-6 fat consumption over the last century.

The most amazing change is the spike in soybean oil (mostly comprised of n-6) consumption since the late 60&#039;s. there is also in increase in (soy based &quot;shortening&quot; while lard and butter decreased) Why did this increase?  

&quot;The historical event immediately preceding the largest increase in apparent consumption of soy oil in the United States was the 1961 American Heart Association (AHA) Central Committee Advisory Statement (32) that advised Americans to replace their saturated fat intake with polyunsaturated fats. &quot;

And what was the impact on heart disease from 1970 to now?

From the American Heart foundation&#039;s website, we can see from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_449847.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this graph&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of heart disease, as measured by hospital admissions, has *doubled* from in that period.

Now correlation is not causation, of course. But if something is anti- correlated - like the decrease in sat fat consumption with the increase in heart disease - chances are it is *not* the cause.

The dramatic increase in consumption of soy-fed (and anti-biotic treated) chicken probably hasn&#039;t helped, either.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Your &quot;this paper&quot; link doesn&#039;t work. I cannot find where you get the idea that the incidence of heart disease doubled from 1970 to now.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Mike W,   I don&#039;t think we can rule out this study because some of the participants were smokers.  There is no avoiding the fact that the intervention group, following the best medical advice of the day, had a 50% increase in death rate.

A good discussion on this study, and the various doctors responses, is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://hopefulgeranium.blogspot.ca/2013/02/the-results-show-that-omega-6-linoleic.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Henderson&#039;s website&lt;/a&gt;.  From there, is this quote from Professor Jean Gutierrez of Washington University;

&quot;In addition to increasing PUFA intake, participants in the intervention group reported reduced dietary saturated fat, cholesterol, and calorie intake from baseline. A negative energy balance was verified with a slight mean drop in BMI. As expected, circulating total cholesterol and triglycerides were reduced in the intervention group, but mortality outcomes were not improved consequent to these circulating lipid and anthropometric changes, which is unexpected and interesting. The more important question arising from this study may be why a dietary intervention that improved all of these commonly used surrogate end points did not reduce all-cause mortality? &quot;

So these people did what we are told to do today - eat less sat fat, lose weight and lower cholesterol, and for doing all that, they died 50% faster!

A modern version of this trial, the LOOK Ahead trial, was stopped last year after 11 years of diet and lifestyle intervention (following the advice of the ADA and the National Cholesterol Education program) failed to show any improvement in cardiovascular outcomes.  Again, the intervention group showed &quot;improvement&quot; (lowering) in cholesterol, and a small BMI decrease, but did not show improvements in CV event or death rates.  Good discussion of the trial at &lt;a&gt;Hyperlipid&lt;/a&gt;.

Not only is there a refusal by the medical community to consider that omega-6 might be unhealthy, there is equally a refusal to consider that lower cholesterol (achieved by &quot;diet&quot; or drugs) might not be healthy either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The BMJ article is interesting, but that old Sydney study has drawbacks that make it almost meaningless today.

First of all, 70% of the participants were smokers.  That may have been representative of Australian men in the 60&#039;s, but nowadays that level of smoking prevalence is unheard of in the West.  Most of these guys had 2 strikes against them already, the omega 6 consumption may have had just a minor effect that pushed them over the edge.

Second, trans fats.  Nobody was talking trans fats in those unenlightened times, so nobody measured the trans fat of the Miracle margarine that was fed to the intervention group.  The BMJ article&#039;s response section has a good post from the authors arguing why they don&#039;t think trans fat was the problem, but the bottom line is we just don&#039;t know how much trans these men were eating.  Today almost everyone (including Walter Willett) agrees that trans fats are far worse than saturated fats.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The article I cite considers several other studies. Taken together, they support the main conclusion of the Sydney study. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
