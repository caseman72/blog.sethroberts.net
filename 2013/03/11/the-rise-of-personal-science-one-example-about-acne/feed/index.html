		<description><![CDATA[The side effects of drugs on acne really does concern me.  I have to constantly take probiotics because this medication just upsets my stomach.  

Aside from the topicals we are using, has anyone used LED Light Therapy?  I know we can get treatments like this in medical offices but in this article I found, they are talking how there is an FDA approved LED Light Therapy handheld at home device.  This info is at the bottom of the article which highlights skin care devices.  Please tell me if any of you have tried it because I for one am tired of the medication.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been lucky. Most of my doctors consider me an excellent test subject, so they often put me on a medication with a specific plan to see if it is working. When I had an infection, I was told to expect improvement in so many days, and otherwise to call in and arrange for a stronger antibiotic. When I started medication for a chronic condition, we did an initial test and arranged for me to return and see if the drug was having the desired effect. There was a plan B, if it had failed.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You have low standards if you are impressed that if a drug doesn&#039;t work, your doctor will try a different one.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The contact email given on the home page does not work for me.  i hope you don&#039;t mind using comments to contact you.  &quot;email&quot; follows

Dr. Roberts-

This may interest readers of your blog.  Allan Savory has discovered a counter intuitive way to reverse the increasing desertification of arable land.  His method goes against conventional wisdom.  This method sequesters carbon, provides increased food and restores grassland all at a very low cost. Having lived in the Horn of Africa I think this is revolutionary.  I only hope he can get more traction. 

I think it is akin to the story about Father Henri de Laulanié and his discoveries about growing rice.  They were counter intuitive as well.  

Here is Mr. Savory&#039;s TED talk.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s quite evident that doctors, and scientist, forget that personal science is the foundation of all science and medical treatments. Their attitude is: &quot;If it&#039;s not Western, it&#039;s not valid. If it&#039;s not Modern, it&#039;s not valid.&quot; Humans have been tinkering around with ways and means to cure or heal themselves since the first time they stubbed their toe. Some things worked, some things didn&#039;t. The things that worked were passed down and shared with others. 

Thinking that an individual is incapable of finding a cure or making some scientific discovery is asinine.

Cheers and good health]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, doctors aren&#039;t scientists. My medical training made it obvious to me that every scientific thinking is removed from daily medical work. Don&#039;t investigate. Don&#039;t understand mechanisms. Don&#039;t use solutions that work, only because they counteract your intuition or &quot;common medical wisdom&quot; or &quot;state of the art&quot; or your private pet theory.

Use the guidelines Big Pharma wrote for us, repeat every therapy even if it has shown to work poorly (&quot;it&#039;s the best we have&quot; *barf*) and don&#039;t listen to the the patient who has a different experience - he&#039;s the layman, after all.

Doctors obey. They are the modern version of Pythagorean acousmatics.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Doctors obey, yes, but they supposedly obey scientists. Such as medical school professors.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
