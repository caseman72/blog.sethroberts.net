		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps I&#039;m mistaken, but I recall you saying in various posts that you were negative to &quot;evidence-based&quot; medicine. Maybe we have different definitions for the term. The main reason I read your blog is because you show stories like this one today and the fermentation ones, and all the others. Perhaps you meant it in a different way. I didn&#039;t save your posts so I&#039;ll have to wait until you bring it up again. Maybe you didn&#039;t say &quot;evidence-based&quot;, perhaps it was a different term you used to distinguish scientific studies from people&#039;s actual experiences and from current medical practices. 

Sorry for the confusion on my part. I&#039;m very interested in the experiences of you and others in finding ways to be healthy that work. Today in this new crowd sourcing era, we have an unprecedented opportunity to learn from millions around the world about health giving approaches that were previously unavailable to us. Some things will work and some won&#039;t of course, but the alternative is the same top-down health care we already have.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Well put. I have a low opinion of &quot;evidence-based medicine&quot; because in practice the practitioners ignore a lot of evidence. I am against ignoring evidence. I wrote about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; -- the example of tonsillectomies where the &quot;evidence-based medicine&quot; reviewers ignored a vast amount of evidence that tonsillectomies are dangerous.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, got it.

You may not give this much value, but I work with a guy that promotes juicing and a juice machine and he has a proven way to fix stomach ulcers and it&#039;s with cabbage juice. He was involved in a Stanford University study in the 50s with an M.D. that proved it. A way to make it that&#039;s more palatable is called the 3 C&#039;s and that&#039;s cabbage, carrot, celery at 1/3 each. Drink three times a day for a week or two. Not sure how this fits into your bacteria/not bacteria theory, but based on people who have had success, all it takes is freshly made cabbage juice. I could send you links if you care for it, but if you think this is too easy and food and diet isn&#039;t the answer to most trouble Americans have, then I won&#039;t bother you with it.  I like most of your stuff Seth, but I&#039;m also bothered by your lack of credence to people&#039;s own experiences that show stuff works. You downplay evidence-based approaches, which is a shame.

		<description><![CDATA[Confused. If you believe his story, and you say you do right up top, then how does it follow that you say bacteria wasn&#039;t involved?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t say &quot;bacteria wasn&#039;t involved&quot;. The 2005 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for the &quot;discovery&quot; that ulcers are caused by a certain species of bacteria. The earwax story implies that some bacteria are helpful: they hold down other (bad) bacteria. The broader implication is that when people get stomach ulcers it may be because other bacteria were not holding the bad bacteria in check. If this is true -- and I think it is likely -- then giving antibiotics for ulcers is a poor idea, even though it may help for a while.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
