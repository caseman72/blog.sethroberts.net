		<description><![CDATA[Seeing the reference to &quot;seed oils&quot; in this interesting post reminds me of a conversation I had with a biologist some 20 - 25 years ago whose &quot;animal&quot; was the locust.  This was when the scientific community was telling everyone to shun animal fat and eat only polyunsaturated oils.  She told me that grasses (including all cereal grains) defend themselves against locusts by increasing the amount of defensive insecticide they produce when attacked.  This natural insecticide is found in seed oil.  She was worried that encouraging people to ingest large amounts of oil from new sources, untested over the centuries, such as corn, safflower, etc., instead of traditional sources, such as olives, nuts, and animal fats/butter was not wise, since harvesting affects grasses the same way that locusts do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow. I knew that inflammatory bowel disease and a whole mountain of other diseases can be made symptom-free with an exclusion diet, but I didn&#039;t suspect gluten to be the bad boy in diverticulitis, too. Is there any common disease that *isn&#039;t* aided, abetted, induced, entertained or linked to grains? Besides the flu?

Is there currently any internet project collecting such first-hand stories, categorizing them and allowing for comments, questions, etc. ...?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s good. 

I found my regimen for living in China. Small meals of plain yoghurt spaced through daylight hours. Limit 2 liters per day. One package of free range organic pork, pressure cooked and otherwise plain, per day. No gorging or fasting.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You seem to be saying your health was better when you did this. What was the health improvement and what was the earlier diet (correlated with worse health)?&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
