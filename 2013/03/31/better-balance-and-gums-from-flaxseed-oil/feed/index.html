		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate you writing this. I have gum issues too. For years, i took Barleans flax oils blends because BARLEAN&quot;S is the freshest i know. They press it on the day of ordering for customers/stores. I usually buy Flax Omega Berry Swirl (with plant DHA) for a few years and it always helped me severe PMS moods, cramps, painful cystic breasts etc.. I have not taken in a few months and i have had horrible PMS &amp; cycle since, which required high doses of ibuprofen. Good to konw on the GUMS too. I will keep an eye on them to see if it helps.

In the past when I took Barlean&#039;s i did not need to take any pain pills for pms. So, after googling many articles, including yours with other reader&#039;s comments, it confirms i need to go back on what was working.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your going to think this is weird but flax seed oil prevents me from having depression. I used to feel very darkly depressed. My Dad had some flax seed oil in capsules so I tried a few. I noticed my depression lifted. Stopped taking them. Depression. So now I take a couple of tablespoons each night. I make it like the Budwig diet (supposed to cure cancer). The Budwig diet is probably nonsense but I figure it can&#039;t hurt and it taste better than pure flax seed oil. In a blender put two tablespoons or so flax seed oil, four tablespoons cottage cheese, and I pour a half a cup of milk to help it blend and go down smoother. Taste a little tangy like buttermilk. Not bad. Works for me. When ever anyone mentions depression or flax seed oil I always them what it did for me. Awful to be depressed. I doesn&#039;t made me happy but does lift the worst of my depression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, is there a particular brand you can recommend, apologies if this has been answered before.  Also I thought all plant oils were generally bad for one (even Olive oil should be eaten sparingly?) and that saturated fats were better?  I have never got my head around all the oil debate, just assume that meat cooked with animal fat seems the logical way our ancestors would have chosen.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I once compared different brands, found no difference between Spectrum, Barlean&#039;s, and Whole Foods.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been eating ground flax seed two tablespoons every moring for perhaps three months, a tablespoonor so every now and then for a few months before that. 

Unlike others writing here, I haven&#039;t noticed any effects on my teeth and gums, though both have been in fair shape anyway for the last few years, i..e. ever since I started using an electric toothbrush.
 
On the other hand I feel generally good all around, something I attribute in part to the flax seed, in part just to the overall process of looking after my diet with some care and imagination.
 
                                                -dlj
&lt;strong&gt;
Seth: You might get better results if you take more. I&#039;ve taken 2 tablespoons/day of flaxseed OIL, not flax SEED. Flaxseed oil has a higher density of omega-3 than ground flaxseed. It&#039;s also possible that the omega-3 in the ground flaxseed has gone bad, if it is not freshly ground.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Has anyone tried taking Flaxseed Pills? would that work or do you need to take the oil?

Thanks

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Flaxseed oil capsules work, but you need to take a lot of them (like 30/day) to get the best effect. I started taking capsules -- that&#039;s how I discovered the balance improvement -- but switched to flaxseed oil (liquid) when I realized how much the best dose was.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for tips, do you think our bodies&#039; can extract the oil if we buy the whole linseed, or do we need to grind it to get to the best out of it?  I just wonder if like other seeds it just passes through when digested.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m pretty sure you need to grind it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pauline, I simply mix linseed (= flax seed) into my muesli: about a generous half a (British) tablespoon into the jar in which I mix enough muesli for eight breakfasts.  That&#039;s obviously a small intake compared to spoonfuls of the oil but I assume that it does me good.  Whether it does as much good as the three tablespoons of toasted coconut I don&#039;t know.   :)]]></description>

I see they also use it as a drying agent in paint:
