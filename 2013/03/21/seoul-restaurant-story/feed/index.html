		<description><![CDATA[My recent memory of Seoul is that you could get a very good and quite large Korean meal for around $5-6. (Which was the same price as a Starbucks sandwich, or an ice cream cone, or coffee and a donut.) $60 seems sky-high for Korean food in Korea.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: It was a fancy restaurant.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here at home Shangri-la rules and we have been saving a lot of money in food. 

With something like $20 we buy food for a week, for 2 people. That includes breakfast, lunch and dinner. We buy at a local community market full with local producer. We avoid supermarkets. (Community markets are common in Mexico and they are super cheap)

Here are some examples of what we eat:

Breakfast: half a cup of chopped fruit, coffee or tea. Sometimes half an egg and a small piece of bread.

Lunch: About a couple table spoons of pasta, rice, salad, meat... you name it. We can&#039;t eat much because AS is very very strong.

Dinner: A couple cookies and some milk. Sometimes half a quesadilla (one corn tortilla folded, with cheese inside). Sometimes I would have only a cup of coffee with cream and sugar. 

Oh and all the three meals include a lot of plain water.

I don&#039;t think it can get cheaper than that. 

Since my girlfriend and me eat so little, we avoid restaurants. That may change when we enter maintenance phase, I guess.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Restaurants be damned.  What we had for dinner for two yesterday: it really didn&#039;t cost a lot.

First course: a timbale of basmati rice, a couple of ounces of smoked salmon discovered when stocktaking the freezer, red onion, and dill, accompanied by a green salad.

Second course: aubergine (i.e. &quot;egg plant&quot;) stuffed with minced lamb, red pepper (&quot;capsicum&quot;?) and onion, with spices (smoked paprika, cumin, ....).

Third course: no room.

We dined like kings, don&#039;t you think?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree. I go to restaurants for social reasons, rarely for the food.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
