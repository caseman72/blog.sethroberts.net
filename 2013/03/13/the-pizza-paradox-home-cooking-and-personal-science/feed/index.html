		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t that the point of tenure? You prove you&#039;re smart and capable of strong scientific contributions. and then you draw a paycheck for life and you&#039;re free to work on whatever you want to work on. It may be onerous to get tenure, but there has to be some selection mechanism and I&#039;m not prepared to suggest a better one.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, tenure does increase freedom. But not enough for all purposes.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sometimes the best approach when cooking is to bring out the essence of the food.  For example, I prefer most vegetables to be boiled in salted water until they&#039;re halfway between crisp and soft, then drain them and dress with butter.  

As for guacamole, my recipe enhances the essential flavor of avocado while generating a different flavor.  I will experiment with adding fermented food and will send you a link to the results.

I&#039;m actually not here to argue about recipes.  My understanding is that you&#039;re writing a book about how people can benefit by personal experimentation.  I suggest that cooking is an easy way to introduce the concept, and that guacamole may be an easier introduction than pizza.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding guacamole, I experimented with variations about 25 years ago (using different recipes).  I finally came to the conclusion that onion and peppers overwhelm the avocado, that the tomato must be peeled and chopped into tiny pieces, that cilantro must be used sparingly, and that the flavors to add are cumin, coriander, onion salt, and garlic powder.  I haven&#039;t taken the test further to determine if lemon juice or lime juice is best (or balsamic vinegar in your case . . . . I don&#039;t like vinegar).  

It&#039;s a small group of ingredients which can be combined quickly to create side-by-side comparisons, with no baking required.  

The only problem is that after creating your own recipe this way, no restaurant guacamole compares.  All the others are a variation on, &#039;how disappointed am I going to be?&#039;

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s good to know. You don&#039;t like vinegar? Apparently you like sour, since you use lemon juice or lime juice. I fail to see the difference between using vinegar and using them. None of your ingredients produces a complex flavor. I think there is room for improvement.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cooking is the easiest place to learn the rewards of self-experimentation.  And in my opinion, guacamole is easier than pizza.

Base:
either mashed or cubed avocado

Vegetables:
one or more of: tomato, peppers (green, red, jalapeno . . . ), onion, garlic

Herbs and Spices:
one or more of: cilantro, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, cilantro, salt

Citrus:
lemon juice or lime juice

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I suggest adding balsamic vinegar. And irregularly chop the red pepper.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding the best pizza to be had in New York, the 3 I like best, in descending order of excellence, are Difara in Flatbush, Totono&#039;s way out in Coney Island, and  Grimaldi&#039;s by th Brooklyn Bridge. Now this is just from the places I have tried. Supposedly authentic pizza places are popping up all over Brooklyn and NY that many say are the equal of the above named places, but I haven&#039;t eaten at most of them, and the few that I have, like 88 on Atlantic avenue downtown, was very good with great fresh ingredients, but fell short of top honors.

One of these days I have to make a pizza tour of NYC - mostly Brooklyn, really - and see if I have to revise my estimates :) But I doubt. Pizza cant get any better than the first two of those places.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: Why is the pizza at Chez Panisse so bad, compared to what it could be? They could make much better pizza at almost exactly the same cost. They sell plenty of pizza at their price.

I don&#039;t know first hand about Chez Panisse because I haven&#039;t eaten there. I live in NYC and it&#039;s not convenient. Among people that I know, a lot of them think that Chez Panisse used to be better than it is, and now even though they aren&#039;t as good as before they can charge a premium based on their reputation. I don&#039;t know if this is true in the case of Chez Panisse but it does happen a lot in the restaurant business (and not just the restaurant business!) 

I was thinking about your article today and if you think about it a whole lot of food items are like this. For instance I can make a much better cheese sandwich with ingredients from most stores than I can from almost any restaurant. Peanut butter sandwiches too. Why?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps you have quite refined tastes compared to the &quot;average&quot; individual.

I tend to view these circumstances organically in that as these businesses grow ever larger they are forced to satisfice a widening but middle dominated area of the bell curve of tastes, as that is where the numbers are... It is actually an evolving process but rather it devolves to be generic overtime as that becomes the most acceptable pizza on average.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t think I have refined tastes, at least with pizza. (Maybe with tea.) I rarely eat pizza, I am not a connoisseur. I think everyone, not just me, wants a tomato sauce with a deep complex flavor. I think everyone wants a variety of textures. And so on.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The best pizza makers in New York produce fantastic pizza that I am 100% sure is much better than your friends pizza, and it is their job, so I don&#039;t think there is really much in what you are saying. I think it has more to do with the fact that a restaurant not geared towards pizza, like Chez Panisse, won&#039;t prioritize it, and further and perhaps more importantly, MANY Americans have awful taste in pizza, so few places are incentivized to produce truly great pizza. My brother in law, from San Jose, hates New York style pizza and loves the crappy stuff you get at Mountain Mike&#039;s. 

Making fantastic pizza doesn&#039;t require too much innovation - only at the beginning, until you get it right, and nothing essential about a job will make that harder to do.

Indeed, it seems like having an undiscriminating consumer base for pizza (most Americans) as well as not specializing in it but merely having it as one item among many, is what&#039;s responsible, with number 1 being the main culprit, judging by how bad pizza is in America generally, even at fancy restaurants, with the one exception being New York which happens to have an extremely discerning consumer base for pizza.

This example isn&#039;t really a good basis for making generalizations about the nature of jobs - yes, jobs can be poorly designed so that they stifle experimentation, but then again, there is nothing essential about a job that does this.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: &quot;There is nothing essential about a job that does this.&quot; Let me try again to explain it. Foragers can either &quot;explore&quot; (look for new food sources) or &quot;exploit&quot; (revisit known food sources). They can&#039;t do both at once. Jobs are essentially exploit, not explore. You hire someone to do something that will make money. I can think of thousands of examples. I can&#039;t think of a single case where someone was hired to explore. Sure, some people on some jobs do a small amount of exploration. Google encourages this -- but they have to encourage it. Otherwise it would almost never happen.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the farmers, many used to do their own science(experiments in productivity and land improvement), and a few still do (e.g. Joel Salatin).  But almost all of them these days have been brainwashed into leaving it to the &quot;experts&quot;, be it universities, USDA, Monsanto etc.  

there is certainly scope for fresh ideas from outside, like the rice example, but there is also scope from inside.  Salatin&#039;s example shows that many cattle ranchers are doing it wrong too.   

The key thing is whether their ideas are picked up and implemented by others, otherwise, like your pizza example, the personal science only gets applied by/to that one person.

I will certainly agree it is easier to experiment with things, like pizza or personal health, that you are not dependent on for your living.  But some farmers and other owner operators still do their experiments too, we just don&#039;t always hear about them.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: A book called The Power of Duck describes how a rice farmer vastly improved the yield from a small piece of land. I agree, there are exceptions.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[to be clearer: the reason that you can&#039;t get really good pizza is that very few people will pay for it - there&#039;s no market for high end pizza.  there are some places in brooklyn, franny&#039;s for example, and some newish places like motorino, that do things you can&#039;t realistically do at home.  price point is much higher than most people are prepared for when they think &#039;pizza&#039;.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Why is the pizza at Chez Panisse so bad, compared to what it could be? They could make much better pizza at almost exactly the same cost. They sell plenty of pizza at their price.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;job and science don’t mix well.&quot;

this may be true, but where you have an owner-operator, rather than a wage employee, it is is often not true.

Farmers are probably the best example.  Many great innovations, like the stump jump plough and the combine harvester were invented by individual farmers (though it often needed a company to bring the invention to market).  Farmers sometimes experiment with other things - crop and livestock management, and sometimes the &quot;experiments&quot; happen by themselves - unusual seasons/weather/soil conditions, noticing a difference between early and late planted X, or what happened when they didn&#039;t plough/spray, or when they overgrazed, etc

i&#039;d say the key ingredient is a motivation to invent/innovate/learn.  It is not just the independently wealthy who have it, but also those who need to do more/better for their own good.  This is not often wage earners.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The revolution in rice farming I wrote about recently happened because a non-rice-farmer got involved. One person. His work revealed that the millions of rice farmers were not doing nearly enough experimentation. Maybe they can do engineering (e.g., stump jump plough). They can&#039;t do science (here, agricultural science).&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is my wife&#039;s great advance in pizza-making.  

We like to eat cheese fondue.  There is always some left - a mixture of gruyere and emmenthal, flavoured with riesling, nutmeg and whatnot.  We put it in the fridge and use it next time she does a pizza.  Yowee!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, I needed this perspective. I often feel like I&#039;m doing a lousy job at personal science, because my record-keeping is the pits, I do experiments in fits and starts, etc. If this were my job I&#039;d never get tenure. But in the past couple of years I&#039;ve made significant progress on big problems, and I&#039;ve gained important insights. I couldn&#039;t run a pizzeria for a day, but I&#039;m turning out great pizzas at home.

By the way, Celia Green is, if nothing else, delightfully quotable: http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Celia_Green

&quot;It is easier to make people appear equally stupid than to make them equally clever, so teaching methods are adopted which make it practically impossible for anyone to learn anything.&quot;]]></description>
