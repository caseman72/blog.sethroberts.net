		<description><![CDATA[Re: &quot;I mostly read books by men, so I am puzzled that all my most favorite books are by women.&quot;

A theory: It&#039;s more difficult for women to be taken seriously as authors (see the gender counts on the VIDA website) so they have to be better to rise to the top. Along the same lines, maybe you should choose a female surgeon?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Plausible theory.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Is #7 based on personal knowledge? I couldn&#039;t find anything in the first link saying Swartz praised Adler&#039;s Kael attack.

I&#039;ll for sure read _Gone_ but Pauline rulez.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, #7 is based on personal knowledge. I had dinner with Aaron.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love reading the Amazon reviews of _Gone_.  There are a bunch of 1-star reviews right around the year of its publication.  Not a lot of people wrote reviews on Amazon back then; it&#039;s pretty obvious what was going on.

Adler is a treasure.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, the Amazon reviews are interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

Yearly assurances that the conference is merely a few old blokes playing gold notwithstanding, I find that very hard to believe.]]></description>
