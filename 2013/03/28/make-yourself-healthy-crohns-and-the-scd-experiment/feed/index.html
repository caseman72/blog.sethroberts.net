		<description><![CDATA[Enteral nutrition is only the frontline treatment for young children with Crohn&#039;s in the UK. It is a bizarre situation where the medical establishment have decided that it is effective, but only use it for children as they can&#039;t justify dosing them with steroids etc due to the awful side effects, especially on their growth. Adults on the other hand are treated just as they are in the US, with a barrage of drugs and surgeries. It is beyond sense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a really interesting story. Thank you for sharing it, and the mention of  her blog. 

I&#039;ve been reading about the SCD for years now, and it seems that, as much as American doctors criticize it, or claim that scientific research to support it does not exist, there are patients out there who claim it has helped them. 

I can&#039;t escape the sense that something about the American medical educational system, the FDA, big Pharma, and the various state boards of health is broken. They have this permanent, ingrained bias against certain therapeutic approaches. 

This is highlighted by the fact that, in other countries (e.g. Japan and the UK), enteral nutrition is a front line therapy used by the official, mainstream medical system for Crohns sufferers. (See the book &quot;Beat Crohns!&quot; on Amazon for more on this).  

So, why does medical science in the UK and Japan endorse a dietary-based, primary therapy for Crohns, while medical science in the US can never quite find support for anything but surgery and drugs? 

It makes no sense.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, well-put.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do people ever read the research?


Here is what I found when I looked a recent review article:

&quot;Numerous studies claim that corticosteroids fail to induce mucosal healing in the treatment of CD, while small uncontrolled studies showed mucosal healing with enteral nutrition. Specifically, the latter studies reported downregulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both the ileum and the colon after enteral nutrition – potentially very interesting observations in respect of achieving a healthy mucosal immunity. Given that the ultimate goal in the treatment of CD is mucosal healing (in addition to symptomatic improvement), this advantage of enteral nutrition over corticosteroid is valuable in therapeutic decision-making.

(...)
Further well designed large trials are necessary to support the current knowledge on enteral nutrition including long-term benefits of these interventions. Improved evidence to support the role of dietary interventions for inducing and maintaining clinical remission could lead to reduced need for drug therapy with its associated risk for adverse effects.&quot; (YAMAMOTO et al., 2009, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04035.x/full)

What does that tell you?]]></description>
