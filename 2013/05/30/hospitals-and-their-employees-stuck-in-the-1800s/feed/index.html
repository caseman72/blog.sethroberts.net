		<description><![CDATA[Robert X. Cringely has interesting article related to this 

What Intel and AMD clean rooms could teach hospitals

&quot;Hospitals follow the same mindset and have generally believed they can deal with most problems by cleaning and sterilizing after the fact.  The circulating air and every person that enters a patient’s room is introducing contamination.  Once you understand the full implications of this, you can make hospitals MUCH cleaner and safer.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Yet another example of the uselessness of the medical establishment. 

The gastro doctor I went to in the USA refused to prescribe me UDCA. After doubling or tripling my dose of UDCA in China, my limitation of only being able to eat a 1000 calorie diet, and my symptom of having pale colored stool disappeared. 

This doctor prescribes UDCA to many patients, knows that it has practically no side effects at any dose and can be generally regarded as safe, knows that all his patients who are on it love it, yet when I explained my symptoms and theory, and requested UDCA, he refused to prescribe it. Instead he ordered tests which came back inconclusive, and I languished on, sick for months, with no resolution. 

This same doctor flushed red when I pointed out the obvious fact that he had not done anything much for [family member] over years of treatment. He became combative and critical towards me. Afterwards attending family members felt I had been rude for mentioning this fact in passing - even though it was a necessary component of the answer to a question he had asked me.

Then I went back to Asia, where UDCA is not limited by prescription, and fixed it myself.

Doctors are evil idiots, insulated from delivering results, and regulation destroys incentives for good care.]]></description>
