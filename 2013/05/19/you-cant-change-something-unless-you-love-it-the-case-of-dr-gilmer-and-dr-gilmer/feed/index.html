		<description><![CDATA[Allen K., 

I agree with you whole heartedly. We need to help those that truly care about good governance by getting rid of the monopoly of government, or rather, statism. This would enable those that truly care about others, through the free market, to help their fellow countrymen.

As we saw from Seth&#039;s anecdotal story (which holds much truth) the monopolies don&#039;t work, it is the individual who has interest in making a difference that does. Unfortunately monopolies only create bureaucratic entities that don&#039;t care about their customers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Without love, you not only can&#039;t change something, you can&#039;t even truly understand it. Loving a thing gives you the opportunity to know it. 

This is also true of creative endeavors. Sometimes people who don&#039;t like a given creative genre – say, country music – will still set out to write something in the idiom, thinking it is &quot;easy.&quot; 

They invariably do atrocious work. 

The audience for creative works – and perhaps for things like cities, phones, etc  – is itself there in the hopes of loving the thing. So only through love does the creator have even a chance of creating a thing a user would love.

Love from creators is crucial yet undervalued. And the result on the audiences&#039; side is delight, which is also usually an afterthought. 

A good case in point is New York&#039;s repurposing of the disused elevated train tracks into a park. For years it was mocked as a foolish idea. Now cities all over the world are falling over themselves to create their own parks in the sky.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, where this point is present in American op-ed thinking is in those that call for government-hater politicians to get out of the way of those who would actually attempt good governance.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You might be right: people who dislike government will be bad at it. But the original claim is about the objects of governance.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
