		<description><![CDATA[Thought you would be interested in this experiment: http://robrhinehart.com/

One criticism I would imagine you would share with me is the lack of bacteria in his diet. Otherwise an interesting idea to test nutrientism to its extreme.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, not enough bacteria in his diet. I also wonder if he is getting enough omega-3 and Vitamin K2. I give him credit for two things: improving his diet; and doing the improvement in a sustainable and intellectually engaging, non-dogmatic way. Lots of people improve their diet in non-sustainable and/or dogmatic ways.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
