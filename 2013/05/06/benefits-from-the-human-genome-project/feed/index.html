		<description><![CDATA[Would you bemoan the work of early cartographers for not being able to predict ocean currents? There&#039;s certainly a lot of hubris around mapping the genome, but I think that we first need a map before we can begin to make any sense of the territory. Picking nits with the map-makers over how they justify their work certainly isn&#039;t helping.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: They think disease has a lot to do with genome, I don&#039;t. I don&#039;t think it makes your point of view more persuasive to call a different point of view &quot;nit-picking&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is a reasonable time frame to expect successes from a project like this?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth:  I think a fair comparison is with (a) other ways the money might have been spent (e.g., how much would these other projects have accomplished in the same time?) and (b) claims made when the money was being asked for. &lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>
