		<description><![CDATA[motivation is the result of specific mental states. maybe meeting the scholarship recipients made it easier for the cold-callers to invoke the recipient&#039;s desires and &#039;borrow&#039; their motivation? the increase in motivation/effectiveness may come from something as simple as asking and answering the question &quot;what would i do if i were a scholarship recipient? empathy is a powerful tool.

in any case, interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well my inner skeptic is saying, is this just another version of the Hawthorne Effect?  I.e. their productivity improved simply because they knew someone was trying to improve their productivity.

He says he tried things that didn&#039;t work, so maybe it&#039;s not the same effect.  A key distinction would be if the productivity gains persisted long term.  At Hawthorne, it always fell back to baseline eventually.
