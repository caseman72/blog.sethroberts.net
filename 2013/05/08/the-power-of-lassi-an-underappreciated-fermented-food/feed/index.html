		<description><![CDATA[A couple of years ago in Turkey we discovered Ayran. After learning it was yogurt, we ordered it every time we ate out. Usually the wait staff were surprised and amused when we did, but I&#039;m convinced it protected me from stomach complaints due to unusual foods for the duration of our trip. It was also very tasty. I found Ayran to be saltier than the sweet Lassi we order at the Indian restaurant. More similar to the Salt Lassi, although thinner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I have recently started making my own kefir, I have been on the lookout for anything similar in the supermarkets here. I recently noticed Lassi on the shelves in the UK stores, near the milk/yoghurt section, wondered what it was:

		<description><![CDATA[To Seth: No way!  Too doggone lazy for that. Plus, I have no access to fresh goat&#039;s milk.

I get this brand: http://www.redwoodhill.com/kefir

The plain goat&#039;s milk kefir. I get it at a local health food and nutrition store. It seems to be very highly rated, too. It&#039;s so tasty that I have to watch that I don&#039;t drink too much. I drink about 6 ounces per day. It&#039;s delicious!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for the recommendation. Yeah, maybe I should be that lazy.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my experience kefir has exactly the same difficulty as yogurt -- almost no difficulty at all. 

I don&#039;t follow instructions to strain the kefir, just skim some off the top for the next batch. That&#039;s because I let it ferment until a small 1 cm band of clear whey appears on the bottom.

I do use my yogurt maker since our house lacks central heating, Temperature setting is 28C. After 12 hours it&#039;s done. Delicious, carbonated, complex.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s a good idea, use a yogurt maker to make kefir.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like kefir. Try kefir made from goat&#039;s milk. It&#039;s got all 12, too.

Yummy!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: do you make your own kefir? I have found it harder to make than yogurt.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
