		<description><![CDATA[In response to Alex about fermented foods:  the fermented processes that I find concerning are when we fortify our food with protein (such as in the baking of many wheat breads) and then add high concentrations of bacteria or yeast to speed the fermentation process and &quot;add flavor&quot;.  The natural fermentation processes that are slow and on foods naturally low in protein are not the issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled on this site, but the older posts on this subject were closed to comments so I just thought I&#039;d comment here. I&#039;m a Vitamin D and sleep enthusiast, but the theory I follow has nothing to do with the time you take Vitamin D. Instead, it&#039;s all about what your level is. (60 - 80 ng/ml being optimal). I didn&#039;t see her theory mentioned anywhere so I thought I would direct you to it.

I also highly recommend her YouTube videos. I think she&#039;s onto the real mechanism between Vitamin D and sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you have been advocating a lot of fermented foods. Does Katie&#039;s research change your mind on that at all?

Katie, do you see things like sauerkraut having an affect on your daughter? Have you stopped eating fermented foods and would you recommend that to others?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, this work doesn&#039;t change my mind. The benefits of fermented food are clearly huge. Maybe some people are more sensitive to glutamate than usual -- perhaps for enviromental reasons, perhaps for genetic reasons. Sauerkraut is not fermented protein; only fermenting protein produces glutamate.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been meaning to comment for a while:

The Fertility Awareness Method is another good example of people using personal science to solve problems one step ahead of traditional medicine. 

Here&#039;s a video that gives you some idea of how it can be applied:

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting.

I&#039;ll go out on a limb and agree with the evil experts statement: &quot;They told us they hadnâ€™t seen gluten-and-casein-free diets produce improvement.&quot;

IMHO they say that because, in fact, they have probably seen lots of people attempt gluten-and-casein-free diets which produced no improvement.

Back in the day when autism intervention diets were hard, you couldn&#039;t eat anything packaged or processed. Now there are whole factories making easy processed packaged foods which are GF and sometimes GFCF. And we don&#039;t see any improvement in the kids symptoms. So I fully understand where the medical professionals were coming from.

&quot;Our new diet mainly consisted of organic vegetables, fruits, seeds, nuts, meat, quinoa, and rice. We stayed away from any product with processed soy, corn, or wheat (because of the processed protein). Corn on the cob or edamame was fine because they arenâ€™t processed.&quot;

That&#039;s hard to do. That&#039;s more than GFCF. That&#039;s old-school GFCF. And it&#039;s probably what is needed to really see an improvement. 

We do something like that, we&#039;ve seen enormous progress in our children who have autism. However, it&#039;s hard to cook _all_ the time. Eating out is a crap shoot every time. At school the most well meaning staff will sometimes make a mistake, feed your kid something off list, and you won&#039;t know, other than your really effective diet mysteriously quits working for a day or three.

This glutamate angle is interesting. We&#039;ve been pursuing a low lectin approach for awhile but we&#039;ll have to queue this up for later.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: These results make clear why a GFCF diet could sometimes work, sometimes fail. They sometimes fail because there is so much glutamate in the rest of the diet that even when gluten and casein are eliminated there is still a disabling amount of glutamate left. The real expert failure here is not their statement about GFCF diets, which could easily be accurate, but their failure to learn from this success.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
