		<description><![CDATA[The coach is not at fault because he didn&#039;t try to deceive. The hiring manager is being pragmatic rather than following the rule of his institution. The rule is wrong, and the harm is that the school is making conditions in its advertising that it does not actually follow - a low level of lack of integrity - and thereby is depriving itself of the potential services of even better coaches who lack a degree and who took the school at its word that a degree was required. I&#039;m not affected, I don&#039;t care much, but others should care a little.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, we should care, but rephrase. &quot;Real diploma-holders can&#039;t make top diving coach.&quot; This is not the first time I&#039;ve noticed that a conventional diploma looks like a handicap. 

Instead of putting the lump of butter on the toast, put it on the knife, and then use the toast&#039;s natural roughness to rasp off layers of butter. Especially effective, in comparison, if your butter is cold. If instead it&#039;s warm, the amount can be controlled by carefully angling the knife. It scatters crumbs, but doesn&#039;t toast tend to do that anyway?]]></description>
