		<description><![CDATA[I have the older Auber control (which still works great after 4 years).

Rice cookers work better than crockpots because they heat from the bottom. 

Definitely need to add to the tips that, since you&#039;re using an offboard temperature controller, you need to make sure that the onboard temperature controls are minimal or non-existent (again, points for the rice cookers).

Bags that float can be weighted down with fishing sinkers and alligator clips (the lead will be on the outside of the bag, not the inside).

When making stuffed grape leaves, Mediterranean cooks will simmer them with a weight on a plate on top. I&#039;ve had great luck with putting a stoneware soup bowl on top of my bags, and then having the water level fill the bowl and go just above the top. The stoneware rises fairly quickly to the ambient temperature of the water, and keeps your floaters under control.

		<description><![CDATA[hihi

The problem is with meats etc. that have germ risk. these will not be sterlized with this device.

If you have read the &quot;how to get Smarter&quot; guy (this with the Russian name, hope you remember), then you will see that this method of cooking eliminates the health issues he claims to be had with high temperature cooking]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, great insights! Glad to hear the Dorkfood unit works well. It seems like there&#039;s no reason that sous vide ovens couldn&#039;t eventually be as cheap as crock pots. Here some more info on the plastic safety issue:

		<description><![CDATA[I have a Sous Vide Supreme (SVS) and I heartily recommend it. Before that, I, too, used a temperature controller connected to a multi-cooker. As far as I can tell, yogurt made in the sous vide supreme is a bit better than my old method due to the superior temp holding capabilities of the SVS vs a multi-cooker or crock pot. (Crock pot will significantly overshoot and undershoot for up to a 5-10F swing). For most things it might not matter too much, but when you are cooking at the low end, say 131F, a significant portion of time spent under the 131F food safety cutoff could result in less than a 7D reduction in bacteria.

I use mine enough that it has dedicated counter space, but I do understand the virtues of something that takes up less space.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As B.B says, i dont think you have thought about all chemicals there are in &quot;normal&quot; plasticbags, the sous vide plasticbags, are tested and made for cooking at different temperatures, but a lot of cheap plasticbags/frostbags, are NOT, cause they are not made to heat/cook in them!

Think about that aswell, for me it is a big thing there always sous vide plastic bags and a vacuumsealer

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, this is an important issue.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post. I&#039;d been thinking about the Sous Vide Supreme but couldn&#039;t justify the cost or space lost.  This looks like a home run.

Off topic, Seth, but pretty interesting:  Powdered food is way more fattening than non-powdered amounts of the same nutrients:

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The powdered food effect is a lot like one of Israel Ramirez&#039;s experiments, for example that baked bread is more fattening than the same dough uncooked.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I think that the primary purpose of getting all the air out is to keep the item completely submerged.  It cooks better when it is completely submerged.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I found that the item can be completely submerged using freezer bags. It is easier to get complete submersion with vacuum-packing, that&#039;s true.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
