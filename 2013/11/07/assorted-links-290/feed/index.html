		<description><![CDATA[“Kynes knew that highly organized research is guaranteed to produce nothing new.”

I wouldn&#039;t go that far. I have learned very useful things from highly organized research. For example,

1. A big time use survey found that Americans stayed up an hour later than people in 12 other countries. Also Americans watched TV an hour later. This suggested to me that TV could substitute for human contact in the control of when we sleep -- a crucial step toward discovering the effect of morning faces on mood.

2. A big survey found that people who have insomnia are much more likely to get depressed in the following years than people who don&#039;t have insomnia. This too helped me discover the effect of morning faces on mood.

I disagree that highly organized research can&#039;t find something new; what is more true is that the researchers who do such research are unable to take advantage of the new information. They are too wedded to certain methods, theories and so on, that worked well in the old ecosystem -- the one that doesn&#039;t contain the new information.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of tangential interest perhaps: I was recently moved to reread Frank Herbert&#039;s Dune, where I ran across the following:
&quot;Kynes knew that highly organized research is guaranteed to produce nothing new.&quot;
The copyright of the book is 1965. Interesting that a science fiction writer had an insight back then that still escapes researchers today, nearly 50 years later...
(And how scary to realize that that book is nearly 50 years old!)]]></description>
