		<description><![CDATA[I am interested about the orange glasses. Where can you get one? have anyone tried it? those it work? Computer, TV, fluro lights are bad for sleep.
I will try the honey. I also do EFT in bed ( emotional freedom technique) sometimes it helps. I have an active mind and keeps chatting when I am trying to sleep.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I got my oranges glasses from amazon.com. You might try getting plenty of sunlight, like an hour, in the morning. That might slow down your active mind at night.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing this for about a week and a half now, taking 1.5tsp of honey ~45-60 minutes before bed. I&#039;ve noticed two things so far. One, my feeling after my morning workouts improved. This is subjective; I don&#039;t have any hard strength or endurance numbers to back up any improvement yet.

The second is more objective: after about a week (didn&#039;t start happening right away), I have regularly started waking about an hour before I usually do, and when I wake, my body feels like it&#039;s ready to get up. The only reason I go back to sleep is because I check the clock and it&#039;s 3:30am.

Next thing on the list is to shift my bedtime so I early wake at a less obscene hour and watch my performance to see if the early waking is because honey is improving or disrupting my sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;You’ll get ZERO bleeding gums, and no soreness whatsoever. And no infections.&quot;

Well, like I said, it gets worse the more I brush. My personal experience is different than your expectations. I also don&#039;t eat sugar (except this honey experiment and the occasional fruit) or grains.

In fact the only thing I&#039;ve really found that gets rid of my gums bleeding is proper omega 3 to omega 6 ratio.

Anyway this is rather tangential to the subject at hand. I&#039;ve found that I sleep better with honey, but I&#039;m waking up sooner. I don&#039;t feel any less refreshed, maybe a bit more refreshed in fact. Just strange to be waking up at ~5am.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[GeoffD, I found that combining the honey with coconut oil didn&#039;t seem to work as well. I did it for similar reasons to you. It might be worth considering that you want that quick insulin spike and temporary rise in blood sugar from the honey. Adding a fat possibly changes things a bit. But test it and see what happens, I kind of like the idea of trying to combine other foods for a better effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I get less bleeding with gums and no soreness.&quot;

You&#039;ll get ZERO bleeding gums, and no soreness whatsoever. And no infections.

&quot;how do you explain the excellent oral health of pre-agricultural remains?&quot;

They didn&#039;t eat what you (probably) eat, especially all the sugar and carbs.

&quot;I’m also not sure that good dental health CAUSES good heart health. Bleeding gums and heart disease are common side effects of chronic inflammation. Brushing your teeth doesn’t fix inflammation, though.&quot;

Poor dental health creates bacteria in your blood. If that bacteria reaches your heart, there go your heart valves. E.g., endocarditis.

http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/endocarditis/DS00409

You&#039;ve basically got it backwards, my friend. Bleeding (infected) gums can cause chronic inflammation. Even stress can, in the form of cortisol.

Another good book to read is:
The Great Cholesterol Con: The Truth About What Really Causes Heart Disease and How to Avoid It, by Dr. Malcomb Kendrick
http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Cholesterol-Con-Disease/dp/1844546101]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if this brushing mouthwash thing is true. My gums seem better when I only brush once a day. I get less bleeding with gums and no soreness.

I also eat fermented foods and not much sugar. I think there&#039;s something to Seth&#039;s bacterial space competition theory.

If brushing and mouthwash, etc is so necessary, how do you explain the excellent oral health of pre-agricultural remains?

Only if you want to keep your teeth!

And it&#039;s not enough to just &quot;brush.&quot; You need to use the right kind of brush, use the right kind of mouthwash, maintain the proper PH level, eliminate harmful bacteria, etc. 

You&#039;ll notice the difference IMMEDIATELY.

And since dental health is so important for HEART health, maintaining proper dental health can literally save your life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tried a teaspoon of honey last night with no effect. But I must say I had friends over, so I had several beers, and since alcohol always makes me sleep deeper but shorter (and the sleep seems of lesser quality), this was not a good night to test it. But I felt obliged to do it and report back here after my comments yesterday. I&#039;ll report back again when there&#039;s something to report.

Oh, Seth, and if you&#039;re planning on re-reading &quot;Kiss your dentist goodbye&quot;, you may want to pick up &quot;Cure tooth decay&quot; by Ramiel Nagel as well.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I can&#039;t say 1 teaspoon is the best possible dose. The best dose might depend on body weight. If you are uncertain whether there is any effect, you should use a larger dose, such as 1 tablespoon, so that if there is no change it is unlikely that the dose was too small.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well I&#039;ve had a teaspoon of honey up to an hour before bed for the last three nights. It has not helped me get to sleep quicker, but I am finding that I wake up earlier. I can only assume this means my sleep has been deeper. I have also had some fairly odd dreams. It is quite rare for me to remember dreams. I also seem to be losing weight and have changed nothing else in my diet or daily routine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth

Were you aware that consuming sweets later in the day improves response to light therapy for seasonal affective disorder? This seems like it could be related to consuming honey at night.   You can find the paper in Psychiatry research 46: 107-117.  The authors are Kurt Kriiuchi,AnnaWirz-Justice,and Peter Graw.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No, I didn&#039;t know about this. Fascinating.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
