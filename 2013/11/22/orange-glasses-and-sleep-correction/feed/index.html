		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using Uvex blue-blockers in the evenings, and put low-blue lights in my house. The blue-blockers really help when looking a computer monitor. Wearing them definitely helps me fall asleep earlier, and I often find myself crawling into bed around 9:00 pm. Prior to wearing blue-blockers, I could easily stay up till midnight. I am convinced that wearing blue-blockers in the evening lowers my waking blood sugar the next morning, but the relationship is complex and influenced by other factors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been wearing orange glasses in the evening for the better part of a year now, putting them on at a time roughly corresponding to Astronomical Twilight* - which is about 7pm this time of year.  The first thing I notice is that I immediately almost immediately start feeling tired and yawning.  When I go to bed, around 9pm it will take me only 3-5 minutes to fall asleep.  Since I wake for work well before sunrise I also wear them in the morning until the first hints of sunlight.  Be careful driving in them though.  If you&#039;re being pursued by the police their lights are rendered invisible.

* I ignore daylight savings time rules here, meaning that if observing DST Astronomical Twilight occurs at &quot;6pm&quot; but that&#039;s an artificial creation.]]></description>
