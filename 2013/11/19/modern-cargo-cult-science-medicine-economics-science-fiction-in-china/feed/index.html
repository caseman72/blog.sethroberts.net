Nancy, I follow a few links on this. All South Korean elementary school children are exposed to a book of &lt;i&gt;stories&lt;/i&gt; taken from the Talmud, it seems. This is hardly an attempt to &quot;match Jewish intellectual achievements.&quot; It&#039;s no different than reading a book of Bible stories.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s what Feynman said about rat experiments in psychology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was at Cornell, I often talked to the people in the psychology department. One of the students told me she wanted to do an experiment that went something like this--it had been found by others that under certain circumstances, X, rats did something, A. She was curious as to whether, if she changed the circumstances to Y, they would still do A. So her proposal was to do the experiment under circumstances Y and see if they still did A.

I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the experiment of the other person--to do it under condition X to see if she could also get result A, and then change to Y and see if A changed. Then she would know the the real difference was the thing she thought she had under control.

She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her professor. And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has already been done and you would be wasting time. This was in about 1947 or so, and it seems to have been the general policy then to not try to repeat psychological experiments, but only to change the conditions and see what happened.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I take that to be criticism of the whole field of rat experiments in psychology. I have done a lot of rat research and I spent very little time (none) repeating earlier results from other labs. Likewise for the other rat researchers I know about. Of course, some people do that, but very rarely. As Feynman and the Cornell professor said, it is uncommon.

I agree with Feynman&#039;s general point and would put it like this: &lt;strong&gt;go as slowly as possible consistent with progress&lt;/strong&gt;. Everything is more uncertain than you think. But I have yet to hear another researcher agree with me or say the same thing. So I assume they don&#039;t follow this advice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Long term follower of your blog. First time commenter. 

My interpretation of Feynman&#039;s criticism rat experiments as cargo cult science is a little different. 

I remember the story he told about the rat experiments. The one he praised was a scientist who tested every possible variable and documented them all. 

What he wasn&#039;t a fan of was scientists who don&#039;t document every possible variable and just publish their positive results. Which means others can&#039;t accurately replicate the experiment because they didn&#039;t know what wasn&#039;t documented. 

This is just what I got from it.]]></description>
