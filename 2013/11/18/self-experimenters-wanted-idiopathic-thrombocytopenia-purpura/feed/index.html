		<description><![CDATA[I self-experimented successfully with ITP. I had a recurrence, after having a splenectomy that seemed to work for four years or so. When it recurred, I went to a doctor who prescribed prednisone. Instead of immediately starting on the recommended dosage I eased into it—started with much smaller amounts than prescribed, then ramped up slowly until I saw an effect. I was getting daily blood tests at the time, and used the tests to monitor platelet levels. 

When I got to a normal level, I plateaued the dosage, and then gradually ramped down. I found that the platelet levels stayed normal as I decreased the dose, and when I was off. I have not had a recurrence in about 25 years. I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t remember amounts, but the ramp up and down periods were about 3 weeks each.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The ingredients in the said are Citric Acid: 300mg and Magnesium Oxide Complex: 600mg.

Medium-density carbohydrates (fruits, starchy vegetables, 
dairy products): These foods have more carbs per serve than the low-density carbohydrates.
Remember that most unhealthy snacks have a healthy alternative.]]></description>
