		<description><![CDATA[it sounds like the problem isn&#039;t how to devise better teaching methods but how to persuade students to care enough to be taught. you can&#039;t teach a kid algebra if he doesn&#039;t see how algebra helps him get something he already wants, or if learning algebra prevents him from getting something he wants even more. algebra has to be important enough to capture his attentional resources long-enough to learn it. the entire system of values matters.

there&#039;s a lot of cynicism surrounding this topic, and i think a good chunk of it springs from the assumption &#039;&#039;better at school = intrinsically better&#039;&#039; (a shared assumption that probably makes it easier for members of some communities to invest in education!). if academic achievement has more to do with modifiable values than the presence of a super-enzyme in the brain a lot of people&#039;s self-worth will be jeopardized (unnecessarily, i might add).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They don&#039;t tell you in ed school--in fact, they kind of try to get you to believe otherwise--but some truths about high school teaching are:

Your students will not care about your subject as much as you do.

Many will not care about it at all.

Some will, however, be interested in passing.

You will try to get them interested in something more than passing.

You will largely fail.

Most of what you test on, and that students seem to have learned, will be forgotten before they start the next school year.

You can pretend this isn&#039;t true, which is dishonest but may spare your sanity.

You can just not think about it, which is the default of most teachers.

Or you can revel in the small, real triumphs.  &quot;________ wrote three complete sentences which followed each other logically.&quot;  &quot;_________  now cares enough to get a diploma.&quot;]]></description>
