		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth. Thanks for the link! Just some follow-up. I use Aunt Sue&#039;s Raw honey. I&#039;ve tried using the raw organic stuff from Trader Joe&#039;s and it tastes like crap and didn&#039;t have the same effect at all. Aunt Sue&#039;s is about twice as expensive but tastes great and works like a charm. 

We actually recorded a podcast with Tim Ferriss yesterday and as an experiment I stopped taking it the night before the show so we could talk about it and I slept like CRAP! Went back on it last night and slept like a baby and woke up feeling great. 

Our new ep with Tim comes out on Friday. We spent a good hour and cover some good stuff including this. 

Cheers!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thank you, Jason. If I want people to read just one reaction to my original post, I give them yours.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@August

I use to have nightmares from age 10 to age 27 EVERY night. Bad, horrible, make-you-feel-like-crap nightmares... Then i found out why:

It only happened when i HATE before bed (2 hours or less). So everytime i went to bed with my digestion going, i was 100% sure to have nightmares. It took me so long to notice that... but anyway, now i did and im really glad. 

Digestion is a process that use tremendous resources and energy so it somehow affected my brain. Now that i dont eat before bed, no more nightmares.

To solve your problem, i would not eat 3-4 hours prior to bed + drink a SMALL cup of water+honey (100 ml or less). Maybe your cup is too big (americans tend to have a &quot;skewed&quot; vision of what small is ;)

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;What kind/brand of honey did you use? Do you think the quality of the honey matters, i.e. raw vs. heated, organic vs. conventional? Is Manuka honey a good option?&quot;

I have used French, German and Australian honeys. They are heated, probably conventional although I am not sure. I don&#039;t know if Manuka honey is worth the extra expense. You certainly don&#039;t need it for this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More of a question then a comment. Isn&#039;t honey you buy in the store homogenized, heat treated? Maybe try fresh honey for better results. I just read this so I&#039;ll give it a try.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Pasteurized (= &quot;heat treated&quot;) honey works fine for this. I don&#039;t know what you mean by &quot;homogenized&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will def. try this although a tablespoon of honey contains approx. 17g of carbohydrates and I&#039;m a low-carber. 

As to the vivid dreams, I found out by chance that Vit. B6 is required to have them. So if you&#039;re lacking try to increase food containing it or supplement. It&#039;s fun!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The honey effect implies there is something seriously wrong with low-carbing -- at least the view that carbs are unhealthy. &lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A note for those who are not experiencing positive results - I would make sure that you use raw organic ACV that is, as creepy as it sounds, &quot;with the mother&quot; (this is the cloudy ACV). This is vital if you want to be consuming the nutrients and enzymes. Similarly, raw honey contains all the benefits while the processed counterparts strip all nutritional value and use artificial sweetners and corn syrup in its place. Raw honey is also cloudy and solid at room temp.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;may be an empty stomach is not so important?&quot;

Yes, that is a reasonable idea. However, I tried eating the honey with a piece of cheese. It didn&#039;t work. Why did it work when I had dessert after a meal -- perhaps on a not-entirely-empty stomach? I don&#039;t know. There are dozens of differences between 1. honey at bedtime and 2. dessert after a meal. I cannot say that dessert after a meal always made me sleep better. 

Perhaps with dessert after a meal there is more time for the sugar to be digested -- hours, for example -- before it is needed. Slowing down that digestion with other food is okay or even beneficial. Maybe the first hour of sleep is especially sensitive to blood glucose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seth: Two things seem to matter. 1. You must take it on an empty stomach. 2. You must not have sweets during the day. Did you violate either of these?&quot;

I&#039;ll give it another try... as soon as the paleo brownies are gone. :)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Very interesting...that I was able to sort of predict something.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
