		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Support for the idea that the threshold is low — lower than other people realize, too — comes from a study published last summer after my experiment. Researchers reanalyzed old data to see if there was a correlation between lunar phase and sleep quality. Their subjects had slept in a windowless laboratory room. Nevertheless, sleep was worse during a full moon. One researcher was baffled. 

I have completely failed to replicate their claim using 1600+ nights of Zeo data from myself &amp; 2 other people: http://www.gwern.net/Lunar%20sleep

There&#039;s nothing there. It was a years post hoc analysis on their part, and probably just data dredging.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[wouldn&#039;t a sleep mask be easier than darkening a room? (that&#039;s what i&#039;ve using for years)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I have been told a sleep mask is worse. Someday I will try one.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth&#039;s sleep improvement guide:
1. Vitamin D early in the morning
2. Blue light blockers at night
3. Honey before bed time
4. Dark bedroom

I&#039;m surprised he ever wakes up...ha

What I&#039;d like to see/know, is how much improvement each one provides independently of the others; does anyone of them overcome a deficiency of the others; i.e., will darkening your bedroom provide the same quality of sleep as doing all four?

This seems, to me, that it would be a very long experiment, involving many confounders - time of year being the largest (does our sleep improve, naturally, as daylight lessens, or the opposite, or not at all?). 

All good stuff for those who have trouble sleeping - inexpensive and easy to do. But, I think the darkened bedroom is probably the winner over all the others. Of course, our early ancestors, before they moved into caves, slept under very bright night skies, especially when the moon was full.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This makes sense.  I am so sensitive to any amount of light when I sleep that I have to put sticky notes over lights on the TV, DVR, clocks, etc when I am in hotels.  I find them incredibly bright and annoying. I have a neice and nephew who keep a TV on while they sleep and I worry about how this negatively affects their health.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. This one is much more obvious to me than the blue blockers. When I blacked out my windows, and reduced the overall amount of light I was exposed to, I saw a great improvement in sleep.

The blue blockers however, didn&#039;t seem to do anything.  Some of the Amazon reviews suggest some blue blockers are better than others, so maybe I need a different pair. Without the blue blockers I would get sleepy and go to sleep. With the blue blockers on, it seemed I was not getting sleepy.  My sleep quality seemed the same, but I think I might stay up longer if I wear the blue blockers and don&#039;t pay attention to the time.]]></description>
