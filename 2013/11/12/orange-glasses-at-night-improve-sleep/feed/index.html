		<description><![CDATA[&quot;is there also a reason to wear orange glasses if you take melatonin tablets?&quot;

Yes. Because orange glasses probably come closer than melatonin tablets to reproducing the long-ago environment that shaped our sleep/wake system. Long ago humans got very little blue light at night -- like what happens when you wear orange glasses. Long-ago humans did not ingest lots of melatonin.  With orange glasses, it is much more obvious what the best dose is likely to be (no blue light at all). With melatonin, it isn&#039;t easy to figure out the best dose.

But there is no need to lean on theory, you can just try them. It might be easier to take melatonin tablets, I don&#039;t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Short wavelengths and melatonin production suppression is old news, but is there also a reason to wear orange glasses if you take melatonin tablets? From looking at models of human circadian rhytm on pubmed, there&#039;s still a lot of question marks, so science doesn&#039;t seem to have found the answer, but maybe a commenter can fill us in here?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;ve been using the similar (Uvex S1933X) glasses for about three months. Everything you&#039;ve written is in line with my experience. I put them on when the sun sets and have them on for the rest of the night (unless I go out that is). Along with honey before bed and magnesium tablets, this has me sleeping like a dog (this is good).

I&#039;ve also switched to wearing Gunnar Optiks brand computer glasses at work, to hopefully cut down on excess blue light from the fluorescent lights and the monitors. I recommend these as well for people who have to work on computers all day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My quick look at those low-blue light bulbs make me think they must be ordinary orange color bulbs, similar to what you put outside in order to have light without mosquitoes.

Come to think of it, maybe that&#039;s why those mosquito lights work: insects are attracted to blue lights because it stimulates the same thing it stimulates in our brains.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I first started using f.lux several years ago, the program was only able to reduce the color temperature to 2700k, which is equivalent to an incandescent light bulb. At this setting I think it still emitted too much blue light to be effective. However, the recent f.lux update now allows for a color temperature as low as 1200k, which emits less blue light than a match flame. I find this setting to be as effective as wearing orange glasses. 

Stephan Guyenet had a similar experience with the new f.lux update that he shared in a recent post: http://www.dansplan.com/blog/2476-f-lux-a-free-computer-program-that-may-improve-your-sleep

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s good to know. I used it several years, haven&#039;t tried the new version.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I use Shades (free download) instead of f.lux. It allows you to make the screen really, really red or amber, etc. (you can choose your tine color from a color palette; the screen ends up darker overall than with f.lux, and &#039;blue&#039; more or less disappears from your field of vision). 

Note that if you run f.lux and Shades simultaneously in order to get some uber-effect, the screen starts flickering spasmodically.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had read about this and got some cheap orange/yellow motorcycle glasses that were bifocals, perfect for evening screens with my older eyes.  These worked well, I got sleepy an hour after I put them on, and in a way that I didn&#039;t want to fight with to stay awake.  

I then decided to spring for a more expensive pair from lowbluelight.com, and they worked even better, perhaps placebo I thought since they cost 5 times as much.  I compared the two in looking at a pure blue nightlight I had taken out of the bathroom, and the cheap ones blocked 90% of the light, made it look brown.  When I put on the expensive ones, I had to check to see if the light was on, there was no light at all-- I was shocked by the difference.  

I have no connection to the low blue light people, though they were very helpful on the phone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a free software project out there called f.lux* that changes the color temperature of your computer screen over the course of the day. It adjusts based on your geographical location and time of day, so it can make the display redder as soon as the sun goes down outside. I&#039;ve got my laptop set up to switch between 6400K during the daytime and 2300K (dim incandescent range) once the sun goes down.

I don&#039;t have much data on the effects yet. Although I have noticed that since I&#039;ve started using f.lux I haven&#039;t been on any code-until-3-AM benders.

		<description><![CDATA[Dearieme, regular LED bulbs are also more blue than incandescent bulbs. But you can buy LED bulbs that allow you to adjust the color. At home we are trying Philips Hue LED bulbs, which can be timed to shift colors on a schedule controlled from an iPad. We skew blue in the morning, bright white most of the day, orange at dusk, then red in the evening. The Hue system is spendy, $200 for three bulbs and a controller. There are also fairly inexpensive (about $20) LED bulbs that can be manually changed to different colors throughout the day via a little remote control. We started off with one over or kitchen table, and we liked it enough to try out the Hue bulbs.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s great news. For everyone. I have been very worried that the new LED bulbs will be too blue. I didn&#039;t know about adjustable ones.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, 

I&#039;ve been using prescription orange glasses recently. I had bought cheap ones to wear over my prescription lenses. They helped my sleep, but the dual set of lens was annoying so I was very inconsistent with them. 

I have low blue light light bulbs in my house and have been putting them on at around 5pm and falling asleep around 11pm and sleeping better than ever before. I&#039;ve only been doing this for 2 weeks, but I am very confident that they are improving my sleep.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I didn&#039;t know about low blue light bulbs...how interesting!&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

It takes 15-20 minutes of web browsing in bed and I irresistably fall asleep. Been doing this for over a year.
