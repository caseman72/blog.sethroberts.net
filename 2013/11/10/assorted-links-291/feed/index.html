		<description><![CDATA[Seth, have you seen this article?

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/the-co-villains-behind-obesitys-rise.html?src=me&amp;ref=general

Have you considered the possibility that the Shangri-La diet works by modifying gut flora?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: No. the appetite reduction is very fast, too fast to involve modification of gut flora.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Long ago I worked at a university with a famously good medical school.  I asked what sorts of dexterity tests were applied to the candidates for admission.  &quot;None.&quot;

I suppose that the ancient test of tossing &#039;em a cricket ball and seeing if they could catch it was viewed as infra dig.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: This reminds me of when I asked a Berkeley professor of epidemiology about his upcoming introduction to epidemiology class. &quot;Do you cover what causes immune function to get better or worse?&quot; No, he said.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
