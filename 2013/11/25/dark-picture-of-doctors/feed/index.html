		<description><![CDATA[Seth what did you mean by a good reason? I do not think there is any way it could profit you if that is what you meant. I have been reading through your archives after finding your website a week ago (I have read about half of your posts in that time), and want to find the optimal daily dose of flax seeds for me, and since I do not know how to write code I am having trouble doing it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Yes, that&#039;s what I mean. I have learned that simply giving strangers code is a waste of time.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How can you have a &quot;risk calculator&quot; when the cause of the disease is officially unknown?

It&#039;d be interesting to see an attempt to walk back this &quot;risk calculator&quot;&#039;s basis back through all the dubious correlations to the supposed &quot;data&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[MD here.

I agree with you, roughly. We are, as doctors, neither trained in statistical reasoning nor any kind of critical thinking outside of the diagnose-then-medicate paradigm. With the advent of &quot;guidelines&quot;, things got worse instead of better, because the pharmaceutical industry now has only one attack point instead of convincing every single doctor individually, and physicians feel bound by the guidelines because deviating could be interpreted as malpractice. Every morning I go to the hospital, I know that the medical decision making part of my job could be done much &quot;better&quot; (more adherent to guidelines) by a piece of software. This nonsense system is ultimately frustrating. It also defies everyday experience. Whenever someone is about to die, we stop any medication except for fluids and oxygens, and suddenly: blood pressure becomes normal, pulse normal, blood sugar rock stable. What did we do before that, exactly? I wonder.

I remember seeing a study where some case was presented and the guidelines said &quot;prescribe this&quot;. Something like 95% said they would prescribe it, less than 70% were convinced that it is useful and less than 40% would take it themselves if they had the condition described. That&#039;s what I tell my patients: Always ask what your doctor would do if he was in your place, never &quot;what shall I do&quot;. You&#039;re more likely to get a useful answer. (This idea is a heuristic from Taleb&#039;s Anti-fragile).

And yes, except for some rather rare cases, to me, statins are the ultimate modern-day quackery. What quackery is is pitily decided by majority vote, not by independent science, not by statistics, not by experience, not by observation or even inference. People are so shit-scared by &quot;high cholesterol&quot; that not taking a statin, even only for a couple of weeks, is the same as not taking an antibiotic in a severe infection. &quot;You&#039;re gonna die!!!!!111!!!11!eleven!11&quot; Erm, what?

I furthermore roughly agree with the other commentators above my comment. They all raise good points.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Thanks for your comment. It has seemed to me that doctors are trained in &quot;critical thinking&quot; just enough to criticize alternative medicine but not enough to criticize mainstream medicine.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

I&#039;m starting to take flax seeds and want to test my brain to figure out the optimal dose but have no knowledge of writing code.

		<description><![CDATA[One thing that&#039;s not made clear on any article I&#039;ve read on this subject is that the whole idea of a &quot;risk calculator&quot; may be bogus anyway.

What you&#039;d really like is a list of causes, or of contributors to causes, of heart attacks.  What you actually have is a list of positive correlates of heart attacks.  That&#039;s a plain different animal.

For example: is their risk calculator consistent with the unexplained rise in heart attack rates during the five decades before 1960 or so, and the unexplained decline thereafter?  Not a chance, I&#039;ll bet!  In which case, it is not based on causes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John Banja, assistant director of health science ethics at the Center for Ethics and associate professor of rehabilitation medicine:

Do perfectionist doctors have trouble managing medical errors? 

 That’s part of the idea. A bigger part, however, is that most health professionals (in fact, most professionals of any ilk) work on cultivating a self that exudes authority, control, knowledge, competence and respectability. It’s the narcissist in us all—we dread appearing stupid or incompetent. The problem, I think, is that health care is so unpredictable and stressful and contains such high stakes, that many practitioners exaggerate their competence. They come to believe that one ought never appear ignorant, uncertain, hesitant or wrong. So when this professional self-image is challenged, these persons are tempted to withdraw, or become hyper-defensive or just plain arrogant.

		<description><![CDATA[I have long suspected that doctors have a strong tendency to have to be right for a combination of two reasons:

1) history - doctors used to be quite dogmatic and arrogant about their practice of medicine, so those attitudes became baked into the system; and

2) High stakes - since peoples&#039; health and lives are at stake, it&#039;s hard to be wrong.  

Very human and understandable, but not adequate as a way to function these days.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would be nice if we had a free market in the medicine market. These results are to be expected. In a free market a possible cure to these mistakes would be:

If you go in for surgery you get insurance and get paid an agreed upon amount of money if something bad happens. If a doctor has really poor results the insurance company won&#039;t supply or will make the cost of insurance quite high do to the poor results. We will then have price signals that will help us determine which doctors are best and what practices are best.

Right now, under government health care (yes, in the USA we have had government health care for a very long time - when the industry is regulated to the point that people cannot choose anymore then it is government healthcare) there are no true or very little price signals. Which is unfortunate. Many people are suffering needlessly and even dying because of it.]]></description>
