		<description><![CDATA[Is Michael Mann the only one whose model says this? One common problem with critical examples like this is that people latch onto them and insist that to discredit the key example somehow refutes all future work based on the same ideas, even as the results are applied to good effect. I&#039;m not familiar with this situation, but the constant discussion about the hockey stick seems counterproductive when newer, presumably stronger work exists.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I&#039;m not sure what you mean by &quot;this&quot; (&quot;whose model says this&quot;). If you mean &quot;there has been a very sharp warming during the 20th century, much faster than previous warming&quot; the answer is yes, only Mann&#039;s model showed this. To call this &quot;one example&quot; is not quite fair. Mann&#039;s work was given enormous publicity. At the time of the enormous publicity, many climate scientists must have had considerable doubts about it but said -- at least to the public -- nothing.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder about the estrogens in flaxseed and what their impact on your cognitive measurements might be vs. the omega-3s.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I agree, I should try another source of omega-3, such as fish oil.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
