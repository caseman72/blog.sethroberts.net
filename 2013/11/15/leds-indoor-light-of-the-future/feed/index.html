		<description><![CDATA[Brad, thanks for pointing out that I can use f.lux to control Hue lights. I didn&#039;t notice that in the May release notes, since I wasn&#039;t using Hue at the time. I use f.lux on all my computers, and I love it.

Reanna, it wouldn&#039;t be enough to have a typical cylindrical lampshade in orange. Light with blue spectrum would still be emitted at the top and bottom. The goal is to avoid night-time exposure to blue spectrum, which is absent from orange light, rather than to increase your exposure to orange spectrum.

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I&#039;m missing something here, but what about an orange lamp shade?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: it&#039;s not easy to put orange lamp shades on all of the lights in one&#039;s house...and you only need the orange light at night.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s also a computer program called fl.ux, available for most operating systems and even mobile devices, that automatically adjusts the color temperature of your displays with the sunrise/sunset cycle at your location - adding significant red to displays in the evening to reduce this kind of circadian disruption.  The latest version works even with those Phillips bulbs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s cool that Philips is building these bulbs and paying for studies... though those are pretty fancy/expensive. This podcast with Richard Hansler (PHD, 42 years at GE Lighting) is good - http://notjustpaleo.com/podcast-30-dr-richard-hansler-lights-influence-cancer-sleep-obesity-depression/

I&#039;ve ordered Bulbrite orange bulbs  - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000COZ92S/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1for our two-year old&#039;s room for storytime. 2 bucks each. The reviews say the 100 watt are enough to read by. Hopefully that&#039;ll reduce his sleep latency.]]></description>
