The words I and you seem to turn on an emotional resistance in people and they don&#039;t think about what is said. I think story telling uses the 3rd person perspective.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;[H]ow can I try the candle idea? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

I think the point of the candle is to help with the signal to noise ratio in elementary classrooms. And by noise, I&#039;m not talking about cacophony, ;) rather instructional noise.

When the teacher lights the candle she is emphasizing that the next 10-20 minutes are going to be nothing but signal. The sub-text is &quot;pay attention, because this is new and it&#039;s going to be on the final.&quot; Obviously if she lit a candelabra every morning and let it burn through the day it would not have the same effect.

As for trying it out, I think you could light a candle at some point in your lecture. Perhaps 1/2 the time at the beginning, and half the time at 1/2 way point. Then measure if students show more interest, either through follow-up discussion questions or project work or answering test questions correctly on candle topics vs. non-candle topics. If specific points within a lecture is too arbitrary, you could also try it on completely different days.

I think, though, for it to work, you can&#039;t let on that you&#039;re doing it arbitrarily as a way to &quot;trick&quot; the students into paying extra attention. The point of the candle is you are out-of-band communicating to them the impending presence of an atypical SNR.

Well, that&#039;s my hypothesis anyway. I could be wrong. :)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The notion of signalling stuff so that the body or brain can get ready to receive it is a good one. It is the whole idea behind classical (Pavlovian) conditioning. I completely agree this is a good way to teach young children. Yet it is still unclear to me how this would work in a college class.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a yarn about a young academic saying to an experienced hand &quot;the students want me to illustrate my lectures with practical examples.  What would you do in my shoes?&quot;

Answer: &quot;I&#039;d show them some.&quot;

The original point of the joke was that young academics often lack any store of practical examples.  But I&#039;ll add to it that I used often to tell stories as my way of presenting practical examples.  Of course a dim, earnest student may demand to know whether this story will help him pass his exam: only near retirement is it wise to punch him on the snoot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My kids attend a Waldorf school. The pedagogy is incredibly story-centric. (I&#039;ve been calling it narrative-based.) Even basic math is introduced as a narrative where each operator given a name for a character corresponding to what the operator does: gather/add, give-away/subtract, share/divide. I forget what multiply does.

I do remember place value is introduced as a narrative of a boy picking up stones on a river bank. The stones are picked up one-by-one, but he can only hold nine stones in his hands. No matter how careful the boy is, whenever he picks up a tenth stone he drops one. So he puts the nine, plus one more, into a pouch. But he only has room for nine pouches on his belt. So when his belt gets full, he takes all the pouches from his belt, plus one more, and puts them into a basket. In turn the baskets get very heavy. So heavy that he can only hold nine of them at a time. So nine baskets, plus one more, all go into a cart.

Teachers also light a candle before telling the stories. That really focuses the children&#039;s attention. You can hear a pin drop in a classroom of 25 first graders. I&#039;ve heard from my wife that on days she is picking up my daughter from 1/2 day kindergarten, my 3 y.o. son insists on stopping and listening to the first grade&#039;s story if when they walk by the door is left open and the candle is lit. He just stops and quietly listens in from the hallway. Seth, you might want to give the candle thing a try. ;)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s great! I agree, how can I try the candle idea? Somehow the whole story thing is missing from &lt;em&gt;Teach Like a Champion&lt;/em&gt;, a distillation of the best teaching techniques from schools across America. Even though Waldorf schools do it, which I didn&#039;t know. I will say, however, that I believe in telling true stories. Maybe that is much harder with young children.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seth, could you give an example of how you taught technical material (as in your introductory psychology classes) by telling stories? I get the principle but not the practice.&quot;

I teach technical material, I suppose you would say, when I teach statistics. I tell stories about data analyses I have done. The situation, the question, the data, the analysis, the conclusion. In introductory psychology, I might tell the story of how the researcher came to do a certain piece of research, then describe the research. Or a story that illustrates the broad point made by the research.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, that&#039;s a helpful insight. In order to make good choices about my mini-me kid&#039;s homeschool education, I&#039;ve been examining what I know and how I learned it, versus the stuff I forgot right after finals. I studied computer science, but almost everything I learned for my major came from the textbooks and projects. The class lectures added so little. I also got a minor in philosophy, for the hell of it. I remember far more of the lectures in philosophy classes, though the subject was intrinsically less interesting to me than computer science. I&#039;ve been trying to figure out why, and I think you just nailed it. Philosophy class lectures were often built on stories. Computer science lectures tended to be bullet-point presentations of textbook content.

I&#039;d figured out on my own that I should emphasize hands-on projects over repetitive drills. But you&#039;ve added two valuable insights to my teaching: walk instead of sitting, and tell stories. Thanks!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: hands-on projects need to be built on something else, I think. I tell my students stories before I assign hands-on projects.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I once started a seminar with &quot;I want to tell you a story&quot;.  Many of the research students in the audience stirred uncomfortably.  Golly, research students en masse are a woefully conservative, unimaginative lot.

To generalise: among the brightest undergraduates, those who do not go on to research tend to be a more impressive mob.  Is that your experience?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: I don&#039;t know. At Berkeley almost none of my students went on to do research. At Tsinghua, almost all the students do. It&#039;s also true that my Tsinghua students are more impressive than my Berkeley students but there are a hundred other differences between them.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the last years of her life, my mother told stories, but I always considered it a mark of her mental decline. For example, I wanted her to get to the point and tell me, &quot;John called and invited us to eat out with them.&quot;

Instead she told a story: &quot;The phone rang, and when I answered it, John said Hello, and I said, Well we haven&#039;t heard from you in a long time, and he said he was sorry, but they had been very busy. Anyway, he said that when they got home today, the dog ... [shortened here for your patience] ... and so they were going to eat out. Wow I said, that was awful. Well, he said, would you folks like to come with us? It&#039;s our treat.&quot;

Maybe I could say this was a bad story, bad storytelling. But I always thought this was the way her mind worked then, that she could not logically sum up a point, but had to reconstruct every moment, starting at an early time, and proceeding blow by blow chronologically until finally reaching the point - the reason why she was telling us this.]]></description>
