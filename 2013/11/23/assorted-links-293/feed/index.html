		<description><![CDATA[I also suspect the cholesterol hypothesis was popular because it gave an opportunity to tell people to not eat food they liked. Telling people they must give up something they like is a basic power grab.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;d add a 4th point as to why the cholesterol hypothesis was (and still is!) so popular.  Simply, they could measure it.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The neurotransmitter theory of depression has been very popular even though neurotransmitters cannot be measured.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone considering getting a PHD, I&#039;m not sure exactly what I should take away from #4.

1. Just don&#039;t do it.
2. Be more personally hesitant to do it if you have other options.
3. Be more hesitant if you&#039;re not going to a highly ranked institution.
4. Be more hesitant if you&#039;re subject matter is not as employable afterward.

Thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;[heart disease] depends on a combination of lifestyle and genetics with the possibility that infection and other environmental stressors also play a part.&quot;

The cholesterol hypothesis of heart disease was very popular, much more popular than it deserved to be based on evidence, I believe, because it allowed health scientists and their supporters to do three things they always want to do: 1. Expensive high-tech research (= high status research). 2. Promote expensive solutions (cholesterol lowering drugs). 3. Promote a pill solution (the whole system is geared for pills). The same thing has happened with depression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who has done extensive reading on causes of heart disease over the past two years - motivated by the heart attack of a loved one who had none of the usual risk criteria - I am appalled at how much time and money has been wasted by scientists pursuing the wrong things. However I am becoming more convinced that there are at least several causes for it and it depends on a combination of lifestyle and genetics with the possibility that infection and other enironmental stressors also play a part.]]></description>
