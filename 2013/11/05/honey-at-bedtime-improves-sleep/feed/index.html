		<description><![CDATA[A human&#039;s first food is breastmilk which is incredibly sweet. All infants need sugars to fuel their impressive growth within the first year until they get transitioned to solids. Lactose is in great abundance in breastmilk because it is so easy for the infant gut to break down into two basic sugar molecules which are used for forming other items and energy. The brain is wired to encourage breast feeding. The actions of latching, sucking, swallowing trigger all kinds of brain responses and the reward is more milk in the mother as demands increase. We are hardwired for the taste of sweet. If you remove lactose from an infants formula, the infant will not thrive. No other sugar comes close to lactose in the first year. There really is no substitute. And breastmilk usually puts a baby to sleep. Feeding is a lot of work and the growth of an infant is mind blowing. Fast forward to sugar when a baby is older. A connection between good feelings and having energy has been present since birth and is now in association with the taste of sweet. It is just a suggestion, but if you wish to look deeper into why we might be wired for sweet, I&#039;d start there. (PS: I&#039;m the mother of two!) And RS is fascinating to me. My 5yo daughter with Down syndrome instinctively eats cold starch. She has never been constipated which is typical of kids with DS. We raised her for 4 years on beef bone broth with lots of lactose and veggies. She is in great shape! Will check back for more info on RS. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It is because of tryptophan!&quot;

where does Doctor Strunz say this? I&#039;ll be surprised if he has any supporting evidence.

Tryptophan does make people sleepy, but the honey improves sleep throughout the night, in a big way. I have never heard of tryptophan doing that -- for example, improving how rested you feel in the morning. Nor do tryptophan-rich foods improve how rested you feel in the morning, as far as I know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Seth,

the famous German Doctor Strunz (best selling author and doctor for preventive medicine) gives the following explanation:

It is because of tryptophan!

This amino acids competes with 6 or 7 other amino acids for the brain receptors.
If you take sugar, the insulin sends the other amino acids to your muscles so that tryptophan gets to your brain. And will likely have still enough amino acids in your blood pool when going to sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have the suspicion that this ritual before bed time might have a beneficial effect on gut flora for some people. Honey in a way is a prebiotic food that could feed beneficial bacteria. 

This could explain the weight and muscle gain because of improved nutrient absorption due to a we functioning gut. The well being in the morning could be due to improved neuro transmitter renewal again through better nutrient absorption.

I will see if I can find some data and research on my hypotheses. Great article!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating discussion.  I just started trialling it last night, and although I did get up mid-sleep (usual pattern) I noticed the zeo this morning was showing solid blocks of light and rem sleep minus the short waking spikes I normally have, with a higher than normal proportion of REM to deep sleep (1.5:1 vs normal 1:1).  I should also note that I&#039;m recovering from stress-related problems including insomnia, but am not medicated.

I probably should have waited, since yesterday was also the first day of doing a new exercise program (aquarobics) but I was interested in the strength side as well so thought it might be a good combo to try.  Having been hobbling around like a really old woman most of yesterday with muscle ache from the session, I was surprised to wake this morning and find virtually no muscle ache left - maybe the drink helped with processing lactic acid?  There was also a significant drop on the scales this morning.  Admittedly, I would have expected that with the levels of exercise yesterday but while under the high stress situation I&#039;ve had over 3 months of sustained and spiked calorie deficits which failed to show any results on the scales.  Maybe there&#039;s a reason people head for sweet foods under stress?  

Re: the children growing overnight, there&#039;s some interesting research I came across over a year back now, so I can&#039;t remember where, that talks about how children&#039;s tastebuds are geared towards sweet over savoury, to the point of aversion to some savoury tastes - on a personal level I know I hated some things that I later became almost addicted to, eg avocado &amp; coffee.  This dovetails in nicely with the sleep/ growth hypothesis, I would think.

Stuart, having experimented on going raw vegan, the &#039;raw&#039; but heated honey may be because there&#039;s a definition of &#039;raw&#039; that includes anything not heated above 105 degrees F, approximately (the exact figure varies, but the highest I&#039;ve seen was 108). The idea being that the raw diet retains health properties because it doesn&#039;t kill off the enzymes in food through heating, so anything not heated above the point where they start to die off gets considered &#039;raw&#039;.  (We won&#039;t go into whether sustained low temperature heating via dehydrator a la &#039;gourmet raw&#039; recipes also kills them, that&#039;s a whole other can of worms).

Thanks Seth.  You always give me food for thought ;-)

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: That&#039;s a good point about children and growth. Yes, maybe that explains their sweet tooth. To make sure their brains have enough sugar when they are asleep.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Interestingly, there are studies that show a tablespoon of raw honey can aid in better sleep. This is due to honey being half glucose and half fructose; glucose enters the blood quickly, supplying the brain in the first half of the night, with fructose turning into glucose (provided you haven&#8217;t gorged on sugar throughout your day) slowly, meaning your body has a steady supply of energy the entire night.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious whether a mix of glucose/fructose would have the same effect as honey. If so, this would confirm that the micro components of honey are not important.

Sucrose causes more inflammation than honey, so wouldn&#039;t expect it to be as effective.

Also, contaminants in the sucrose/fructose mix could cause it to be less effective, whereas organic honey presumably has much lower levels.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s my guess on our inborn love of sweetness -- it&#039;s about milk. Human breast milk contains a significant amount of sugar in the form of lactose. Traditionally, children were nursed until at least age three (still the case in current hunter-gatherer tribes.)

An inborn taste for sweet is a big survival advantage for kids &#8212; they&#8217;ll nurse more and get lots of calories from all the sugar and fat in milk. Maybe adult enjoyment of the sweet taste is just a leftover from childhood?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Really interesting, I will try it. 
Also, I would like to add something a friend recomended me about honey. I don&#039;t know how extended it is, but he recomended, to prevent muscle stiffness  (I am not sure it&#039;s the proper name, in spanish is &quot;agujetas&quot;) , to eat one teaspoon of honey before exercising. As I workout very randomly, I usually had muscle stiffness the first days I worked out, but with the honey I never had it again. 
I guess having the proper amount of sugars available to the muscle during the whole workout keeps it from anaerobic activity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I started taking honey before bed two days ago, after reading this article. Both days I noticed that I had increased dream activity, or at least more awareness of my dreams. They also seemed much more vivid, but this may just be the difference between not really remembering/being aware of my dreams and now at least remembering that I did have dreams.

Anyway, the first day I tried this I didn&#039;t think it helped, and in fact I felt I may have even woken up more and slept less. The second day (last night) I also felt like I had woken up more during the course of the night, and again felt like I had more frequent and more vivid dreams. However, after being up for a short period of time I started to realize how good I felt overall. Perhaps my body simply needs to adjust from my many years of restless sleep to the more restful sleep that I may now be experiencing. The results are interesting enough that I will continue the experiment and see how it goes.

This idea and conversation reminds me of something someone told me years ago. They mentioned they drank something they referred to as &quot;silver tea&quot; before bed, which helped them sleep. Silver tea was simply warm milk with a small amount of sugar dissolved in it. I tried it once or twice when younger, and it did actually seem to help me sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[“I’ve heard this many times: “It’s supposed to be this way.” I am less sure. How do the people who say this know what paleolithic sleep was like? Maybe rural people always get up at night because they don’t get enough sunlight in the morning, or enough exercise or enough X — there are dozens of possible X’s.”

Not sure what you mean by that. The results from rural areas were only relevant because they fit with what scientists observed in unrelated tribal cultures. The logical conclusion is that it’s the standard and that artificial light and lifestyles change sleeping behavior. Of course our artificial unbroken sleep might be better but if your argument is that in rural areas people just don’t get enough sleep (for some mysterious reason), why would that not also apply to early humans?

Waking up at night has many benefits, survival and reproduction being the most obvious.

Also worth noting is that there is no point in having 100% identical behavior and preference among members of a tribe. Someone has to not like berries, in case they are poisoned, someone has to not sleep at a certain time, in case there is an attack etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a very interesting documentary (&quot;Lights Out&quot;) on the effect of electric light at night on the natural production of melatonin. 

http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/ID/2313199682/

After watching it, I bought a pair of the type of glasses recommended (cheaper safety glasses off of amazon) and used them religiously for 1 month. I noticed significant improvement after 3 nights which continued for the full month of use. For the next month I stopped using them and found reduced quality of sleep after 2 weeks. Before watching the documentary I had had very poor broken sleeps from doing the nighttime parenting of our 2yr old and 1 yr old.

Now that winter is approaching I am using them again at night and again noticing the sleep improvements.

I think that this is well worth watching and trying it out for yourself.

I will be trying the honey now as well, and watching for changes in sleep quality, dreaming and strength changes.

Thanks all for the insights

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Funny coincidence. A few days ago I wrote a post about the use of the glasses you are using. I agree with what you say. The post will appear very soon.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>
