		<description><![CDATA[Sorry...I wasnt talking about the strength of flavors.  I was talking about the amount of sugar (not the amount of calories).  That was exactly my point. I think there is another way to interpret these result...in terms of carbs as opposed to strength of flavor

The paleo story...carbs stimulate insulin which stimulates fat storage....cutting carbs (and keeping calories constant) would stimulate fat loss because of the hormone changes. 

I hope I don&#039;t come off too grumpy.  I do mean all of this in good faith.  Big fan of the self experiments you do and I own a copy of the Shangri-la diet (even loaned it out with my recommendation).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I lost 5-10 lbs as well when I stopped drinking Soda.  I believe it came not from caloric deficit (I notice their is no mention of how much soda he drank)...but from the reduction of sugar.

Couldn&#039;t this particular anecdote be explained by Paleo diet principles?

Admittedly, there could be overlap between the two, but I see this as one of the weaker examples of Shangri-la proof that have  been presented.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chuck,
   I actually do drink more weak tea than I did sodas. When I did the soda thing, I also drank about as much ice water as I did soda. Well, without measuring, it seemed to me to be about the same. When I switched, I pretty much quit drinking ice water at all and now just drink tea. Water is so boring.

   I find it interesting that I didn&#039;t think to put these little details in my initial description. Y&#039;all&#039;s questions pushed me to remember and to describe them. It&#039;s a good thing I wasn&#039;t trying to publish this in a scientific journal - the referees would have bounced it for being irreproduceable. (and JIR probably wouldn&#039;t have taken it as being too factual.)

   Oh, another detail, which I don&#039;t know whether it matters or not: from Labor Day to Memorial Day, I still always had two sodas a week when I volunteered at the Monday Night concert and got them free. I did take bottles of frozen tea to the summer music festivals instead of buying sodas.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks nix.  I will definitely check that out.  I will drink more water period, if it is mineral water.  Something about the carbonation that helps replace the diet soda.  

Come to think of it vs.  I began the switch to mineral water when I was doing Atkins.  It was his recommendations that helped me make the change.  That did help with the diet and helped me lose about 60 lbs on it.  My moods eventually  became so awful while doing super low-carb that I cannot stick with it.  I just try to stay away from sugar now.  SLD is so much easier and takes away many of those cravings, and especially diminishes the desire to get seconds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jeff,
   I don&#039;t think switching away from drinking soda had anything to do with it. Remember that I switched from sodas to sugared water (well, weak tea), not to plain water with no calories. With a cup of sugar per gallon, I think it had around the same number of calories. Or at least I once counted calories given my typical consumptions of each and decided that it wasn&#039;t enough to make a difference, much less that much difference.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi rphil,

I don&#039;t know how much my waist size changed. I retired a couple of years before that and switched from fitted pants to elastic waistbands, since I didn&#039;t have to dress up anymore. I might have noticed something the once I had to wear a suit, but wearing the suit was so unpleasant in itself that I didn&#039;t.

		<description><![CDATA[In response to Justin and others- I also find diet cola seems to increase cravings and induces me to drink more diet cola. It may be best for some people to avoid it, even if just to save money as Pat did with regular cola.

I would also be curious if anyone has a theory on this. A starting position might be that some diet soft drinks still impact blood sugar and insulin, whether through caffeine and/or artificial sweeteners:

“Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revolution” recommends diet soft drinks sweetened with sucralose rather than aspartame. Dr. Atkins notes sucralose does not raise blood sugar. He also encouraged people to avoid caffeine, as excessive caffeine can cause unstable blood sugar.

In “Good Calories Bad Calories” Gary Taubes describes the animal research of Stylianos Nicolaidis, where rats secreted insulin in response to the mere taste of a sweet substance. It did not matter whether the sweet substance was sugar or a no-calorie sugar substitute.]]></description>
