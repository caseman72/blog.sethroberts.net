		<description><![CDATA[I agree that novelty has additional effects outside of the traditional norm. Usually not controlled for in studies. I also find this effect in other areas like excersize and pointless to state the obvious &quot;learning&quot;. 

Id like Seth to comment on the effects Of chronic novelty as applied to food or anything else for that matter. 

Would this cancel out the &quot;set point&quot; mechanism in the long run and force the body to seek an alternative. What would that alternative be?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing that bothers me about this studies is how often they make up the &quot;mediterranean diet&quot; Being from Spain I can asure you that the proposed diet does no resembles our traditional food. whole cereals were unheard of until a decade or so. Low.-fat dairy was a niche product and margarine was started to being use at the begining of the 90&#039;s (and because it spreads easier on bread) Another thing that always bothers me is how devoid of legumes are these &quot;so called&quot; mediterranean diets. I don&#039;t know about the rest of the mediterranean contries but in spain legumes are a staple food.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think this is a Mediterranean diet since it contains  &quot; low-fat dairy products and margarines”.  I would also question what oils were included (only olive oil = Mediterranean)

The hilarious thing is, by travestying the Med diet, the study owners probably thought they were improving it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I explain those results by assuming that when the set point is already low, changing the diet doesn&#039;t lower it. Only when the set point has been raised by smell-calorie associations do you get the loss-followed-by-regain effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I eat a monotonous, non-rewarding diet, does that counteract the effects of familiarity? Because I can lose weight eating the same thing every day, it solves the problem of what to eat, which is half the problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Puzzling, then, how an experiment could radically change the subjects diet and yet weight stays stable.  From http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/05/food-reward-dominant-factor-in-obesity.html :

&quot;The first thing they report is what happened when they fed two lean people using the machine, for 16 or 9 days. Both of them maintained their typical calorie intake (~3,075 and ~4,430 kcal per day) and maintained a very stable weight during this period.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your theory supports the idea to eat local, in season food. If people eat whole foods (which itself encourages weight loss) and rotate foods every three months or so, they would never gain weight because every three months they would be eating new foods, hence causing weight loss! Cool.]]></description>
