		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;It is reasonable to plot a rank of 1 lower than a rank of 100 — because 1 is less than 100. &lt;/i&gt;

Not in sales ranks, it&#039;s not.  But maybe I&#039;m just projecting because I personally had trouble flipping the graph upside down to understand it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think referrals from blogs is a likely explanation. My blog linked to you a number of times starting Feb 26, and did two dedicated posts Mar 22 and Mar 24, with more posts since. We have 24,000 monthly unique visitors. An Amazon sales rank of 40,000 is probably about 2 copies per day. That could easily be generated by blog referrals. 

You might try checking your referrer traffic to see where web traffic was coming from, and also go back farther than April to see when the sales surge started.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Man, I should submit that RankTracer graph to Junk Charts.  Why would you graph something where higher is better with higher at the bottom, and why would you produce a graph that gave equal weight to a move between 50,050 and 50,000 and a move between #50 and #1?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you fit a straight line to all the points in the lower graph it would have a negative slope. (I did so and the slope had a very high t value -- that is, was extremely unlikely to be negative by chance.) Perhaps next time I make such a graph I will include a fitted straight line. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard about fat set point in exactly that way, from Stephen Guyenet&#039;s recent posting and interviews. That is what led me to buy the book last month and also read this blog on a regular basis. Mark Sisson has also been singing Seth&#039;s praises recently.  It would be interesting to compare the uptick in sales to the blog readership over time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yeah, that&#039;s a good point. I hadn&#039;t thought of that. On the other hand, being mentioned here or there should simply produce a spike in sales. Perhaps there are such spikes -- too small to be clear -- but a series of spikes would not produce steady improvement across months, except by coincidence. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[a very well followed biologist Dr. stephen guyenet has posted recently about this exact theory which caused quite a stir in the nutritional blog sphere (http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/), no doubt the references made to your work in this field were noted and likely resulted in people seeking you out and buying your book.

kudos!]]></description>
