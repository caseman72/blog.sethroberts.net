		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know the fraction of problems vs. non-problems.  Recall that homosexuality was apparently a problem prior to 1973 -- but then suddenly ceased being a problem.  Now, apparently, shyness is a problem worthy of medical attention.

Angell&#039;s point (or one of them) is that the ever-expanding scope of the DSM is an underhanded attempt by the psychiatric establishment to medicalize (problemetize?) the range of normal human traits and behaviors.

I&#039;m not really a big fan of Thomas Szasz, but for whatever it&#039;s worth, see this essay about his views on the DSM:  http://www.themoralliberal.com/2010/12/20/the-illegitimacy-of-the-%E2%80%9Cpsychiatric-bible%E2%80%9D/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So far as restless leg syndrome is concerned, I have a friend who&#039;s plagued by it-- if she doesn&#039;t take meds for RLS, she can&#039;t get nearly enough sleep. There may be some other solution (I&#039;ve heard a little good stuff about acupuncture), but meds seem to be legitimate for that one. 

On the other hand, I can&#039;t see why it&#039;s filed under psychiatry. It&#039;s pretty clearly neurological, with no emotional or cognitive component.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[regarding increasing diagnoses--why do we even need a formal diagnostic manual?  doctor&#039;s obviously want to get a handle on what people have, and will use words to express problems, and if they have a set of official diagnoses, then they might be constrained in what they would diagnose.  &#039;it must be one of these diagnoses on this table.&#039;  in other words, getting rid of official tables of diagnoses would allow for many more possible diagnoses, and inventions of diagnoses.  french is guarded by a body that approves words that are &#039;officially&#039; french, while english doesn&#039;t--which language do you think is going to be more expressive in the long run?

two, freud and his disciples seem to be getting bashes too much.  where&#039;s the appreciative thinking?  he seemed to apply the empirical approach to introspection and challenged orthodoxy, trusting his lying eyes over authority, very much in the spirit of self experimentation.  his disciples often seemed to do this too, breaking with freud.  i think albert ellis was a freudian, and then he went his own way and developed an obviously effective cognitive behavioral approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the issue is whether the problem exists in the first place, or whether the DSM contains a bunch of self-serving pseudo-diagnoses that allow the mental-health industry to prescribe harmful &quot;treatments&quot;, dis-empower people, and further entrench the &lt;i&gt;status quo&lt;/i&gt;.  See, for example:

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;She does not say why this is bad. Maybe she thinks it’s obvious. It isn’t obvious to me.&quot;

I&#039;d guess she&#039;s talking about hypermedicalization of situations that do not really warrant a medical treatment, or at least a treatment with drugs. Maybe she&#039;s confusing both of these (e.g. prescribing changes in exercise patterns or diet rather than drugs), but that&#039;s the general point I think she&#039;s trying to make.]]></description>
