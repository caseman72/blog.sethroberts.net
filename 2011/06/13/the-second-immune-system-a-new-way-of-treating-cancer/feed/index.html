		<description><![CDATA[I stand corrected, my facts about the lack of results from Burzynski&#039;s treatments came from various websites such as Mayo Clinic, Dr. Weil, and cancer.org, who must be trotting the party line about the trials being ineffective, which it turns out are likely based on flawed trials that were done intentionally incorrectly.

In the documentary, Burzynski claims a 27.5% success rate in curing cancers otherwise thought to be incurable.  This is astonishing because the cancers are otherwise uniformly fatal.  He doesn&#039;t give a whole lot of other numbers, but through the absurdly lengthly and intense legal campaign by the FDA, they never contested the effectiveness of this treatment.

Assuming the documentary is mostly true, what bothers me more about the poor treatment of Burzynski is the fact that what looks to be a very viable treatment for cancer has been tied up in this stupid pissing contest for more than 20 years.  Burzynski made his discoveries in the 1980&#039;s and the treatment is only now being seriously studied.  It makes you wonder how many other treatments for how many other diseases will never see the light of day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. At first it seems paradoxical. In a health care system desperately in need of innovation, two government or quasi-governmental agencies (the Texas Board of  Medical Examiners and the FDA) do their best to &lt;strong&gt;block&lt;/strong&gt; innovation. Later, of course, it makes sense: Because established powers are allowed to do this sort of thing, that&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; we have profound stagnation. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apparently one can still watch the video for FREE, because I just did.

It made me very, very angry. It should make anyone who watches it very, very angry.

It also made me ashamed to be an American. That this can happen in this country? Unbelievable.  I don&#039;t know a better way to put it.

To UncleLongHair: The numbers are available in the film. On the other hand, you seem to be missing the point. It&#039;s not the numbers, it&#039;s the way the government and Big Pharma work together to steal, cheat, lie, and to KILL people, and still are.

In my opinion, it&#039;s time for torches and pitchforks.

		<description><![CDATA[I would love to believe that this guy is on to something.  But the facts are pretty scarce.  He has reportedly treated about 8,000 people at his clinic.  Treatment costs between $30-60k (from the web site).  There are absolutely no numbers available for his success rate, remission rate, etc.  There are about a dozen success stories on the web site.

8,000 patients at $30-60k apiece is $240-480 million.  The total dollars is probably less than that adjusted for inflation and the treatment was probably not that expensive when he started out.  Even so, that is a heck of a lot of money for a small clinic to bring in, and he can&#039;t be bothered to publish any results?]]></description>
