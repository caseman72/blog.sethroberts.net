		<description><![CDATA[I recently bumped into your theories looking for something to explain the same patterns, I&#039;ve never tracked my weight data like Justin but I&#039;ve found the exact same pattern with weight loss and your diet--SLD--seems like a sound idea. I haven&#039;t had a chance to read your book but I did buy the ebook, and am looking foward to reading about your ideas. I&#039;ve always noticed that when I eat  a variety of foods my stomach stays flat vs. when I eat e.g. paleo or a LC, Ray Peat or some variation/combo of that.

I&#039;m an undergrad anthropology student and I think exploring this idea will make for some interesting papers for class; I think you have a good model here. It&#039;s too bad that this idea doesn&#039;t have more exposure this is really a breath of fresh air and seems to be able to explain a lot more about weight loss/gain than your standard eat this stay away from that. There is real intelligence in this idea.

I&#039;d really be interested to see how regulation hormones change during the weight loss and weight gain periods.]]></description>
