		<description><![CDATA[&quot;What would you have the medical community do that satisfies you that they are earnestly working on preventing, say, diabetes?&quot; Right now, research money is about 99% cure (study of possible cures) and 1% prevention. This is insane. It is wonderful for the people inside the research community and ordinary doctors, who benefit from that allocation. (Doctors benefit because it means more people will need to be cured -- by them.) It is horrible for everyone else. When the percentages are reversed (99% of research money goes to studying how to prevent, 1% how to cure) I will know they are serious. 

&quot;Aren’t you just being a bit sore about the fact that the medical community isn’t just accepting your assertions that your diet is the silver bullet of weight control?&quot; I don&#039;t think my diet is the silver bullet of weight control. I do think my diet introduces an entirely new idea into our understanding of weight control and how we handle obesity. I found that something that absolutely should not work according to all prevailing wisdom -- including the wisdom of the low-carbers -- does work. Rather than &quot;accept [my] assertions&quot; the medical community should test my assertions. But with one exception (Lisa Kaufmann) they haven&#039;t.

It isn&#039;t just diabetes of course. The medical community&#039;s record on prevention is terrible. Prevent heart disease by prescribing statins? Just one problem: They don&#039;t prevent heart disease. Oops. Prevent depression? Never heard of it. Prevent arthritis? Never heard of it. Prevent cancer? Uh, doctors discourage patients from smoking -- a 50-year-old idea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;For example, we treat diabetes rather than prevent it.&quot;  Seth, you remind me of people in my country complaining about high crime rates, pleading, &quot;Somebody should DO SOMETHING!&quot;  Without being very specific at all about what &quot;do something&quot; might entail.

What would you have the medical community do that satisfies you that they are earnestly working on preventing, say, diabetes?  Would you like to see medical practitioners applying to courts to have their patients declared legally incompetent, in order to inter them in starving houses?  Hold guns to their patients&#039; heads and MAKE them lose weight?

Aren&#039;t you just being a bit sore about the fact that the medical community isn&#039;t just accepting your assertions that your diet is the silver bullet of weight control?  That instead they recommend &quot;eat less, move more&quot; and leave it up to their patient to decide how (or if!) to achieve that, without specifically recommending your diet?  Without actual hard evidence that a particular method works, it wouldn&#039;t be appropriate for a medical practitioner to be pushing any one method.  Asking them to do so under the guise of &quot;It is both cheap and safe&quot; is to propose a sort of dietary Pascal&#039;s wager.  From a distance your diet looks just like any other fad diet.  Without significant investment in time, I cannot determine if your diet works any better than, say, eating only raw meat.

I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s reasonable to hold party A (the doctor) accountable for a recommendation they make (to lose weight - somehow!) that party B (the patient) doesn&#039;t follow through with personal research and ACTION.  If you&#039;re into transactional analysis a la Berne you&#039;ll see the problem here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Murca. Hail. yeah: In December, the Los Angeles Times reported — very briefly — that from 2007 to 2008, life expectancy in the United States declined by 0.1 year.

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s very interesting and helpful. I agree that the steady decline in age-adjusted death rates since 1980 does not suggest stagnation. But the usual stagnation claim -- &quot;improvements in life expectancy have slowed down&quot; -- is not about early in 1980-2009 versus late in 1980-2009 but comparison of much earlier (e.g., 1930-1960) to later (e.g., 1980-2010). The statement &quot;these reductions are harder to achieve&quot; is not an explanation (&quot;hence&quot;) of the slowdown but a description of it. The big picture, as far as I can tell with this new data, is what the USC authors described: Over the last 30 years, people are living somewhat longer after they get sick, but they are getting sick at the same age. This makes sense given the overwhelming emphasis of our health care system on keeping symptoms from getting worse relative to prevention of those symptoms. For example, we treat diabetes rather than prevent it. This is a kind of stagnation all by itself: A problem becomes large (e.g., diabetes) but all you ever do is treat it. Okay, people with diabetes live a bit longer, but progress on prevention remains stagnant at roughly zero.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is seriously misleading.

Go here: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr59/nvsr59_04.pdf

Scroll down to Figure 1, on p.31.

You will see that the 2008 increase was a blip in the long-term trend of a steady decades-long decrease in mortality rates.

Here&#039;s the real story from that figure: Today, we are avoiding over a QUARTER of the deaths that would have occured if death rates had not changed over the last 30 years. That&#039;s freaking amazing. (Yes, that&#039;s aggregate and hides shamefully high levels of differential mortality, but still! A QUARTER! And it&#039;s not like people were dying like flies in 1980.)


Why look at mortality rather than life expectancy? Because life expectancy is a complicated transformation of mortality rates, and even large improvements in mortality don&#039;t translate into large increases in life expectancy in low-mortality countries. 

From http://www.deathreference.com/Ke-Ma/Life-Expectancy.html: &quot;Since the middle of the twentieth century, gains in life expectancy have been due more to medical factors that have reduced mortality among older persons. These reductions are harder to achieve than decreases in infant mortality; hence, improvements in life expectancy at birth have slowed down.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Quigley, in my book I show that my initial use of sugar water and extra-light olive oil (ELOO) led to a weight loss that was sustained at least 5 years. Now I do the diet using butter (nose-clipped) -- a healthier calorie source than ELOO or sugar water. In 1990 I weighed 200 pounds. That&#039;s when I started trying to lose weight. Making dietary changes that led to my theory and that the theory later explained, including the Shangri-La Diet, I have been well below 200 pounds ever since. I&#039;m now about 170 pounds. That&#039;s more than 20 years of sustained weight loss. I think that low-carb diets work, too, but I believe they work for the same reason the Shangri-La Diet works -- by reducing the overall strength of smell-calorie associations in your diet, they reduce your setpoint. Before I discovered SLD, I lost about 6 pounds by no longer eating bread. It never came back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bill, thank you for bringing that document to my attention. It shows that the 1918 influenza epidemic was by far the biggest disaster in terms of life expectancy in the past 100 years. As you say, life expectancy has declined several other times.The overall trend is unquestionably a slowing down of the rate of increase. The fact that the overall rate of increase is slowing down at the same time that the number of year-to-year declines is decreasing (as you point out) suggests that improvement in data quality (less random error) is why the number of year-to-year declines is decreasing.

It shows that the 1918 influenza epidemic was by far the biggest disaster in terms of life expectancy in the past 100 years. As you say, life expectancy has declined several other times.The overall trend is unquestionably a slowing down of the rate of increase. The fact that the overall rate of increase is slowing down at the same time that the number of year-to-year declines is decreasing (as you point out) suggests that improvement in data quality (less random error) is why the number of year-to-year declines is decreasing. As data quality increases, each decline becomes more significant.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[According to the report &quot;Life Expectancy in the United States&quot; by the Congressional Research Service, at: http://aging.senate.gov/crs/aging1.pdf, since 1910 life expectancy has declined about 20 times-the last time before  2007-08 in 1993. Clearly it is an important event for some of the reasons mentioned but it does seem to happen, luckily, with decreasing frequency over time: 5 times in the 10s; 5 times in the 20s; twice in the 30s; twice in the 40s; once in the 50s; 3 times 60s; once in the 80s; once in the 90s and once in the 2000s. Looks like improvement to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Quigley, I started the Shangri-La diet on October 22, 2009 when I weighed about 222 lbs.  At my lowest point since then, I weighed about 191.  I&#039;m currently hovering around 194, for a net loss of about 28 lbs.  (I know it&#039;s not quite two years.)

Here&#039;s a quick-and-dirty graph that&#039;s current as of July 4, 2011. The solid, darker line is a ten-day moving average.

		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Roberts:

I&#039;ve tried to find data that your diet works for SUSTAINED weight reduction in a study that would be applicable to a generalizable population. As you know, temporary weight loss is relatively easy. Sustained weight loss (wt loss &gt; 2 yrs), is hard. 

If your diet can do it, I&#039;d prescribe it every day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[quigley, you write: &quot;the medical community has pushed decreased food intake and increased exertion to treat one of the leading consequences of obesity, Type 2 diabetes. Patients don’t do it.&quot;

I agree. The medical community has pushed that solution for at least 50 years. And patients don&#039;t do it -- meaning it is a bad solution. That is a sign of stagnation I don&#039;t mention in this post: Ancient solutions that don&#039;t work well continue to be promoted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First, disclosure. I&#039;m an MD who spends &quot;vast amounts...on research&quot; as a basic and clinical researcher.

Second, where we agree:
a. Falling life expectancy is a shame on our society.
b. Losing weight means eating less. How you get there and how much royalty you collect off books sales are details.

Now where we disagree:
Specifically regarding obesity and its consequences, the medical community has pushed decreased food intake and increased exertion to treat one of the leading consequences of obesity, Type 2 diabetes. Patients don&#039;t do it.

If your diet is so great, the medical community will applaud you, and overweight people will build statues in your honor, just like they did with Atkins...right?

An important reason that cancer rates have increased is better detection. Please include this in your discussion. 

BTW, MD&#039;s in medical research make ~ 1/2 what they could in private practice on the whole. No one&#039;s in this game just to be paid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post.  It&#039;ll probably take someone you describe as an outsider with insider knowledge to really bring this issue into the public spotlight.

As for where these absurd health theories come from in the first place, I believe it stems from the contamination of politics into the research domain.  When politicians make it their job to fund science and make public health guidelines, they do so 1) before the science has settled, and often reach incorrect conclusions, then 2) direct research almost exclusively in the direction of confirming rather than falsifying public health recommendations, eliminating the marketplace of competing idea.  Science ceases to be science and you reach stagnation.]]></description>
