		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

&quot;I have yet to find a well-written book about language evolution&quot;

Everyone points me to Pinker&#039;s books on this topic. I was wondering what you thought of his popular writings?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I believe that we should read only those books that bite and sting us.  If a book we are reading does not rouse us with a blow to the head, then why read it?  Because it will make us happy, you tell me?  My God, we would also be happy if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy we could, if necessary, write ourselves.  What we need are books that affect us like some really grievous misfortune, like the death of one whom we loved more than ourselves, as if we were banished to distant forests, away from everybody, like a suicide; a book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us.  That is what I believe.&quot; -- Franz Kafka, letter to Oskar Pollak, January 27, 1904]]></description>
