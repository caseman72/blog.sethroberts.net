		<description><![CDATA[I am interested in beginning making yogurt and kefir.  Where do I obtain kefir grains?  Can store bought yogurt/kefir work?

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: You can use store-bought yogurt to make yogurt, yes. It is hard to get kefir grains. You can probably use store-bought kefir to make kefir, but I haven&#039;t tried it.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The best way is to use raw whole milk, kefir grains, and allow to ferment for two days or so at room temp. Heating can kill some of the valuable microorganisms, and you don&#039;t want to do that. Also, the higher the ambient temp (to a point), the faster the fermentation process happens.

Store-bought kefir has been pasteurized, so many of the microorganisms that make up the kefir colony have been killed. The resulting kefir is then less nutritionally valuable. Making kefir from the store-bought stuff is not the best technique for this reason.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It works with pasteurized milk directly from the fridge. No need to heat or warm. I used store bought kefir for a few batches and then got some grains and have been using it for 14 months. But I read on the net that store kefir is prepared with starter culture which does not contain as many types of probiotics as grain fermented kefir. I asked one manufacturer about it but did not get a response. I prefer grains because of that.
Kefir helped with my hay fever. Did not clear it completely but alleviated the symptoms. I am a believer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lazy mans kefir:

I just buy a carton of kefir, and let it ferment for about two days
at room temperature, so the carton gets roundish. 
Then I shake it, open it, drink some, and put it in the fridge.

The point, in addition to me being lazy, is that it is not legal
to sell sufficiently fermented kefir, so I let it ferment some more.]]></description>
