I&#039;m one of those people who has a streak of &quot;I&#039;ve never heard of that, let me try it&quot;, and I&#039;m moderately fat. I grant that I don&#039;t get new flavors that often, but mere newness (as distinct from something like strong bitterness, which I simply don&#039;t like) is fun rather than off-putting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John W, yes, this should work. You could also sprinkle the cucumbers with sugar -- that should make you like the smell of cucumbers. Several years ago I heard of an experiment that did just that: caused people to like vegetables more by adding sugar. The preference remained after the sugar was removed.]]></description>
