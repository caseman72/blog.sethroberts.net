		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Is your dentist a &#039;regular&#039; dentist or a &#039;holistic&#039; dentist? Many anti-amalgamists claim there is special training required to safely remove amalgams.

How much does it cost to have amalgams replaced? I&#039;m trying to find out if the holistic folks charge significantly more than a regular dentist would, but Google isn&#039;t turning up much, because most folks don&#039;t like to list costs online.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

I&#039;ve been wanting to remove my amalgam fillings for quite some time now.

But I haven&#039;t found a dentist who had something that I trusted as a safe replacement. Most composites contain either bisphenol A or nanoparticles. And polymerisation of the composites is never 100%, so there could be stuff leaking into your body, if I&#039;ve understood well.

I&#039;m interested in any info on fillings that seem safe to you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had read about this a long time ago, but did not want to get my fillings removed because I had read that this could be dangerous too, by releasing more Hg during the removal. And I did not know of a dentist who would remove them anyway.

So I was pleasntly surprised a couple of years ago when my dentist told me I needed a filling replaced and he was going to use some kind of space age plastic resin. I asked why, and he said that he thought the Hg amalgam might be unhealthy, and there was finally something that was sturdy enough to use instead.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth, did you take any precautionary supplements or steps before or after the removals?  

The info on how and if to remove amalgams seems way to convoluted, It would be nice to find more successful detailed stories.  There just doesn&#039;t appear to be any referenced and creditable resources of science plus testimonials.  Any thoughts? 

Thanks for all you do!]]></description>
