		<description><![CDATA[A variant of the von Neumann quote, &quot;There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn’t mind who gets the credit,&quot; is allegedly one of Ronald Reagan&#039;s favorites.

I think he meant the sentiment for others, though, since a sign featuring these words is, without a hint of irony, available for purchase in the gift shop of the vast and wildly expensive hilltop shrine Reagan built to himself in Simi Valley, California.

		<description><![CDATA[It reminds me of another old saying.
There was a firm that used to sell a kit of body parts so that you could make a Ford Escort look like a Porsche 911. When Ferdinand Porsche was asked if he was bothered about this, he said. &quot;No, I but would be really worried if there was a kit to make a Porsche look like a Ford&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chinese plagiarize something?  No, all they have to do is make a few changes and it is no longer plagiary.  I was shocked when I saw the 2001 &quot;Beijing Bicycle&quot;.  It was such an out and out copy of De Sica&#039;s classic, &quot;Bicycle Thief&quot; that it was unbelievable that the director would have the guts to put it on the international market.  All he had to do was say that he had adapted it from De Sica&#039;s movie, and that would have been ok.   But I have never seen him say that in any place....and I looked.]]></description>
