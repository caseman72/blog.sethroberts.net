		<description><![CDATA[“IRB mission creep”

My best personal experience were my two stints at NIH.  My first started in the early 90&#039;s.  My sign up, papers, contract, finger printing, etc. involved 2 bureaucrats and about 1.5 h.  The only mandatory courses that I needed to take were in radiation safety and laboratory safety.  During that time, Clinton &amp; Gore were on the &quot;efficiency in government&quot; kick and Harold Varmus held them to their word.  The campus was amazingly open.  You could walk onto campus (parking was impossible) and into any lab on campus, save the Human Genome Center which was under constant threat from animal rights activists.  Amazingly, hardly anything changed while I was there except it became easier to get orders processed.

From the late 90&#039;s to 2005, rules, regulation &amp; bureaucracy exploded.  The formal paper signing took almost a whole day.  It was interspersed with talks from bureaucrats (powerpoint-bulleted enhanced).  Funny thing was radiation and lab safety were not required, but perhaps 8 other online courses were.  Being bureaucratically-challenged, I ignored them until a frantic call came from the Institute&#039;s main office saying that I would not get paid until I completed them.

Moreover, it had been turned into &quot;Fort NIH&quot;.  The past openness was gone.  There were some labs where I could not just drop in as I passed by: I had to call in advance and have my name put on a list and then I could pass through airport like security.  

The best science, there and elsewhere, was performed in laboratories (Sections in NIH speak) which had ~5-10 members and there was an active community of related labs with weekly interaction.  The size of these communities was ~100-200 researchers in which ideas and materials flowed freely.  The small labs were under constant assault from the Empires of NIH headed by Gallo-like lab chiefs seeking to conquer and expand.  These labs produced interesting results inversely proportional and mpu&#039;s geometrically proportional to their size.

I haven&#039;t looked at the numbers but I would expect that bureaucracy creep has increased overall spending without a similar increase in spending on research and bench science.  

Sorry for the ramble, but I&#039;ll end with one last question:

Is there an equivalent to the Paleo Diet for institutions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, especially with this:


&lt;blockquote&gt;
Making a life of debunking creationists and homeopaths does not lead to anything new and innovative, nor does it lead to a better understanding of evolution and disease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I also like your comparison of creation science and climate science.

I would add two things. One is that having a job pushes the job holder toward playing it safe. Playing it safe and science don&#039;t work well together, as you say. The other is that rules and regulations about science, ostensibly for the benefit of the public, flourish and grow (&quot;IRB mission creep&quot;) because jobs are created to enforce them. The more paperwork the bureaucrats can generate, the more people they can hire to process the paperwork, the larger their budget, and the more important they feel. This is a disaster for the public, which has no idea of the deadening effect of IRBs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Thanks for alerting me to Conway&#039;s Law -- I had never heard of it.

I agree with your thoughts on quackbusters.  Making a life of debunking creationists and homeopaths does not lead to anything new and innovative, nor does it lead to a better understanding of evolution and disease.  If only they would train their eye to uncover foundations of some modern scientific beliefs, say climate science.  But, they would be branded as heretics.  

An aside.  I find creation science/ID and popular climate science to be quite similar: both are lazy and unimaginative.  Creation scientist: I can&#039;t imagine how such complexity arose, therefore god must have done it.   Climate scientist:  I can&#039;t think of a natural explanation for this observed change in the weather, therefore it must be CO2.  I don&#039;t want to cast aspersions on all climate scientists, since some are actually doing interesting stuff.  But, you will never hear about their work in the popular scientific press.

Derivative science is indeed pernicious.  My thesis adviser had a name for it: sandwich science.  Take two slices of known and insert a little unknown between them.  Voila!  Science! An mpu (minimal publishing unit)!

My model of the scientific enterprise is one of a hunter/gatherer society.  Most scientists are gatherers.  They go out and do their experiments and gather data.  Hunters work on the edges of knowledge and explore new lands.  They are not productive according to the gatherer metric and are often wrong.  Nevertheless, the hunters are the innovators and are necessary for the advancement of science.  

The two need each other to survive.  Indeed, the mythology of science celebrates the hunters (e.g., Einstein), allowing them to be tolerated and to feed from the gatherer&#039;s work.  This tolerance derives from the need for fat and protein (new theory to explore) that the hunters provide.

But, just as hunter/gatherer societies evolved into farming societies, the pursuit of science has evolved.  The current academic/industrial scientific complex resembles farms on which scientific results are grown.  Along with this farming society come the politicians and bureaucrats with their rules and regulations that will eventually lead to the depletion of nutrients (innovation) from the scientific soil.  

My tongue in cheek saying is:

Scientists figure out how things work.
Engineers figure out how to make things work.
Businessmen figure out how to sell it.
Politicians, thinking themselves experts in all of the above, come in a screw things up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The best supported widespread cause of obesity I know of is the one that very strongly correlates antibodies to a particular rhinovirus with obesity.  Unless somebody can show that only obese people catch that cold, or that only obese people continue to express that antibody, it really looks as if this particular cold actually leaves a propensity to obesity in its wake.

The mechanism remains unknown  Does it cause addiction to fructose?  Reduced metabolic rate?  Increased muscle pain after exercise? Insatiety? Your guess is as good as mine, maybe better. I wonder if anybody is actually looking into it, as a day job. The best we can do now is to stay away from fat people suffering colds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;the science they are criticizing may be the best those professional scientists can produce, given the system within which they work. &quot;

Are you familiar with the work of W E Deming ? Your remark here reminded me strongly of his statement on Quality (in the context of industrial production) that it is c 96% determined by the system in which the worker is working, and c4% by the worker. Hence, if you want to improve quality, you should focus on improving the system. Sounds to me like Science is the same.]]></description>
