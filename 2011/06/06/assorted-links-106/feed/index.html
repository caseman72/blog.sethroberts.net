		<description><![CDATA[Those suggestions do not agree with my experience. You can get really thick yogurt using milk -- no need to use cream. Use a long fermentation time, such as 24 or 30 hours, at constant temperature. And I found that my yogurt improved when I used less starter. I use 1/4 teaspoon -- much less than Hoffman&#039;s 1 tablespoon. However, you can certainly get thin yogurt using this recipe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of yogurt, did you ever happen to read Abbie Hoffman&#039;s yogurt-making tips from _Steal This Book_?  They sound pretty sensible to me, but I&#039;ve never tried to use them to the letter:

&quot;...Begin by going to a Turkish or Syrian restaurant and buying some yogurt to go. Some restaurants boast of yogurt that goes back over a hundred years. Put it in the refrigerator.  Now prepare the culture in which the yogurt will multiply. The consistency you want will determine what you use. A milk culture will produce thin yogurt, while sweet cream will make a thicker batch. It&#039;s the butter fat content that determines the consistency and also the number of calories. Half milk and half cream combines the best of both worlds. Heat a quart of half and half on a low flame until just before the boiling point and remove from the stove. This knocks out other bacteria that will compete with the yogurt. Now take a tablespoon of the yogurt you got from the restaurant and place it in the bottom of a bowl (not metal). Now add the warm liquid. Cover the bowl with a lid and wrap tightly with a heavy towel. Place the bowl in a warm spot such as on top of a radiator or in a sunny window. A turned-off oven with a tray of boiling water placed in it will do well. Just let the bowl sit for about 8 hours (overnight). The yogurt simply grows until the whole bowl is yogurt. Yippie! It will keep in the refrigerator for about two weeks before turning sour, but even then, the bacteria will produce a fresh batch of top quality. Remember when eating it to leave a little to start the next batch...&quot;]]></description>
