		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently dealing with the change in the online federal student loan servicer website (kept getting errors and such last week when trying to access my information, and now find out that the switch apparently involved losing the autopay I&#039;ve had set up for years and have a past-due amount because it didn&#039;t do the auto-pay last week - meanwhile, the customer service phone number has a message that states that it can&#039;t be reached &quot;right now - try calling back later&quot;), so the Reclamations essays are definitely striking a chord today.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that&#039;s a good point about the rarity of science as the reason for our beliefs. So when science -- science that actually worked -- came into the world, a new (and to some extent higher-prestige) way of forming beliefs, it was predictable that people would continue to use the old ways of producing belief but claim they were using the new way -- for example, Scientology, much of evidence-based medicine, much of the AGW argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I need a name for the set of standard causes of belief. This post caused me to google it up - it&#039;s called ethnoepistemology.

It&#039;s undeniable that science-type reason is only a few percent of ethnoepistemology. The rationalizations generated when you ask students about their opinions are neither for justifying those opinions nor very often for spreading them. I&#039;m not sure what they&#039;re for.]]></description>
