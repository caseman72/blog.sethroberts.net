		<description><![CDATA[Paul, the answers to your questions are no and no. When I brew tea, variations in brewing time and whether I wash the tea or not have made clear differences. The tea -- and its price -- remain the same. So far with green tea, I have only tried three varieties and within that tiny sample, yes, the more expensive is better. But there are so many green teas and some are so expensive I am sure that there is a price above which the more expensive teas are not noticeably better. In the big world of tea (not just green tea), my favorite teas have not been expensive. However, that was before I started learning from these side-by-side comparisons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Paul, you ask &quot;Why are your comparisons always evaluative instead of merely descriptive?&quot; It isn&#039;t &quot;instead of&quot;; it&#039;s &quot; in addition to&quot;. In my experience, side-by-side comparisons increase both: I am more conscious of the differences between two things (e.g., two teas or the same tea brewed two different ways) and I care about the difference more. 

Why is there is a change in desirability (one of the things being compared becomes more desirable, i.e., &quot;better&quot;) not just better knowledge of the differences? My evolutionary explanation is: So that the experience will cause action. You pay more for the &quot;better&quot; one or become more likely to buy it. You compare X and Y side by side, X becomes more pleasant, you buy more X. Resources flow to the makers of X. That&#039;s the evolutionary point.

In the bigger economy, not just trading, I agree with you. For example, professors often rank their students based on how smart they are. Smarter being a synonym for &quot;better&quot;. Not a good idea. As you say, a lot is lost by such a narrow descriptive system.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, a question:  Why are your comparisons always evaluative instead of merely descriptive?  In other words, why do the differences between things always lead to the conclusion that one is BETTER than the other?

I like bitter lager when it&#039;s cold out and smooth lager when it&#039;s hot.  High-acidity, light-bodied coffee when I&#039;m taking my time over it; full-bodied coffee when I&#039;m knocking one back fast on my way to the subway.  And sometimes one is just in the mood for different things.

I think a side-by-side comparison has its uses, but if it&#039;s used strictly to decide &quot;what&#039;s better&quot; then (I suspect) a certain type of thing will always &quot;win&quot;---the type of thing with immediately obvious virtues, that wears its charm on the surface, as it were.  

The instinct to rank everything from best to worst tends to make complex things dull, in my opinion.  If I may make a pretty big digression, I always feel this way when the Winter Olympics are on and the poor figure skaters have to go through hell.  Figure skating is simply a far more complex thing than ski jumping or racing, and the attempt to rank performances in defiance of this fact reduces world class athletes to quivering choke machines every time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have long known of this effect, but I hadn&#039;t framed it quite this way.  I have a good memory for taste, so I am able to imagine foods side by side even if sampled at different times.  I have long tried to avoid even a taste of premium foodstuffs when offered to me, if I know that I will not be able to afford them after the free taste.  I was happy with my cheap tea, chocolate, cheese, etc., until I tried the better versions.  Now I am forced to compromise either my eating pleasure or my budget on the things where I didn&#039;t resist the taste.  Now I know what my problem is called!
One example where I have actually been successful to a small extent is tea.  I don&#039;t order the samples of the super premium teas from my tea catalog.  I could afford the sample but not the bulk, and I know that having had the sample I would probably be less satisfied with my merely premium tea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of years ago we were lucky enough to be invited to a Bordeaux wine dinner (my favorite wine at that time), featuring wines that STARTED at $85/bottle. 
I discovered that it would be foolish for me to spend (allowing that I could) over $250 a bottle, because my palate could not distinguish between the wines above that price level. Up to $250, I could taste differences; the one I liked best was not the most expensive, but close. 
This experiment (if I can call it that) left me with new ideas about professional wine tasters: can they REALLY tell the difference? I&#039;m skeptical, but if they can, they have my profound respect.]]></description>
