		<description><![CDATA[An interesting experiment you could try ia brewing the same tea, in the same conditiiba (water, temperature, time) but in different teapots (by exemple ceramic, yixing (clay), kyusus and gaiwan). You will notice some interesting differences in the taste. 

PS: The water temperature makes a huge difference, make sure you never use boiling water on green or white teas. Use a 75 degrees water on Japanese green teas and white teas and a 85 degrees water on Chinese green tea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi

Stray thought: My impression is that some cultures (eg: Italian) make it culturally acceptable to share dishes at the table, as their meals often consist of platters which contain numerous types of meat, cheese, bread, pickles, and so forth.

I think this would thus lead to a culture-wide connoisseur effect... which is what we have in Italy, with huge numbers of specialist cheeses, wines, and so forth.

Of course this is difficult to prove, but it might be quite nice to create a micro-culture of sharing food with friends and see if people become &quot;more foodie&quot; over time. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for these observations; I&#039;ll have to buy a scale and start experimenting.

How do you brew the Choco Late for 30 minutes without it losing too much heat?  Do you brew it in a saucepan on the stove?]]></description>
