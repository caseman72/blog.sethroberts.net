		<description><![CDATA[Usually when I cook, I often ask for feedback from my wife and or other guests and compare their experiences. I try to elicit as much description as possible and try to force comparisons with past memorable shared dishes. I make small changes each time I cook mostly with substitutions and not volumes. I usualy see much more changes than they do, but I also miss some observations. In a tapas I made recently my wife and her father tasted a sardine like flavor independently and without the others awareness. I didn&#039;t include any sardines but did use fish roe. Was there a genetic connection? I didn&#039;t taste sardines either. I am a foodie but forcing them to make comparisons on a regular basis has made them foodies as well. I find with non foodies in general mixing multiple brands of the same thing usually gets the response of &quot;it&#039;s better than usual&quot; . For example mixed rice, and mixed coffee brews.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That sounds like an interesting observation. I wonder whats the best way of making use of it? Developing a liking for tea is good if you want to drink more tea, but at this point in my life I dont see how I would benefit for developing connoseurship for wine, movies, or other trivial things. 

However, there can be certain qualities that would be very useful to develop. 
Developing a connoisseurship for clothing (something that most women aquire naturally through shopping) could allow one to rise in society faster. A connoisseurship in writing could allow one to become a better writer. 
The same could be said about speeches and any type of art or crafts. You could argue that developing a good taste in a field is necessary to advance in it (eg you need to be a connoisseur of indie films to make good indie films).

But what other hidden willat effects could one exploit? Could you become a connoisseur of productivity? A connoisseur of conversations? Why not see if you could compare two days of your life to each other? 

In theory you could compare any two things so long as you had them side by side and were mindful of the differences. 

There&#039;s so much potential here, where would you even start?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brian, that&#039;s very interesting. You write, &quot;if I lay out the dark blue pants against a black shirt, Iâ€™ll see it as blue&quot;. That sounds like an instance of seeing similarities (dark color) brings out differences (blue vs. black). Not needing to see differences in order to see similarities (which is also true). An instance of that is  comparing blue-black to white brings out the similarity between blue-black and red-black (both are dark).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a quick note: it seems like you&#039;re working with a taste-level instance of a broader phenomenon discussed by epistemologists: we need to see contrasts in order to see similarities.  If I have a very dark blue pair of pants, I&#039;ll tend to see them as black if I wear them with a white shirt.  But, if I lay out the dark blue pants against a black shirt, I&#039;ll see it as blue.  Same, even with the color black itself.  When I lay out blue-black against red-black against green-black, I can see the differences against each other.  But, if I take one at a time and put them against white, it will be harder to see.  Same with the color white!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are classic (in math ed circles) experiments where kids determine which of the mixes of orange juice and water will taste more like orange juice (for example, 1:2 vs. 3:4). The classic study is done on paper, presented as symbols or diagrams, which is sort of funny, in a sad way.

In the math club, we once played with making simple shakes out of milk, honey and cocoa. That was a lot of fun, and good math. Please blog if you work with kids on tea experiments - I&#039;d like to know how it works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Maria. I think of using the Willat Effect to teach young children science. It is fun to make the comparisons, the results aren&#039;t obvious (e.g., how long to brew tea), and the comparisons are tiny experiments. It is mini-science.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I quoted your post in application to mathematics education: http://www.naturalmath.com/blog/example-spaces-hedonic/

Apparently, there are some delicious complexities there. Check out this quote from a study: &quot;Surprisingly, induction pro?ted from spacing, even though massing apparently created a sense of ?uent learning: Participants rated massing as more effective than spacing, even after their own test performance had demonstrated the opposite.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another reference:

As blueberries go, the wild variety (&quot;lowbush&quot;) are the rock stars. The cultivated kind (&quot;highbush&quot;) can be planted anywhere, and grow in huge fields in places like New Jersey and Michigan. You&#039;re as likely to find either topping your cereal. Sometimes you&#039;ve got these big, fat berries bobbing in your milk, and other times you&#039;ll have tiny bold nuggets on your spoon. Do a taste test someday. The cultivated ones are watery and mealy compared to the tiny wild onesâ€”intense bursts of candy-like fruit. Once you notice the difference, you will never buy the fat ones again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would like to point out that your intention was originally to maximize pleasure, but your results indicate you minimized pleasure derived from at least one tea. It sounds like you used to be happy with any old green tea, but now you&#039;ve limited the range of acceptable teas by nurturing a disgust for some of them. It is only compounding the problem that the ones you do still enjoy (and would have enjoyed regardless) are more difficult to access. To think, you could have been content with the cheap stuff if you&#039;d never compared.

At least you have derived pleasure from the experiment!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that finding that the most expensive brand of foodstuff is always best reveals a built-in bias.  Taste testing must be blind as to brand and comparative price to eliminate this bias.

Anecdotally, while spending time in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA we visited various &quot;Southwest&quot; restaurants for lunch and dinner.  The best one was away from tourist districts in a blue-collar neighborhood, serving a wide variety of authentic central-American foods from various cultures.

It was neither fancy nor expensive, but the food was well prepared, the recipes were widely varied, the ingredients were top quality and fresh, wonderful.

Can&#039;t remember the name, couldn&#039;t find it now without a lot of driving around that part of town, but it was really popular with the local folks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As many others have noted, it really needs to a double-blind if you want to exclude price as a factor.

CLB and others note that price matters a lot - and I think the study that CLB quoted makes it clear that this is NOT unconscious snobbery or social climbing - price is actually a flavor - it is perceived as taste at the sensory level. More expensive things taste better because rarity is delicious.

The point in excluding price as a factor is not because it obscures reality (it *is* reality), but because you are stingy and cheap and want to minimize expenses :)

Since all taste is arbitrary anyway, you could go all the way and cultivate an appreciation of cheap flavors.]]></description>

Off topic sure, but kombucha is mentioned in the article.]]></description>
