		<description><![CDATA[Incandescent light will certainly affect your circadian rhythm.  In fact any light source which contains a blue component will suppress melatonin production.

This is due to the ganglion cells in our eyes.  They are sensitive to blue light as they connect to the pinel gland.  Blue light can travel through our eyelids and when it hits the ganglion cells, melatonin is suppressed and we become alert.  

When it&#039;s dark, melatonin production increases and we feel sleepy.  You can place yourself in &#039;virtual darkness&#039; by wearing blue blocking glasses.

I tried a number of different pairs of sunglasses without much success and ended up making my own very cheaply.  If you want to try them, google rodsnconesdotnet.  I&#039;d be grateful if people could tell me how they get on with them.

Best of luck

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Seth!

Have you heard about this Finnish product: http://www.valkee.com/uk/ ?

They report that in one study, subjects achieved a huge symptom relief rate with that product. However, the study report hasn&#039;t been published yet.

&quot;In Valkee’s CE medical device certification clinical trial, 92% of severely depressed seasonal affective disorder (also known as ‘winter blues’) patients experienced total symptoms relief in 4 weeks with 8-12 minutes of bright light via ear canal [8].&quot;

The product costs a huge amount of money here in Finland. Almost two hundred euros.


Hmm... I think that I should possibly try blue blockers. Are all eyeglasses with orange lenses sufficient to blockthe melatonin-suppressing effect of my computer screen?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth, 

F.lux sucks. It&#039;s too weak, and there&#039;s no way to fix it. 

I use redshift on LInux, which is quite powerful and actually does make a difference. 

When I switch from redshift to F.lux on my Windows PC, my eyes hurt. 

I think it definitely makes a difference.]]></description>
