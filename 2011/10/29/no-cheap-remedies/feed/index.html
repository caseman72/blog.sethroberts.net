		<description><![CDATA[You eat breakfast and don&#039;t wake up early? If you stop eating breakfast (or delay it by three hours) you might wake up more rested. (The effect of eating breakfast takes about a week to go away.) Again, research about anticipatory activity -- the diversity of animals in which it&#039;s been observed -- implies that what I found is true for everyone. There are thousands of examples where something like this (observed in a wide range of animals and a few humans) has turned out to be true for all humans. I don&#039;t know of a single exception. Another way to think about it is to consider the correlation between the DNA of one human and the DNA of another human. Very very high.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think the guiding principle you mention need be absolute. As an advocate of barefoot (less to buy) running, I&#039;m trying to identify groups with a financial incentive in prevention - they do exist. 

Those who sell drugs and devices, or provide healthcare, generally don&#039;t benefit from providing prevention. Long-term insurers, on the other hand, do.  

Kaiser has many &quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; clients, so benefits from cost-effective prevention. I&#039;m in contact with them. The US military does as well - they don&#039;t want their soldiers to get injured on duty, and they provide lifetime health care, so are on the hook to pay for long-term health issues. I&#039;m meeting them as well.

Who else?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Can &#039;breakfast is bad&#039; possibly be right for everyone?&quot; Yes. Assuming that everyone has 24-hour access to food. The phenomenon I uncovered (anticipatory awakening) is merely an example in humans of something that has been found in a wide range of other mammals -- for example, rats. Rats become more active at the time of day food is available. The phenomenon occurs with protein, fat, and carbohydrate sources of calories. If you eat a breakfast with no calories, you can avoid the problem I uncovered. I drink calorie-free tea early in the morning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very good post, Seth!  I wrote a guest post for KevinMD on the problems with the pharmceutical industry.  I did a lot of research and wrote a serious piece which outlined the abuses of the industry and ways to make it better.  Kevin declined to publish it without giving any reason.  I think that the medical industry as a whole does not want to make any changes that will cause anyone to earn less money.  They certainly do not want a healthy population!]]></description>
