		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth.  

Great post!  This is only one of the many ways the health care industry fails us.  And one I hadn&#039;t considered.  The band-aid approach (throw a pill at it) rather than address the underlying cause of an issue is the norm. As a nurse, I see this all to often and find it very frustrating.  Glad to see a post on the subject.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You know, when I used to train in Judo and Karate, I remember having trouble running, so I never jogged (using jogging shoes) but when they made us run some laps as part of the workouts (barefoot), I never had trouble.  I never really thought about it then.

Jogging shoes = foot problems.  No shoes, no problems.

On the other hand, I do have shoes I walk in that give me no trouble at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Virgil, you write: &quot;The shoe manufacturers should be the target.&quot; Hmm. They are not going to voluntarily stop making shoes. Therefore they cannot take seriously the idea that barefoot running is best. 

In contrast, medical school professors (and by extension doctors ,who repeat what med school professors say) can take seriously that idea. Nothing stops them from learning how to prevent, not just how to cure. The medical system did a bad job here because it focused on the symptoms and ignored the cause of the symptoms.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would not blame the medical system for the above problems, but the shoe manufacturers. Given that plantar fasciitis and ITBS are pretty nasty problems which, left untreated will result in excruciating pain and inability to walk, I&#039;d say the medical system here did a pretty good job - it diagnosed and treated the patient. If the patient then continued with the damaging behavior (running in regular shoes), that&#039;s not the medical establishment&#039;s fault.  Expecting the medical establishment to be fully aware of problems with running shoes, when hundreds of millions of people use them every day without issue, is also unreasonable.   I know your blog is usually biased (sometimes correctly) against the medical-industrial-complex, but in this case I think the rage is mis-directed.  The shoe manufacturers should be the target.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are inexpensive biofeedback  insoles  like Barefoot Science that will help promote a strengthening of the foot. It is a wierd arrangement. The parent company encourages people to be barefoot and strengthenn their feet the most natural way possible, but if you need to wear shoes,  for running or anything, then you use their insoles to combat the negative atrophying effects of the shoe. The stronger  healthier foot makes the transisition to be being barefoot faster and safer, and yes, it also would show huge cost reduction benefits to the helath care system]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sadly, individual hospital chains within the US healthcare system (possibly excepting Kaiser) appear to have no incentive to improve their patients&#039; health or reduce injuries - quite the opposite. To podiatrists, just the mention of barefoot running is a red flag waving in front of their face, as they see all business disappearing.

		<description><![CDATA[Tuck, it doesn&#039;t shake my faith too much, as A: I already know that kind of thing happens and B: there&#039;s a fairly good explanation.

We have forgotten, but before the industrial revolution people feared nature because it had much more power in their lives than they did. And didn&#039;t particularly care to use that power for good, obviously. 

Thick soles were probably psychologically motivated by wanting to reject this dangerous &#039;nature&#039; stuff. To us it&#039;s obvious that we can&#039;t design a better shoe-ground interface than nature did. (At least, not for a while yet.) To them it was just as obvious, but they were too invested to accept it. In 1912, the culture hadn&#039;t yet forgotten its fear and hatred of nature. Even though nature had already been conquered, these feelings take a while to subside in cultures, just like feelings take a while to subside in individuals. 

The whole &#039;nature is good&#039; thing is really new and was, as far as I&#039;m aware, spurred by the whole radioactive consumer goods debacle. Before that, the emotional affect of &#039;all-natural&#039; was held by the words &#039;artificial&#039; and &#039;synthetic,&#039; which you can check by looking at period advertisements. Subsequent events with pesticides etc. have played into confirmation bias.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I switched to barefoot 2 years ago after I heard it could cure my various running injuries.

Well, within a month they were all gone and haven&#039;t come back. And, as a sprinter, going 2 years without an injury is unheard of.

Geek that I am, I started making high-tech huaraches (so I could be almost barefoot all the time, and still get into restaurants ;-) ). That turned into www.invisibleshoe.com and I&#039;m thrilled to say we&#039;ve now helped over 10,000 people make the transition.

I&#039;m also happy to report that last year I decided to see how long I could make it into the Colorado winter before I wanted to put on shoes.... next thing I knew, it was Spring! ;-)]]></description>
