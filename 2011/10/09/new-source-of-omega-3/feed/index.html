		<description><![CDATA[Based on this suggestion, I ordered camelina oil from the good farmers in Saskatchewan and began taking it using the same dose (3T/day) that I had been taking of flaxseed oil for relief of psoriasis and lichen planus.  Unfortunately, the slow but sure improvement I had been experiencing over the past year with flaxseed oil stopped immediately and after a week my skin and mouth began to deteriorate.  After using about 1/4 of a bottle of the new oil I went back to flaxseed and am delighted to report that I am now having good results with it.  Since both of my conditions wax and wane without any reason identified by medical science I cannot state that it was simply the flaxseed oil that has led to this success.  Based on my experience, however, I intend to continue taking the oil regularly and I recommend that others with either psoraisis or lichen planus try it.  For me, two tablespoons a day were not enough, I needed three tablespoons of the oil to see a change.  I don&#039;t think it advisable to take capsules, you&#039;d need to take too many of them to equal 3T of oil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Flaxseed and flaxseed meal doesn’t mix well with the kind of foods I like eating and can eat.&quot;

You can just add some water to ground flaxseed, which makes it into something like oatmeal. Then, you can add whatever you want to that for flavouring (applesauce, cinnamon, blueberry sauce, and so on).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I finally looked up the Omega-III content for both. Flaxseed seems to be nearly 1.5 as dense as ALA as chia; I&#039;m impressed.

I&#039;ll still take chia, though, even considering how much it costs (five times as much) because I like taking chia. Taking flaxseed is much less convenient for my habits. Flaxseed and flaxseed meal doesn&#039;t mix well with the kind of foods I like eating and can eat. I&#039;d love to mix it with yogurt like Seth does but food allergies stop me. Despite my present very large fermented food intake, cow&#039;s milk derivatives, including homemade yogurt and kefir, still trigger my food allergies and cause me to get sick a few days later (ear infections, cold, flu, etc.) It&#039;s amusing that consuming milk products is pretty much the *only* thing that can get me sick these days, thanks to homemade kimchi and kombucha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I soak and rinse flax seeds for a couple of days, then grind them up, then mix in some flour, then cook them into pancakes.  It is a lot of work, but I think I get a better result - my blood pressure has dropped, and I run without my knees complaining.]]></description>

What are your thoughts on the estrogen content of flax?

I remember reading that flax is about three times higher in estrogen than soy. This is the main reason I have been supplementing with fish oil while consuming mostly ruminant meat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I wonder whether a burr grinder would work with flaxseed. I have a Capresso Infinity which I use for coffee. The advantage would be you could just leave a bunch of seed in the hopper, and calibrate the timer so that you could dial the amount you want without having to measure out anything.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why do I prefer vegetable sources? Because fish oil gave me a headache. I have nothing against other sources but the vegetable sources have had clear benefits: better balance, better gums, better arithmetic speed, etc. So if those &quot;issues&quot; are about low convertability, the statements are wrong in my case. Plenty of short chain omega-3 is converted to long-chain omega-3.

By getting a large amount of omega-3 from flax seeds I can more easily vary the dosage and thereby find out the best dose. I have never -- before or after I started consuming lots of flaxseed oil or flax seed -- found myself craving omega-3. I don&#039;t know what that feels like.]]></description>
