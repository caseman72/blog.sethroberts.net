		<description><![CDATA[After I began reading Seth&#039;s blog a couple of years ago, I started experimenting with fermented foods.  It&#039;s fun.  I make kombucha on a regular basis, and I usually let it undergo a second fermentation.  I add a couple of ounces of fruit juice to a 16-ounce glass bottle, top it off with kombucha, and then close the lid tightly.  Within a couple of days, the kombucha is nicely carbonated.  You have to be careful, though, to use juice without any preservatives -- otherwise, it doesn&#039;t work.

I&#039;ve also made lacto-fermented salsa and fermented jalapeño slices.  I tried making kim chee once, but it had a pretty nasty flavor to it, so I threw it away.

Anyway, making your own fermented food is fun, and it tastes good (usually).]]></description>
