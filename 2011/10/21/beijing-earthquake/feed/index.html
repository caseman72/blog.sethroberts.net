		<description><![CDATA[Long ago I knew a Postdoctoral Fellow, one of the small number who had then been let out of Red China to work/study in the West.  Once he&#039;d got the hang of things he confided to me that he&#039;d learned the expression &quot;civic responsibility&quot; as a good summary of what no Chinese took seriously: they cared only for self and family.  I was astonished at his courage, or foolhardiness, in saying as much to a near-stranger.

(We also had an interesting conversation in the wake of his first visit to the British Museum.  &quot;Were the civilisations of Egypt and Mesopotamia as old as the museum said?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;Then I have been lied to.&quot;)]]></description>
