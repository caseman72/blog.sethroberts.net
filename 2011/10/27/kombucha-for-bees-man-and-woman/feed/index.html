		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE kombucha.  However, I also love good data and good science.  The article Kombucha:
The Manchurian Mushroom
My Adventures with &quot;The Blob&quot;

by Paul Stamets
Updated July 1995
Originally published in Mushroom, The Journal, Winter 1994–95

Available at http://www.fungi.com/info/articles/blob.html

Is amazing reading for anyone who&#039;d like to understand the contents and challenges with repeatable kombucha.  Don&#039;t get me wrong, I drink kombucha on a regular basis, but I&#039;ve become much more aware of the underlying issues with it after reading this article.  

P.S.  I found this through the amazing Wild Fermentation site (http://www.wildfermentation.com/index.php), another fan of live foods!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maria, no doubt kombucha increases digestion of many nutrients. If one of those nutrients is omega-3, that would reduce joint pain. But I suspect kombucha reduces joint pain for the same reason bee stings (and perhaps acupuncture) are effective: introducing antigens reduces inflammation. The better hair, on the other hand, I&#039;d guess is due to better digestion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been drinking kombucha daily for about two years.  I haven&#039;t noticed any health improvements -- but then again, I was pretty healthy to begin with.

My wife also drinks it daily, or almost-daily.  She has a history of chronic indigestion, bloating, and related digestive problems.  She&#039;s tried all sorts of drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter, without any success.  Probiotics have not helped, either.  Drinking kombucha is moderately helpful to her.  The digestive problems continue but in abated form.  When she misses drinking kombucha for a day or two, she notices a distinct worsening of her symptoms.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The two things I can safely eat are starches (potatoes and rice) and lean meat. Fat is definitely out, even small amounts of it. So I think kombucha is impossible for me, even if it didn&#039;t trigger lactose intolerance.

What can I ferment? How do I do it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is a hypothesis. The hair texture probably depends on the same mechanisms that cause reduction in joint pain. Short-term hair changes depend on the excretions from the scalp. Conditioners attempt to substitute for the healthy scalp oils, but of course it&#039;s not as natural-looking as what the body can produce. So, when the body works better with its fats, that includes the substances that &quot;oil&quot; joints and substances that &quot;oil&quot; the hair.]]></description>
