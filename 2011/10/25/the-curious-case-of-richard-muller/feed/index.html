		<description><![CDATA[Moving the goal posts I see. The conversation is not about the ramifications of global warming but about about temperature reconstructions from recording stations of which there have now been 4 (5 with the American focused Surface Station study by Watts). Because they all closely align means that there is an almost statistical impossibility that any one of them could have been fudged, pre-fudged or double fudged. This logically implies that the data from NOAA, NASA, HadCRU and BEST was collected in a professional and rigorous manner.

If you can&#039;t you admit that then we have nothing to talk about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course I have an effing &quot;agenda&quot;.  I think the climate scientists are largely a bunch of duds who made silly, hubristic claims in the early days and since then that many of them have been dishonest as a way of defending their positions.  But that&#039;s not the point here.  This is the one bit of the whole field that the Global Warming hysterics and the sceptics needn&#039;t disagree on, namely that it has (probably) got warmer.  My complaint is specific: they still haven&#039;t been able to produce a convincing curve of mean surface temperature accompanied by a decent stab at its uncertainty.  What the hell&#039;s the point speculating about the cause of the warming, or predicting its future course, if you can&#039;t even provide a trustworthy account of its history? It&#039;s an extraordinary failure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t be disingenuous and pretend you want a proper discussion. You have just been presented with a 5th temperature reconstruction that so closely matches the other 4 that it would be next to impossible for any of them to have been &quot;fudged&quot;, &quot;pre-fudged&quot;  or &quot;un-fudged&quot; -- statistically speaking of course. Therefore, you must either trust the data and how it was collected or you don&#039;t trust statistics. Which is it?

You have not even a hint of a shred of a whiff of impropriety by any scientist involved with temperature stations and yet you choose to continue the charade. 

You, my dearieme, have an agenda and honesty doesn&#039;t enter in to it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s Matt Briggs on the uncertainty.
 
&quot;BEST’s estimates of uncertainty are too narrow. That is, BEST is too sure of themselves. By how much they are uncertain, there is disagreement. There is strong evidence that their certainty is off by at least a factor of two.
That is, BEST should at least double its uncertainty, which means we should have even less confidence in what happened in the past. Which means we are still unsure—we may always be unsure—exactly what the temperature was prior to about 1940. We may be sure what it was at a few individual land stations, but we will probably remain unsure what the temperature was averaged over all land surfaces. This is likely a case of scientific tough luck. If only our ancestors had thought to measure temperature most assiduously, we wouldn’t be in this boat.&quot;

For Doug Keenan&#039;s view, there&#039;s this http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5700.htm

As for our other differences, I suppose I&#039;ll just have to wait until the papers are published and read them and the criticisms that will presumably appear.  I&#039;ll be particularly interested in Steve McIntyre&#039;s, who obviously has no animus towards Muller but is properly sceptical of any data analysis put before him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[derieme, the whole point of the BEST study was to revisit the RAW data with complete openness and to make this data available to any and everyone who wishes to crunch the numbers themselves. BEST used new methodology, a world-class team of climate scientists and statisticians (including the famed skeptic Judith Curry) and looked specifically into areas (such as UHI) that other skeptics deemed to be ignored by NASA, NOAA and HadCRU. BEST also increased the sampling by 5 fold (39,000+ stations) and compiled 1.2 billion  (with a &#039;B&#039;) data points. 

Statistically speaking, getting 4 independent temperature reconstructions (5, if you want to count Anthony Watts&#039; Surface station study) to be so closely aligned based on false data would be like flipping a coin and getting &quot;heads&quot; five hundred times in a row. Your use of the terms &quot;pre-fudged&quot; and &quot;un-fudged&quot; is nothing more than gobbledygook.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I understand it (and I&#039;m open to correction) Muller used the usual land surface data, which is undoubtedly pre-fudged, or as the climate scientists like to put it, &quot;adjusted&quot;.  (Surely no-one denies that it&#039;s been &quot;adjusted&quot; - the adjusters boast of their efforts.)  So I am still left in the preposterous situation that I find it entirely plausible that the world has warmed since, for example, my parents&#039; childhoods in the 1920s, but I cannot gauge how much it has warmed because no-one has managed to publish a graph that uses un-fudged data, and includes a decent estimate of the uncertainties in the results.  This is, I have to say, scandalous.  Millions upon millions have been spent, and still there&#039;s nothing competent and trustworthy.  Why the climate scientists behave like such berks I don&#039;t know - do they believe that the warming is so small and uncertain that they need to lie about it?  Is doing a decent statistical analysis beyond their intellectual level?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find it entirely plausible that there&#039;s been global warming - like many people, I expect, I compare my experiences with my parents&#039; in my part of the world: the notion of warming is consistent with that comparison. But ever since I first looked into Global Warming I&#039;ve been baffled by the incompetence and, in my view, dishonesty displayed in even so apparently simple a task at trying to calculate a graph of mean land surface temperature versus time, with a decent stab at representing the degree of uncertainty involved.  I can&#039;t say whether Muller has achieved this either - for a start, I suspect him of having used surface &quot;measurements&quot; that are not measurements at all, having been pre-fudged.  Anyway, I&#039;ll have to wait for his stuff to be published and then, if I can summon the effort, have a look at it.  I have already seen a couple of criticisms that argue that he hasn&#039;t remotely achieved what I referred to as &quot;a decent stab at representing the degree of uncertainty involved&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The top hit for a Google search for: Fox News &quot;global warming&quot;

includes this quote:  &quot;The planet isn&#039;t heating up, in other words.&quot;

Based on my reading of the newspapers, I&#039;d say that most (US Republican-voting) skeptics of global warming do deny the existence of global warming or any climate change. And yes, they also deny that we have anything to do with it. Because when &quot;1000 year weather catastrophes&quot; roll around year after year, they can just blame gay people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Request: Can you write about your position on ocean acidification (or attach a link in the comments if you&#039;ve already done so and I missed it)?

I respect your opinion quite a lot, so I&#039;ve been paying attention to what you write about Global Warming, and am trying to keep an open-mind on it. However, even if you were entirely correct that carbon pollution has not led to an increase in temperature, that would not affect my opinion that we need to take drastic measures to reduce our carbon pollution. I feel that ocean acidification is the knock-down argument that carbon pollution is having devastating effects. Carbonic acid dissolves calcium carbonate, which is the substance of which shell-life and corals are comprised. Carbonic acid levels are steadily rising, and if they continue to do so shells will grow weak and brittle, which in turn will create an ecological catastrophe. 

Perhaps the reason we&#039;re not seeing as much of a temperature increase as expected is because the carbon is being removed from the atmosphere and absorbed into the ocean. But that doesn&#039;t make carbon pollution any less of a problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you know and I know that there is a sizable percentage of skeptics who believe that the whole climate change issue is a scam encouraged and even manipulated by climate scientists out for money or control or both. It has been a distracting influence on the entire debate. Now, hopefully, that nonsense can be put in the dustbin and we can move on to more germane and important matters. Agreed?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Drewski, I am not saying Muller&#039;s work is unimportant. I am saying: why does he so badly misrepresent the position of skeptics? 

As for &quot;world-wide conspiracy&quot; I believe a substantial number of climate scientists (all over the world) have vastly overstated how certain we can be that humans have caused significant global warming. In this sense they have not been rigorous. I would not use the word &lt;em&gt;conspiracy &lt;/em&gt; here but whatever word is used, Muller&#039;s new data does not change my opinion about that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What Muller has conclusively shown is that climate scientists ARE rigorous in their work and that there is no &quot;fudging&quot;. He has put to bed -- once and for all -- the ridiculous notion of a world-wide conspiracy amongst climate scientists. That is one very important hurdle now crossed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes a small part of the overall skeptic &quot;movement&quot; is about the temperature record. I think it is obvious there has been plenty of warming since the Little Ice Age so I consider that a minor point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your historic perspective may be a little thin on the question of whether any skeptics deny that any increase in temperature is occurring. I&#039;ve seen a great many such claims. Here&#039;s one high profile version:

August 27, 2010 (D’Aleo &amp; Watts): SUMMARY FOR POLICY MAKERS
1. Instrumental temperature data for the pre-satellite era (1850-1980) have been so widely, systematically, and uni-directionally tampered with that it cannot be credibly asserted there has been any significant “global warming” in the 20th century.
http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/originals/policy_driven_deception.html

As Lemniscale points out, the term &quot;global warming&quot; is ambiguous here too, but a read of the paper leaves no doubt that the authors were claiming exaggeration of the long term instrumental temperature trend.]]></description>
