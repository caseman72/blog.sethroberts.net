		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t go as far as Jan Madsen but finance is an industry with lots and lots of government regulations.  Perhaps in his heart of hearts Greenspan opposed these.  However, he made almost no effort to &quot;deregulate&quot; any aspect of the industry when he was Federal Reserve chairman--no speeches, no lobbying Congress, no Fed &quot;studies.&quot;

He did oppose most new regulation but that is a different thing.  He may have felt that finance was about as good an example of &quot;mixed economy&quot; &quot;regulated markets&quot; as you were likely to get.

Of course, he was wrong.  But we still don&#039;t know exactly what changes will make things better how.  Dodd-Frank, on balance, is probably doing more harm than good (I count as harm the increased business for lawyers and lobbyist; many in Congress may disagree).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, you were quite clear. Yes, he was against government regulation of financial markets - in the 1960s and 70s. As chairman of the Fed, however, he was by definition, in body, mind, soul, to the bone, in every way imaginable, very much FOR government intervention of financial markets. His reputation as a free marketeer is simply wrong, wrong, wrong as well as being and insult to both pro and anti interventionists. 
But I doubt we&#039;ll agree on that... Instead, let me finish by saying I really enjoy your work. Thanx!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[dearime, that the Nobel Prize is so often given for useless work, contrary to Nobel&#039;s instructions, to me shows the power of the forces (especially the desire to project status) that Veblen wrote about in Theory of the Leisure Class. You project status by being useless. Powerful people can afford to be. When a rich person &quot;wastes&quot; their money I have no objection. When a scientist or whole discipline wastes their power to improve human life, it is a tragedy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, you ask &quot;Is there a difference between common sense and confirmation bias?&quot; Yes. Common sense is a set of beliefs that we have great faith in and that are widely shared. Confirmation bias is a scientific strategy that tends to set up tests so that they confirm the beliefs we start with. I think you&#039;re right that there&#039;s a connection: confirmation bias leads us to be overconfident about our common sense. (Whether that is why we are overconfident in our common sense I don&#039;t know but it is plausible.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Alex. To me, that example supports my point. Crabbe believed that he was likely to have controlled all the important factors but he was wrong. His common sense was wrong. He tested it, which is good. I don&#039;t agree with the author&#039;s conclusion here (&quot;a lot of extraordinary scientific data are nothing but noise&quot;). I would say the Crabbe data suggests that a lot of data are less generalizable than we might think. But that data is an improvement on common sense -- which is to say it is not &quot;noise&quot;. In essence my conclusion is exactly the opposite of the author&#039;s  (the author is Jonah Lehrer). The Crabbe example shows how important all data is and how we should never ignore it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[George, I&#039;m not &quot;judging Sargent&#039;s work&quot; I&#039;m commenting on a graduation speech. As for Sargent&#039;s serious work, here is one paper:

http://www.mpls.frb.org/research/QR/QR531.pdf

Supposedly important. It was linked to in a Washington Post article about why Sargent won the Nobel Prize. Perhaps this paper illustrates what you mean by &quot;showing&quot; that common sense is wrong. Please note the absence of data. In particular, the absence of data and comparison with prediction. To me this instance of Sargent&#039;s work &quot;shows&quot; nothing except theoretical overconfidence. What if, ten years from now, someone tests predictions from Sargent&#039;s theory and it turns out that those predictions are wrong? Then you might be less sure than you are now about what Sargent has &quot;shown&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know Seth blogged about this already, but I&#039;m reminded of &quot;The Truth Wears Off&quot;, an article that appeared in the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; last December.  Here&#039;s an excerpt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the late nineteen-nineties, John Crabbe, a neuroscientist at the Oregon Health and Science University, conducted an experiment that showed how unknowable chance events can skew tests of replicability. He performed a series of experiments on mouse behavior in three different science labs: in Albany, New York; Edmonton, Alberta; and Portland, Oregon.  Before he conducted the experiments, he tried to standardize every variable he could think of. The same strains of mice were used in each lab, shipped on the same day from the same supplier. The animals were raised in the same kind of enclosure, with the same brand of sawdust bedding. They had been exposed to the same amount of incandescent light, were living with the same number of littermates, and were fed the exact same type of chow pellets. When the mice were handled, it was with the same kind of surgical glove, and when they were tested it was on the same equipment, at the same time in the morning.

The premise of this test of replicability, of course, is that each of the labs should have generated the same pattern of results. “If any set of experiments should have passed the test, it should have been ours,” Crabbe says. “But that’s not the way it turned out.”  In one experiment, Crabbe injected a particular strain of mouse with cocaine. In Portland the mice given the drug moved, on average, six hundred centimetres more than they normally did; in Albany they moved seven hundred and one additional centimetres.  But in the Edmonton lab they moved more than five thousand additional centimetres. Similar deviations were observed in a test of anxiety. Furthermore, these inconsistencies didn’t follow any detectable pattern. In Portland one strain of mouse proved most anxious, while in Albany another strain won that distinction.

The disturbing implication of the Crabbe study is that a lot of extraordinary scientific data are nothing but noise. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Wow.  You learned all you needed to know in order to judge an entire discipline from a &lt;i&gt;graduation speech&lt;/i&gt;?!  

If you had bothered to read Sargent&#039;s work before judging it you would have seen that he won the Nobel for research showing that what people used to think was common sense (particular fiscal and monetary policy) is actually wrong.  

Your post (cf. para 3) rests on the unstated assumption that common sense = naive expectations.   Sargent&#039;s work (on &quot;rational expectations&quot;), on the other hand, specifically argues that this assumption isn&#039;t true, so it seems sort of silly to criticize him for making it.]]></description>
