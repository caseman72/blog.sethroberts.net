		<description><![CDATA[There are two reasons dietary healing only works for &quot;some&quot;

One is that changing your diet - especially when it means cutting out food oyu love - is difficult.  It&#039;s easy to cheat and results are rarely instant so it becomes easy to fall back into bad habits, and out of guilt use a white lie or two to justify your habit.

The other is that not all people attempting dietary changes are getting good advice, or the right advice.  I was treated for ulcers with pills and told to stay away from nightshades temporarily....turns out I had Celiac Disease which was causing the ulcers.  Pills and that particular diet were a temporary fix destined to fail. 

Until there are controled studies (and better diagnosis) diets will always only work for a small sampling of patients.  

In the survey I set-up (http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/XNQKKDF - still a small sampling) 85% had to self-diagnose after visting 1-6 doctors to figure out what was going on. And they also had to bring up the idea of dietary changes as a method for healing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Logical blindness against SCD

In http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_Carbohydrate_Diet#Criticism
A doctor says:
in my experience, for every patient I see who tried the diet and it worked, there are three to four others who tried it and it didn&#039;t work&quot;

He practically says that it works for *some* people. Yet, if it does not work for all, it does not count. (rationaly, if it heals 20% of suferrers it is a wonderful gamble to try!)

Which is again the cognitive illusion that personal solutions are uninteresting and he needs a solution that works for all. 

I see it as stemming from wanting a &quot;good colution&quot; rather than a practical solution. Looking for a story.
A diet that works for some is not a &quot;solution&quot; just a patch.

As usual, normal people want to be healthy, and care zilch on whether it helps *everyone*

I couldn&#039;t sleep well and was in pain most of the time.  Eating became misery.  At first I tried the acid blockers the doctors recommended, but that stopped working over time.  Finally I found out about Dr. Jonathon Wright MD and his suggestion that acid reflux is actually caused by two little digestive acid.  I started taking Hydrocholoric Acid per his suggestion with every meal.  In addition to his suggestion, I took mass quantities of probiotics and also took Mastic Gum.

		<description><![CDATA[After reading this (and the boing boing article) and talking to more and more people with digestive and GI related illnesses - I started a little survey (informal) to see what the responses of accurate doctor dignosis and support is with regards to diet changes.  

Not sure how I&#039;ll publish the results yet, but I am surprised at how many people without these health issues think self-diagnosis is wrong or that seeing a few doctors before someone figures it out is an exception rather than the rule.  Would love for this to spread to get a more accurate idea of what people&#039;s experiences really are.

BTW, i am now browsing the SCD food list, and see that bananas are allowed only when ripe with black points. I know from my stomach experience, that i can eat bananas only when fully ripe. So she was clearly on something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Elisa- while true that double-blind studies are not possible, here&#039;s one for you: to deny that diets work in Crohn&#039;s disease would be to deny tens- probably hundreds- of controlled studies done on enteral nutrition (EN) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Very few medical professionals experienced with IBD would challenge that EN and TPN are effective at inducing and maintaining remission; most studies put the efficacy of EN and TPN at somewhere around 60-70%. See Oppenheimer&#039;s excellent (and well-referenced) &quot;Beat Crohn&#039;s!&quot; for more information on the subject.

So- if &quot;food in a can&quot; (EN) or a needle-fed diet (TPN) control IBD, what is the mechanism? Note (from Oppenheimer&#039;s book) that they are roughly equivalent in terms of efficacy, so it is not a matter of &quot;bowel rest&quot; (as provided by TPN).

Instead, close examination of the ingredients of many brands- including Modulen IBD by Nestle- shows they are all depleted in starch and complex carbohydrates. This is extremely important: it&#039;s the starch and the polymeric carbs (probably even disaccharides, including sucrose and lactose) that cause the problems. Monosaccharides are absorbed very &quot;high&quot; in the digestive tract- before they get to the part of the intestines in which the bacterial/yeast dysbiosis is occurring.

The SCD/Gottschall/BTVC is simply a fork-and-plate version of EN and TPN.

It is also important to note that all enteral diets are devoid of wheat, barley, rye, and oats; most have some small amount of cornstarch or rice starch as a texturizing agent.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elisa- while true that double-blind studies are not possible, here&#8217;s one for you: to deny that diets work in Crohn&#8217;s disease would be to deny tens- probably hundreds- of controlled studies done on enteral nutrition (EN) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Very few medical professionals experienced with IBD would challenge that EN and TPN are effective at inducing and maintaining remission; most studies put the efficacy of EN and TPN at somewhere around 60-70%. See Oppenheimer&#8217;s excellent (and well-referenced) &#8220;Beat Crohn&#8217;s!&#8221; for more information on the subject.</p>
<p>So- if &#8220;food in a can&#8221; (EN) or a needle-fed diet (TPN) control IBD, what is the mechanism? Note (from Oppenheimer&#8217;s book) that they are roughly equivalent in terms of efficacy, so it is not a matter of &#8220;bowel rest&#8221; (as provided by TPN).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Scads of commenters saying that we can&#039;t trust dietary treatments until we do double-blind studies. Uh, guys? You can&#039;t do a double-blind study with FOOD! Double-blind studies work for drug trials because placebos and real pills look alike. A carb-free diet doesn&#039;t look like a carby one.

Seriously, do these people not know what &quot;double-blind&quot; means?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth,

I have had many problems since I was a child. Asthma, ezcema, allergies, etc. In high school I fractured my hip but wasn&#039;t able to recover to normal. I wasn&#039;t diagnosed with anything in particular because no one was really able to know what happened, why it happened, and what the problem was other than I had back problems. They say the hip/back was inflammed, gave me pain pills, and told me to come back if anything got worse (some sort of arthritis/back stiffening). If that would have happened I probably would of had to do surgery. My whole time I had been taking various medicines and things for all my ailments. I also tried a lot of alternative methods. Nothing really &#039;worked&#039; and satisfied me. However, this past year and summer I learned about a method of self-healing in China and it really helped me.

Its called Yixingtianxia. The two main methods are called la-jin and pai-da. They have a pretty bad English website at http://www.yixingtianxia.com/newpage/en/index.html. Its catching on pretty fast in China, so I&#039;m not sure if you have heard of it. I was probably one of the few (and youngest) people to go there from the US to do a workshop there.

I&#039;ve written pretty extensively on the subject on a blog I made to talk about my experiences with disease/alternative medicine. I plan to continue to update my status and my thoughts there at eltacodelmente.wordpress.com. I would extremely glad to talk to you about my experience and happy to talk with you about the subject. I can only say that my life has truly been changed through my diseases. I feel like a totally different person not relying on the medicine to &#039;treat&#039; my pain. Because I&#039;ve been so greatly helped it only seems right to try and tell other people about what I&#039;ve been through and what I&#039;ve experienced. Its all pretty new to me but I feel eager to learn. I guess this passion comes from the personal connection to my life.

I just stumbled upon your article yesterday and I feel it really in alignment with what I&#039;ve been thinking about lately. Thanks a lot!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a biochemist; I have Crohn&#039;s disease. I started the SCD the day I was diagnosed, now almost 4 years ago. The Boingboing discussion is very discouraging.

Within 2 weeks, my diarrhea had stopped. Within 2 months, the bleeding had stopped. Within 3 months, I was up 13 pounds, after losing 1 pound/week for almost 9 months. Within 6 months, I was back to arduous caving trips. Within a year, my blood values were all within norms, except for folate. (That pesky folate.)

About that time, I converted to a generally low-carb, grain-free diet, a combination of what Lutz (Life Without Bread) and Gottschall (Breaking the Vicious Cycle) had to say. And I felt even better.

Today, I&#039;m fine; I suffer not at all, unless I stray from the diet, in which case I suffer severe pain and discomfort.

It must be noted my diagnosis is absolute; the doctor is beyond reproach, and in a phone conversation with the attending pathologist, it&#039;s clearly Crohn&#039;s and the differentials don&#039;t match at all.

Since my diagnosis, I have read &gt;10,000 pages of books and primary literature on the subject- now adding &quot;Colon and Rectal Surgery&quot; (933 pages) for good measure. Also read Crohn&#039;s original books, including his autobiography, the original Crohn, Ginzburg, and Oppenheimer paper, etc. Everything I can read.

Anyway, doing great. Also note Leo Galland studied the SCD, and found it worked very well.

http://www.mdheal.org/crohn%27s.htm

&quot;All 20 patients demonstrated a decrease in symptoms and reduction in medication use. Six patients have entered complete clinical remission, discontinued all medication, and maintained remission for five to 80 months.&quot;

As it is, I think I know what causes Crohn&#039;s; I&#039;m writing a book on the subject, but I don&#039;t have a publisher. It&#039;s a combination of technical literature and &quot;popular&quot; writing, so I don&#039;t expect it to sell well. Most Crohnies don&#039;t seem to want anything more than pills and surgery.

Y&#039;all take care, and if I could offer one tidbit: for those that wish to try dietary control, consider an all-meat diet. Check out the Dirty Carnivore forums.]]></description>
