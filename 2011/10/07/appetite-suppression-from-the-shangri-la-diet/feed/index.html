		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, I really like you blog, podcasts and the concept of this book. I didn&#039;t like the implementation, but tried another variation with similar effects. Eating as much as possible novel foods and spacing repeat foods apart when I didn&#039;t have access to a novel food. Originally I thought I&#039;d run out of novel foods but that hasn&#039;t happened nor do I think it will happen anymore. Same weight management effect but also up regulating sences of smell and taste. My apetite hasnt changed however and remains healthy. Overall I had a good experience with this approach and must say that it&#039;s given more reason to enjoy life. A few draw backs is that it also polarized me giving me more favorites but also dislikes. Some smells now practically send me running]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is salt a flavor or a taste? 

My nephew posed the question in response to your defining the difference between you and Stephan

&quot;I think that if you add salt to white rice that white rice becomes more palatable&quot;

That led me to ask is salt a flavor or a taste. Sugar is a taste and my assumption is that salt would be similar.

You said:
Whereas I say only flavor-calorie associations (which make food taste better) raise the set point. I find that unlikely — why should salting one’s food raise the set point? How much pleasure we derive from salt is determined by how much we are salt-deficient. Which seems to me unrelated to fat storage. Anyway that is related to your criticism but not the same. I would like to understand your criticism better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, after listening to your podcast on Jimmy Moore I have been thinking more about SLD and I have a couple of theories/observations that have been bubbling around for a couple of days - wondering your thoughts.

1. Often, I lose weight when I have a cold.  I had always attributed that to a boosted metabolism, but now I&#039;m considering the change in smell that occurs when I&#039;m congested.

2.  Smokers weigh less than non-smokers, and crave sweets when they quit.  This is perfectly consistent with what you wrote above about calorie-free flavor. 

3.  Often I drink sugar water at work, because it&#039;s convenient when I travel to different offices - sugar is easy to come by at the coffee station.   Am I sabotaged if someone put a big pile of brownies in the kitchen?  Should I avoid drinking the sugar water in the kitchen, or should I wait at least an hour before or after SMELLING the brownies before drinking the sugar water?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ingesting flavor w/ no calories (such as diet soda) can be helpful, I believe if
--you would have otherwise drunk/eaten something fattening (such as regular Coke)
--it reduces a craving for flavor. when I started ingesting lots of calories without flavor (the Shangri-La Diet) I started to crave flavor. So the calories without flavor helped me do SLD.

I hope that answers your question. To put it briefly: Flavor w/o calories by itself does nothing. But it will help you do SLD (calories w/o flavor).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Diet Soda - I believe the prevailing theory is that diet soda tends to increase appetite, resulting in the person eating more calories, gaining more weight over time. 

I&#039;m doing intermittent fasting (not eating during work, until about 6 PM in the evening). I have no problem fasting during the day, but I get by by drinking obscene amounts of diet soda.

I&#039;ve recently read about your Shangri-La diet and started implementing those concepts into what I am already doing. My guess is that diet soda is ultimately bad for weight loss, but it would seem that drinking diet soda without ingesting calories close to the time I drink the soda (during my fast) would support flavor/calorie disassociation.

I&#039;m guessing it doesn&#039;t work as my appetite has not decreased at all, but I would like your take on what the difference is between that and doing calories with no flavor, if any.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth:

Correct me if I&#039;m wrong but I interpreted your statement &quot;He eats about 700 calories/day nose-clipped — that’s his version of the diet&quot; to mean the person ate food nose-clipped, yet got the same results as if he/she had taken oil or sugar water without a nose clip.

Is this correct? Please clarify.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, I guess I have a different experience with the oil. When I take it, my hunger goes away. I simply stop thinking about food. 

And yet, even if I have taken the oil, if I go to a restaurant and start eating something highly rewarding (chips, dessert, etc.) I find it difficult to stop. This isn&#039;t the case with protein. If I eat a couple of eggs, I&#039;m satisfied.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yet I still get hungry, Meegs.  But the food I desire shifts.  One food gets more palatable, another gets less palatable, because oil was consumed hours earlier?  

That makes no sense to me.

I read the comments on WHS and people seem to be tying themselves in knots to make Stephan&#039;s theory work.  But...why?

I hope it&#039;s not because Stephan is supposedly &quot;nicer&quot; than Gary Taubes.  (At this point, I hardly think he is. And who cares? I just want to know what to eat to get healthier.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Seth,

My point is probably more basic than the question you&#039;re asking. But I&#039;m simply thinking that my ingesting oil clearly did nothing to change any quality &lt;i&gt;inherent&lt;/i&gt; in the carbs that I invariably crave on days when I&#039;m not drinking oil.  Yet oil-drinking drives their &lt;i&gt;perceived&lt;/i&gt; &#039;palatability/food reward&#039; to zero.  

The effect is clear and 100% repeatable for me.  On no-oil days I &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; want carby cookies or crackers, with milk, before bed. On oil days I &lt;i&gt;sometimes&lt;/i&gt; want meat (or eggs), with water, before bed...but&lt;i&gt; never&lt;/i&gt; carbs.

(I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s only one &#039;set point&#039; -- perhaps there are different ones for different classes of nutrients?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, that&#039;s an interesting comment: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;(This experience is also why I don’t take Stephan Guyanet’s Unified Theory of Palatability seriously.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Could you explain it? 

The difference between Stephan&#039;s theory and mine, as far as I can tell, is that his theory says that anything that makes food more pleasant raises the set point. Whereas I say only flavor-calorie associations (which make food taste better) raise the set point. I find that unlikely -- why should salting one&#039;s food raise the set point? How much pleasure we derive from salt is determined by how much we are salt-deficient. Which seems to me unrelated to fat storage. Anyway that is related to your criticism but not the same. I would like to understand your criticism better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Another benefit- it’s made it easy to switch to a “paleo-style” diet that limits processed foods, and I don’t crave the old foods. But I don’t think the paleo diet would work for me without the oil.&lt;/i&gt;

This is what I&#039;ve found, as well -- drinking oil suppresses overall hunger, true, but it also shifts the foods I desire.  If I&#039;m not drinking oil, I want a blast of carbs before bed.  On the oil, I may get hungry late at night, but I want a bit of protein instead.

That&#039;s been one of the key benefits of Shangri-La for me -- it makes it possible for me to remain compliant with LCHF/Paleo.

(This experience is also why I don&#039;t take Stephan Guyanet&#039;s Unified Theory of Palatability seriously.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michal, I would recommend you keep up the diet. That&#039;s exactly how I felt for the first month or two- still kinda hungry. But then the effects really kicked in and the hunger was gone. Now I feel in control of what I want to eat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been doing this diet the past few months, and it&#039;s amazing to me. For years I have never been able to lose those pesky last 10-15 pounds I need to lose, and as of today I&#039;ve lost 7 pounds.

It started slow, but after a month or two I noticed the weight steadily start to come off.

Also, I find I can adjust the amount of oil I take to adjust my appetite. If I&#039;m eating too much and getting cravings, I take more oil. If I&#039;m eating too little, I take less.

Another benefit- it&#039;s made it easy to switch to a &quot;paleo-style&quot; diet that limits processed foods, and I don&#039;t crave the old foods. But I don&#039;t think the paleo diet would work for me without the oil.

Seth, I think it&#039;s an amazing discovery, I just wish I had found your book earlier!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve tried this diet and lost a few pounds but not very many.  It was weird in that I sort of felt hungry but I didn&#039;t necessarily want to eat.  
I hear about weight loss all the time, but that only tells a limited part of the story.  What body fat percentage have people gotten down with with SLD?]]></description>
