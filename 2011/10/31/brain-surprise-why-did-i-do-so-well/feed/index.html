		<description><![CDATA[Two cariations on flaxseed and yogurt
1) i noticed that the ground seeds are dry when mixed with yogurt. I usually out them first in a little water, and then add yogurt.

2) if left in water for ten or five minutes, it gets a whole different texture and feels different. May chAnge avilability and digestion


Now, I noticed that long grinding makes the ground very hot. With probably effects.



Ps. When i eat flaxseed and yogurt at night i sleep very. Well. Such a sweet wakeup that I rarely had. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would have thought that this was within the normal variation for this kind of test.  Some factors that maybe you didn&#039;t think of/account for:  hours of sleep the previous night, time the test was taken (in hours after waking, and hour of day), time spent doing analytical things (research, writing, reading) the day before, time spent socializing the day before.  

Also, do you have a link for the software to run this test?  I&#039;d be interested in tracking my own results.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas, the Genomera test is very similar to mine, yes. And, yes, I count only correct answers. About the possibility of bias: 1. Variation in error rates is a problem, yes. But I have found wide variation in error rate to be uncorrelated with average speed. There is no clear speed-accuracy tradeoff. 2. I correct for difficulty. Before averaging across trials, the score on every trial (in msec) is adjusted by the difficulty of that trial. Suppose the trial was 7+3. If 7+3 is on average 50 msec slower than average, the score on a 7+3 trial has 50 msec subtracted before I average over trials. IBecause of this adjustment, it is no help to get the hard questions wrong so that your score will be based only on easy questions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ajb, I have not varied the amount of cream I consume. I drink a little bit of cream during the day. I suppose butter and cream will have the same effect, but I have not tested that idea. At first I would use only one brand of butter but now I am sure that many brands produce the benefit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I use the 20-question quiz (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) from the Brain Tuner Lite iPhone app. The quiz involves pressing either a &quot;right&quot; button or a separate &quot;wrong&quot; button to say whether a given simple math equation is wrong or right. Since the app adds five second penalties for each wrong answer, it would seem to avoid the problem @Thomas describes. 

I perform several tests in succession to measure my cognitive functioning so that I can avoid the problem of an unusually easy batch of questions suggesting improved cognitive function. For example, following the addition of bulletproof coffee to my diet and 20 minutes of dual n-back training to my daily routine, I decreased my speed from an average of just over 600 msec/problem to an average of under 575 msec/problem. Interestingly enough, this increase happened notwithstanding 30 minutes daily of icepacks on the back of my neck and on my trapezis prior to bed (for weight loss purposes as described by Tim Ferriss).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I have a question about your test. I think that the one at Genomera is identical to the one you use, correct?

If so, my understanding is that the test does not count incorrect answers when calculating average speed. So if you answer 8 questions correctly before you answer 32 questions right, you use only the response time for those 32 questions to determine your brain function.

But what if a faster speed sometimes indicates poorer brain functioning? For example, let&#039;s say that you&#039;re getting many &quot;hard&quot; questions (e.g., &quot;13-7&quot;) wrong, so your results are biased towards easy questions (e.g., &quot;8-8&quot;). Even if your brain is functioning poorly, you will be very fast at those easy questions. So because of this sampling bias, your test may actually give backwards results in some cases.

I also use the genomera test, so I&#039;m curious about your thoughts on this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I sometimes suggest to my math students they hold their hands under hot water for a while. This is a folk remedy against headaches, but it also helps you relax (that&#039;s the reason I suggest it - math anxiety) and seems to have an effect on blood pressure. It would be interesting to try it as an intervention.

What is frustrating to me, as an instructional designer, is that changing curriculum often has smaller effects compared to physiological interventions like food, or sitting on an exercise ball rather than a chair. Argh!]]></description>
