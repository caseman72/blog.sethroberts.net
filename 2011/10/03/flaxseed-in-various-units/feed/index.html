		<description><![CDATA[Seth, one question: Why do you weigh your flax seed? I buy and eat Whole Foods organic flax seed (golden is prettier, but I think brown has more oil) every morning and the health benefits are self evident. 

But it only costs 25-30 dollars for a 25 Pound bag, and it takes Months for me to go through a bag. (I put it on top of raw organic rolled oats, and top it with orange juice, like cereal, but without the dairy products.)]]></description>

Thanks, Tom, that agrees with my measurements. There are two main kinds of flax seed: brown and golden. Whole Foods usually has golden, in my experience.]]></description>
