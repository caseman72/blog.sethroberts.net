		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t forget the point is to assess things on their merits, not on their credibility. 

I find this a useful test case to separate out merits from red herrings, by comparing it to biological heresies. They&#039;re similar in that they&#039;re both not what Scientists would expect, but can also be reliably tested on the cheap, for the first-hand observers. (They&#039;re like NP-complete: deriving them is hard but checking the solution is easy.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

When reading the summary I noticed a mention that the device was still hooked up to the grid with the assurance that no electricity was going through the cables. 

Why, oh why, would somebody trying to convince some customer of the validity of their claim allow any type of doubt to remain by leaving a cable hooked up to this machine is beyond me... And a red flag.

Cheers,

Igor]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Endorsing this scam seriously damages your credibility. If there were something useful here, its creator would either avoid talking it up to the press, or would provide details. The only reason for not discussing details would be if he knew that someone would take those details and use them to write up an explanation of why the idea won&#039;t work.

As for what the actual mechanism is, it could be any exothermic chemical reaction. But, in order for it to actually be useful, it would have to use inputs that can be gathered in quantity from nature, without using more energy to mine/refine them than is produced in the reaction. If this isn&#039;t a scam, then it&#039;s almost certainly a confused person who&#039;s failed to grasp this point, and used a chemical input without knowing how much energy it took to gather or produce in the first place.

As for academic credentials, I think it makes sense to look at it from a Bayesian perspective: how likely is it that a piece of research is good, conditional on its author having a relevant degree, an irrelevant degree, no degree, or a fake degree? This depends on the amounts of valid and invalid research produced by each group. Your point that the good-to-bad research ratio isn&#039;t significantly better for people with relevant degrees than for people with an irrelevant degree or no degree is well taken. The existence of good research by people without relevant degrees is explained by people wanting to do research but not wanting to pay the high cost of getting one. But a fake degree is something else entirely, because someone who just wanted to do research wouldn&#039;t bother; they&#039;d rather be uncredentialed. Which makes having a fake degree strong evidence against someone being credible, in a way that lacking a degree isn&#039;t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your blog posted excited me greatly.  Unfortunately, after doing a bit of reading, I am pretty sure Rossi&#039;s device is a scam.  Several reasons, but this Quote from Wiki is a good start:

As Ny Teknik reports, Peter Ekström, lecturer at the Department of Nuclear Physics at Lund University in Sweden, concluded, &quot;I am convinced that the whole story is one big scam, and that it will be revealed in less than one year.&quot;[34][24] He cites the unlikelihood of a chemical reaction being strong enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier, the lack of gamma rays, the lack of explanation for the origin of the extra energy, the lack of the expected radioactivity after fusing a proton with 58Ni, the unexplained occurrence of 11% iron in the spent fuel, the 10% copper in the spent fuel strangely having the same isotopic ratios as natural copper, and the lack of any unstable copper isotope in the spent fuel as if the reactor only produced stable isotopes.[34] He later added in New Energy Times that the steam velocity in a videotaped test appears to be way too low for the reported energy production, and that some liquid water might be exiting the system via the drainage tube.[35]]]></description>
