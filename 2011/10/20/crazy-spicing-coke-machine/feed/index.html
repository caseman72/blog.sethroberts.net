		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand how Coke has &quot;just&quot; come up with this. I mean didn&#039;t everyone do this as a child. They were called Suicides... you mix any and all of the pops available in the fountain. This was in the late 80&#039;s early 90&#039;s and everyone I knew did this. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[James, when I&#039;ve done crazy spicing I used about six or seven spice blends (so that I wasn&#039;t already familiar with them) and randomly put two of them on my food.

Alex, you need to add enough spice so that it gains a &quot;ehh&quot; (what is this?) taste. Hedonically neutral. &quot;Is this food?&quot; you should wonder. &quot;It doesn&#039;t taste like any food I&#039;ve had before.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, do you have a sense of how much (or how little) extra spice you need to add in order to fool your system?  So if I eat a bowl of plain oatmeal every day, is it enough to top it with a sprinkle of random herb/spice from the pantry, or do I really need to spice the hell out of it to get the desired effect?]]></description>
