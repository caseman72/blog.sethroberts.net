		<description><![CDATA[This is very interesting and I may well try it. These are some random points I&#039;d make:

- It might be useful to combine a SAD light above the computer while looking at vblogs, particularly if the people are talking supportively about mood disorders. I even wonder if people who record vblogs could be given instructions in how to make their posts useful for this technique, i.e. looking directly at the camera, filling the frame.

- I&#039;m reminded of psychology research where 2 groups of employers told staff they were changing the temperature (or some other variable) by 1 degree to increase productivity and this resulted in higher productivity whether or not the temperature became higher or lower; i.e. taking any steps whatsoever to produce an outcome may be enough to get the result. 

- This therapy takes a lot of commitment so may encourage strong mindfulness which may be the cause of improvement. I wonder if this level of commitment would produce a result regardless of the goal, i.e. spend an hour every morning on a demanding technique and you will lose weight as you are creating a strong commitment to weight loss.

- As well as using faces other changes have been incorporated: light therapy, early sleeping, early rising, consistent sleep and wake times (?).

I suppose I&#039;m still skeptical, however only a few years ago even light therapy raised eyebrows.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: When I discovered the effect, I found that lots of details mattered (e.g., face distance). If the effect was due simply to making a big commitment, or changing something, these details shouldn&#039;t have mattered.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

I still try to avoid fluorescent lights after dark but sometimes they are unavoidable. I worry much less about them now so long as I am wearing my blue-blocker glasses.]]></description>

Thanks for the info.  I live in the midwest where nightfall happens as early as 5 p.m. in the middle of winter.  My sleep time remains fairly consistent.  Does your suggested 7 p.m. fluorescent light time frame hold true under these circumstances as well?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeff, 

I try to avoid fluorescent lights after the sun goes down. I&#039;m sure their damaging effect gets worse the later you are exposed to them -- I can&#039;t say more than that. Before 7 pm I don&#039;t worry much.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -

Your original research paper mentions the need to avoid fluorescent lights in the evening because they mess with the circadian rhythm.  I assume that&#039;s also the same reason for the recommended consistent sleep schedule of around 10 p.m. - 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. - 7 a.m.  Is there a certain point in the evening when one should avoid fluorescent lights (e.g., 2 hours before bed)?  I&#039;m asking because my job requires me to attend some evening meetings that have fluorescent lights.  IIt might negatively impact my job security if I start wearing blue blocker glasses to these work functions. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth has profiled me on this blog.  I have been on anti-depressants continously over the last 8 years. Most recently I have been taking Cymbalta.  I finally weened myself off it during the summer, after experiencing nasty withdrawals.  Morning faces has been the one major change in my daily routine.  I began in late Spring and have not experienced any depression except for the usual sad stuff we all deal with.  I have had some mania, which tends to hit me in late summer.  I seem to get quicker benefits from morning faces than others, but also feel more down days when I do not stick to the plan.

I do not want to stop what i&#039;m doing, but am sure there will come I time when I go without morning faces for an extended time.  Then I will have a better idea of the benefits I am getting using Seth&#039;s theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using Flickr slideshows for what I call &quot;assisted meditation&quot; ... I started out viewing nature shows, but found that looking at smiling faces was more uplifting. Especially when it&#039;s babies!
