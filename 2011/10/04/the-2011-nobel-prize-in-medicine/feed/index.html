		<description><![CDATA[The difference between Applied Science and Pure Science lies in the motives of those pursuing them.  The motives in Pure Science are pure; they are the purely selfish attempt to advance the interests of the researchers.  Those interests vary: sometimes they may be dominated by the desire to satisfy intellectual curiosity; more often, I suspect, they are dominated by the desire for career advancement.  Given this structure of motivations, it follows that all Applied Science research institutions are at permanent risk of being taken over by Pure Science.  Put simply, someone whose motives are mixed, including the desire to do some good for society, must expect to lose in competition against someone whose motives are entirely selfish.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, thanks for these observations which, unfortunately, appear to be quite accurate.  

Sad to say that, based on all I have learned and personally experienced in the last decade or so, I have to suspect that most of what passes for &quot;high-prestige academic research&quot; in the medical / health arena is sponsored (i.e. largely paid for) by pharmaceutical companies and other commercial interests.  

So I suppose no one should be surprised that, unless and until the research is being done by individuals whose independence has not been compromised, a true benefit to mankind is much less likely.  Whatever happened to integrity in academia and government?]]></description>
