		<description><![CDATA[When people say they don&#039;t like beer, I always assume it&#039;s the bitterness from the hops that is bothering them. Good American craft beer is usually incredibly hoppy unless they are imitating a European style and using noble hops. And on the other side you have cheap American beer that is bland because it is brewed with a huge proportion of rice and not so great.

But I think non-beer drinkers might have the best luck trying a Belgian or English ale that tends towards being malty and spicy or nutty and hides the bitterness and alcohol well. Leffe Blond and Fuller&#039;s London Pride are two that might be worth a shot and aren&#039;t hard to find.

I worry about drinking beer a lot thought, because the hops really are strongly estrogenic: http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/84/6/2249.abstract

My new interest is to track down some of these traditional Scottish-style ales being brewed by Williams Bros, where in lieu of hops they use either heather or Scots pine to flavor the beer. I&#039;ve heard they are very unusual and drinkable!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t much care for the taste of alcohol generally but I like the taste of wine, especially white wine. And can drink some dessert-type liquors. I have no trouble at all drinking wine on social occasions.

When you say &quot;The best beers at a recent beer tasting were far better than the best wines at similar wine tastings.&quot; - My contrary sense is that all beers taste more-or-less bad - it&#039;s a chore to try to finish even *one* bottle of (any variety of) beer. Whereas all wines taste...fine. Some taste pretty good. Wines that are considered especially &quot;good&quot; don&#039;t taste noticeably better than average. In blind taste testings even experts can&#039;t reliably tell the difference between an expensive wine and a cheap one - it&#039;s mostly about expectation - so at a restaurant I tend to go with the cheap one.

Anyway, put me down as a data point: I like wine over beer because beer reliably tastes terrible, though I&#039;ve tried &quot;good&quot; beers. (Beer is fine as a food ingredient, just not as a drink.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; &quot;I’m a beer snob.&quot;

That data point might help explain why I couldn&#039;t personally reproduce your &quot;complex tastes are better&quot; claim.

I recently went to a beer tasting run by a beer snob. There were a couple dozen beers available that were supposed to represent the widest possible variety of types. The problem I had with all of them was that they &quot;tasted like beer&quot;. The only thing called &quot;beer&quot; I find somewhat tasty (rather than wince-worthy) is a Belgian Lambic which tastes *nothing* like beer - it tends to taste like a strawberry wine cooler.

Do you have any suggestions for *learning* to like beer? Or to at least tolerate it?]]></description>
