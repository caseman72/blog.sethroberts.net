		<description><![CDATA[Shane, the data Denise was talking about (Ornish, etc.) is not correlational -- that is, from a survey. It&#039;s from experiments. Moreover, one of Denise&#039;s slides is about &quot;religious vegetarians&quot; -- what we can learn from them. The data in that slide is correlational. I believe that data is helpful. To claim, as Denise did (and I agree), that you can learn something helpful from survey data is roughly the opposite of &quot;correlation is not causation&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the slides is misleading. The exercise comparison was 70% compared to 80%. Proper charting says you always start your bar chart at 0, the person that did the chart started at 50 or so. Otherwise, interesting, not a lot of info, just the last slide that gives a website to look at. Will make me look at it a little closer when I do comparisons in the future.

BTW, bought your book and have been losing weight. It&#039;ll be nice when I get down to my desired &quot;ideal&quot;. Maybe then I&#039;ll be able to run again without getting injured all the time.]]></description>
