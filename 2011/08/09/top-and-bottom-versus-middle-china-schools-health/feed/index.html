		<description><![CDATA[In the first link you said, &quot;I predict that someday someone in the American government (top) will realize that a way to greatly improve health care is to empower patients (bottom) against doctors (middle).&quot;

My father wants to know where insurance companies fit into this.  Are there two middles?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And if you&#039;re &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;devious, you can manipulate the lower class into attacking themselves as well. 

Thus we see the Murdochs and the Koch brothers propagandizing working class evangelicals into voting for people who slash taxes on billionaires -- all while collapsing the dollar (a gigantic, invisible tax on the middle and lower classes.)

Ted Turner famously said &quot;Christianity is a religion for losers.&quot;  Boy, did he nail it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed.  I wonder how long it&#039;s going to take to change their minds.  When I went in for my recent annual, I brought a full-page description of my various exercises, resting heart rate, morning and afternoon BP, morning, one-hour, and two-hour blood glucose readings after a typical meal, supplements, and description of diet (paleo) . . . and his response was to advise me that we all get sick and die.  He sees himself as a mechanic, and his virtuous fight is against his penny-pinching administrators , the insurance companies, and Big Pharma.  Oh well.  I just go in there for the insurance-covered physical, to ask a few questions, and to get the covered blood tests.  

One book which impressed me this year was The End of Medicine by Andy Kessler.  I also liked the TED talk by Daniel Kraft: &#039;Medicine&#039;s future? There&#039;s an app for that&#039; .]]></description>
