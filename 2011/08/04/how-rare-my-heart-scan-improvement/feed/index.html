		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

I&#039;d be a little cautious about concluding that eating a half-stick of butter every day will result in a significant CAC score reduction. Not that I think that the butter is detrimental, I eat a quarter of a stick every day myself, and lots of other saturated fat, a total of about 80 grams of it per day. My caution about concluding that saturated fat reduces CAC score is due to 2 things. First, the fact that my CAC score isn&#039;t going down, and second, the large uncertainty in each CAC score measurement, especially at the lower values of total score. Your Agatston score was initially 38 and it changed to 28.8 a year later, if I understand what you have said. That&#039;s great, but it&#039;s a relatively low level of calcium as these things go.

If we look at studies of reproducibility of CAC score where they have taken into account the score uncertainty as a function of score, we see considerable uncertainty. For example, the study &quot;Serial Electron Beam CT Measurements of Coronary Artery Calcium: Has Your Patient&#039;s Calcium Score Actually Changed?&quot;, by Sevrukov, Bland, and Kondos, 2005, suggests that if the measured CAC score is 40, the 95% repeatability limits on that value fall between 8.8 and 71 agatston units. Similarly, the 95% repeatability limits on a score of 30 is between 3 and 57. This is based on a large number of scores repeated serially within a short time. And the other major study of CAC reproducability is even worse. See &quot;Repeatability Limits for Measurement of Coronary Artery Calcified Plaque with Cardiac CT in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, by Chung, McClelland, Katz, Carr and Budoff,  2008;

I think we need a lot more tests of the hypothesis that butter, or saturated fat reduces calcium score before we can conclude that the hypothesis is valid. I&#039;ve been eating a high-fat, high-saturated fat diet for several years, and my CAC score continues to increase (although it may be slowing down, percentagewise).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With K being a fat soluble vitamin, I would guess that it is not responsible for the cognitive benefits since, as Seth wrote, you need to eat the butter regularly. I would think that the K would accumulate in the body and the benefits would be maintained for some time after due to the body mobilising its stores.

Does cheese provide a similar effect? If not, the differences between cheese and butter might hold clues to the mechanism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JohnN, re correlation or causation. The Genomera experiment, based on my findings, was an ABA design, where A = no butter and B = butter. It found a difference in outcome between A and B supporting causation. 

Re K2. I haven&#039;t noticed a difference in effect between cheap and expensive butters, which I would expect to differ in K2 content.

Re added sodium. I got the effect with unsalted butter. I haven&#039;t noticed a difference between salted and unsalted butter.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
There are probably more causation than correlation between your consumption of butter and improved brain functions. Have you considered, however, other factors such as K2 (mentioned by other posters), added sodium as electrolyte and brain running on ketone (not uniquely limited to butter)?
John
PS: is there any positive effect on teeth and dental health as well? The butter fat can break up dental plaque and neutralize the acidic environment created by the bacteria.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I think saturated fat is probably good for you, I don&#039;t see why you&#039;re focusing on it for heart scans.  My guess for the most likely hypothesis is that the Vitamin K2 in the butter (and maybe the Vitamins D and A too) is regulating your calcium so it goes into your bones instead of into your arteries.

Check out these posts on K2 and heart disease:

http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2008/06/vitamin-k2-menatetrenone-mk-4.html

Of course, the butter-calcium relation could be a many-factored effect, but the fat-soluble vitamins have a lot of evidence behind them.  It&#039;s not clear to me whether the fat itself is important or just a carrier for the vitamins.]]></description>
