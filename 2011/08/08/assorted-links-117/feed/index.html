		<description><![CDATA[Example of a nerve toxin similar to an insecticide:

Organophosphates are fairly complex poisons, where small differences can give similar properties.

Sarin is a potent nerve toxin for humans.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin

Diisopropyl-fluorophosphate is an insect poison, but to humans it is a medicine. It has a molecule very similar to Sarin, except it has two iso-propane groups instead of one.

		<description><![CDATA[The insecticide my parents used in our cabin many years ago was just a couple of atoms different from a neurotoxin developed for warfare, and it was very efficient against insects. But if it is that close to being directly lethal to humans, then it is likely to be damaging to humans, just not obviously so, because they test against that. And then there are all the random chemical reactions happening everywhere, surely changing some the insecticide to variants of the one for killing humans.

And then there is the farmer branch of my family tree, with a lot of clearly inherited aquired genetic defects. The farmer who was said to be sloppy with insecticides.]]></description>
