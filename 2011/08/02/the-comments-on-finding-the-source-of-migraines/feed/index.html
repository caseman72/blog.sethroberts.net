		<description><![CDATA[I have had migraines since I was a child and my 13 yr. old son has had them since he was 8. He was having 2/week with vomiting by age 10. 6 years ago I began suspecting my diet was the primary cause of my migraines. At that point they ruled my life and affected every aspect. Doctors, naturopaths, herbalists, acupuncturist, holistic MD’s, biofeedback, and medications did not help much or for long. After going gluten-free for unrelated reasons I noticed a small improvement immediately and thus began my search for an answer in my diet. 
I now avoid consuming artificial chemicals; all herbs and spices; most fruits and veggies (not all!); anything fermented; and generally avoid all grains. I also avoid strong and artificial scents. Foods that are high in amines, salicylates,  and tannins definitely cause headaches for me. If I follow the diet, I have no migraines.  My son follows a modified version of my diet and has a migraine less than every month. My best diet consists of meat, salt, butter, (Dr. Mercola  at http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/12/07/why-is-butter-better.aspx) has great info regarding the benefits of butter!), raw milk, egg yolk, cabbage, kale, lettuce, carrots, potatoes, apples, pears, and mango.  
David Buchholz, MD (Johns Hopkins neurologist) wrote a book, Heal Your Headache: The 123 Program, about the strong connection between headaches and diet and has a good explanation for the difficulty in determining headache triggers. And this sight is great for info on the potentially problematic chemicals in foods http://failsafediet.wordpress.com/.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The doctros were actually tinkering. They tried all drugs looking fr the effects. 

The only difrences were
More dangerous. Less emthodical (they do not measure methodically the effects daily). And pretending authority and science.


This is what a friend noted to me. That we do many tricks etc. Unconsciously, but do not notice it consciously.

PS. What is your new book about?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These reactions have everything to do with psychology and nothing to do with science.
A real man/woman of science would at a minimum look at Sarah&#039;s story as a fascinating lead that he/she can learn from and study further. A doctor with an ego sees someone going over his/her head and doesn&#039;t like it. 
(I was just going to use &quot;they&quot; &quot;there&quot; but I didn&#039;t want to upset the grammar police  :)   )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently suffered migraines up to 2 times per week which started in my right temple.  I thought I had tried everything - naturopath, chiropractor, regular neck stretches, avoiding common triggers (e.g caffeine, chocolate, red wine etc).  After seeing a very clever osteopath, we deduced that looking at the ergonomics of my desk at work was key because it was likely that my right shoulder was getting overworked from using the mouse with my right hand. She also gave me exercises to strengthen my mid back. The thing that made the greatest difference was swapping the mouse to my left hand (which required a few days training) and surprise, surprise, no migraines.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a certain ingredient in that is common in perfumes and personal care products that triggers migraines for me. I know it as soon as I smell it. My wife has had to throw out new soaps and lotions because of the &quot;smell.&quot; 

Another trigger for me is eating something made of processed carbs first when I am very hungry. Since I cut the wheat and most processed food out of my diet, I rarely get migraines anymore, and when I do they are usually pretty mild compared to the old days. 

Hardly anyone believes it though, and very few try it. People do not want to change how they are living, even if it is harming them. They prefer a short cut every time (i.e. drugs).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It&#039;s time to admit that data has joined &lt;i&gt;agenda&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;erotica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;insignia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;opera&lt;/i&gt;, and other technically plural Latin and Greek words that have become thoroughly Anglicized as singular nouns, taking singular verbs.
