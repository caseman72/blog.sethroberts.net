		<description><![CDATA[Seth, are you at all concerned with the phytoestrogen content of flaxseeds and the studies that have found a correlation between flaxseed consumption and prostate cancer?

I am really interested in the positive results on gum health and reduction of inflammation in general, but have thus far not started taking flaxseed due to my above concerns.  Have you or any other males taking daily flaxseed noticed increase in breast size, inflamed prostate, or any other side-effects?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Doesn&#039;t all this flax seed contribute lots of omega-6?&quot; No. The reason that the omega-3/omega-6 ratio is very high in flaxseed oil is that the ratio is very high in flax seeds. The oil extraction process does not discriminate between omega-3 and omega-6. It does not selectively remove omega-6.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Roberts, I&#039;m I losing out by nuking my flaxseed with water, for 30 seconds to warm it up (not boiling.)  Or how about mixing it with water heated to around 80C?]]></description>
