		<description><![CDATA[That magnesium effect is fascinating. I do not take magnesium but I will try it.

It&#039;s not &quot;elongase fatty acids&quot; but &quot;fatty acids elongase&quot; (an enzyme that elongates fatty acids).  Your idea makes sense to me but I cannot judge how plausible it is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I started taking 260g of magnesium in form of magnesium glycinate and this works wonders too, my mood improved clearly. Do you supplement magnesium too? It would be interesting to evaluate.

Now, I was thinking: maybe flaxseed oil is more effective than fish oil to improve cognitive function, not because ALA conversion to EPA and DHA, but mainly because ALA and EPA conversion uses elongase fatty acids, thus reducing elongase fatty acids available, needed to LA conversion into arachidonic acid, wich could increase inflammation. What do you think about it?

Very nice blog :)]]></description>
