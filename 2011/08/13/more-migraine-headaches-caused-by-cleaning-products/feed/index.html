		<description><![CDATA[My migraines are without a doubt CAUSED by aerated Chemical cleaning products. Caused. Not amplified. I use natural liqui cleaning products only. I can without a doubt prove this if given a scientific environment. I can&#039;t be around any aerated artificial scents either such as junk perfume (and some &#039;nice&#039; ones) febreeze air fresheners etc. 
The funny thing is, Ive found that if I have a bad migraine I usually have a severe sneezing attack at some point. At which time the headache, auras, nausea and bleariness start to dissipate. For the life of me hough I can&#039;t force myself to sneeze before that hough. I wish I could.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It may be that some people have olfactory auras, but I absolutely get headaches, and migraines from artificial, and even some natural fragrances.  Every year when the lilacs bloom, hyacinth and lily of the valley too, I have constant headaches.  I am not hallucinating flowers, and the life-long consistency of the response is pretty telling. However, it is interesting to me that I can lower my sensitivity in other ways.  For years any strong floral scent gave me migraine, but changing my diet, exercising enough but not too much, taking magnesium and B vitamins, etc. have lowered my sensitivity so now only lilac time and stores that sell many scented products give me migraine.  Any way, it&#039;s hardly n=1, google fragrance migraine trigger and there are thousands of hits.  (I use only unscented household products because I also get serious eczema from scented products.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Barry, in my story about a woman who cured her own migraines, the woman discovered that if she avoided chemicals called artificial fragrances her migraines became less common. Cause and effect was shown beyond doubt. In this case, I think the chances of it being a coincidence are very low.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A trial study involving only one subject can’t demonstrate that Febreze causes migraine episodes in some people, because a trial using only one subject can’t rule out coincidence.

People who blame their migraines on odors are mistaking symptom for cause. Migraine symptoms can include “olfactory aura:” olfactory amplification, olfactory distortion, and even olfactory hallucination. Olfactory aura, like visual aura, often precedes the headache phase. Many migraine patients notice and remember strong or unusual odors right before onset of headache, and mistakenly conclude the odor must have caused or triggered the subsequent headache. The truth is, by the time they noticed the odor, the migraine episode had already been developing for some time.

It’s not

odor —&gt; headache

but rather

odor amplifies  headache.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Febreze / headache case is not an outlier. Here is an example of a WHO meeting in May where Spanish physicians demanded inclusion of multiple chemical sensitivity in the WHO ICD10 code list.
   http://www.ei-resource.org/columns/multiple-chemical-sensitivity/world-health-organization-meeting-on-mcs-and-ehs/
What is interesting is the number of people affected -- estimated at around a 15% prevalence worldwide. Then add in the migraine sufferers, asthmatics, people with chronic respiratory conditions... chemical triggers are very common in these illnesses, as well as less obvious illnesses such as chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. For some reason doctors refrain from informing patients about such common irritants, and most people have no idea of the epidemic happening right in front of them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would venture that it&#039;s the fragrance component of the Febreze that&#039;s offensive and probably not the b-cyclodextrin. I&#039;m actually very curious to know if these migraine sufferers react the same way to unscented Febreze? I think the cyclodextrin molecules are too big to get properly airborne? 

Of course this would require a double blind randomized trial. (I&#039;m a scientist so even with self experimentation I run the control. My doctor made fun of me for doing that last time I had an appointment.)

Also, &quot;natural&quot; cleaning products are usually just similar surfactants with some citronellol to make it smell &quot;natural.&quot; I&#039;ll grant that I&#039;d rather the citronallol than the artificial scents, but still. The marketing of this stuff drives me bonkers.]]></description>
