		<description><![CDATA[Food spoilage bacteria are harmless

Anastacia Marx de Salcedo of Slate explains the difference between spoilage bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. It turns out the the bacteria that stinks and makes food look disgusting is harmless, but the bacteria that makes you sick &quot;provide no sensory clues as to their presence in food.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Re the &quot;smells bad but good for us&quot; thing:  An intriguing point!

I feel that our relationship to the smell &amp; flavor of fermented food is complex.  The initial reaction---&quot;this is stinky&quot;---can be accounted for as a useful aversion to garbage or rotten food.  As humans evolved, an aversion to foodborne bacteria may have been quite useful, e.g. avoiding salmonella could have been more immediately advantageous than cultivating stomach cultures.  

In my experience, most children can&#039;t tell fermented food from rotten food.  But we learn:  it&#039;s normal for adults to have a taste for wine, veined cheese, pickles, etc.  I love gorgonzola cheese, and absolutely hated it when I was a kid, but I can still understand exactly why it smells like garbage to someone without a taste for it.

Isn&#039;t it possible that the mechanisms that tell us &quot;this is bad; don&#039;t eat it&quot; can be retrained when it&#039;s to our advantage.  They can be taught to &quot;make exceptions.&quot;  Other instincts can be modified:  for instance, contact lens wearers have trained themselves to suppress their blinking instinct when they&#039;re putting in their lenses.  They &quot;make an exception,&quot; but leave the blinking instinct otherwise intact.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[good question, Mike, why would stuff that smells objectionable be good for us? Perhaps a large part of the (mild) aversion is cultural, lack of exposure to strong smells and a belief that bacteria are bad. In ancient times there was plenty of exposure to strong smells and the concept of bacteria didn&#039;t exist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Intriguing point, Seth!  I spoke (on the NYT site) to her mourning over her perceived benefit of spontaneity and abandon in approaching food.

From the list, it seems as if she is going quite a bit for mouth feel.

Your assertion that you rarely use spices is interesting, too.  I learned how to make yogurt, and eat it almost daily.  But I add cocoa power, cayenne, ginger, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spices to it. I also heavily add spices and herbs to protein and vegetable dishes. That seems to add to the satiety factor in my case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve also been making my food taste good by adding ferments - lamb meatballs, for example, with a sauce made by adding homemade goat yogurt and a squeeze of lemon to the pan juices. Fermented lemonade with a hint of nutmeg, either drunk on it&#039;s own or transformed into gelatin and served with fermented cream. So, so simple and tasty!

A lost art, really... if people understood how easy it is to ferment your own foods, why would they buy sour cream, sauerkraut etc from the store? And as to the mass-produced thing... @mike kenny many foods like pickles that were traditionally fermented are now just pickled, with vinegar etc creating that sour taste we love so much, as opposed to being rammed in a big barrel and left to the whims of bacteria.]]></description>

one thing that really puzzles me is, why would stuff that smells objectionable be good for us, and indeed taste good? very odd--just going on a certain evolutionary logic, wouldn&#039;t we be wired to want to avoid stuff that stinks? but then we eat it and like it. very odd. maybe the shortage of food in our ancestral environment made us less picky about smells and we made some happy discoveries.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you sure fermented foods can&#039;t be high-end or impressive?! Wine, cheese...? I used to live in Korea, and a restaurant&#039;s reputation could be made or ruined by the quality of it&#039;s various kimchi. The fermented skate is a very special delicacy (like Iceland&#039;s Hákarl), and also one of the worst things I&#039;ve ever tried in my life. I live in Japan now, and in Kyoto especially, the humble pickle has definitely been raised to an art form. Certain mountain villages are as famous for their pickles as certain Turkish ones are for their sweet figs.

On a side note, it&#039;s always the mountainous regions in Japan and Korea that are famous for their pickled foods. I always assumed this was because the colder winters meant they needed foods to keep, but I&#039;ve been wondering lately if it&#039;s not equally because of limited access to fresh seafood, which fermented foods could compensate for somewhat nutritionally.]]></description>
