		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t see why womanizing and acting like an asshole is a mark of individualism.  in the society i was brought up in, it&#039;s just a sign of lack of respect for other people.  can someone enlighten me in this?

for instance, can you tell me, does he like women that match society&#039;s ideal sense of beauty or does he make up his own mind about this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You got diverted because you only like individuality that conforms to your beliefs.  ie, you despise individuality.

TM outrages you because he gets how irrelevant non-individuals like you are and acts according to it.  That courage, plus hard work and tremendous intelligence, have given him more of a platform than you&#039;ll ever have. Despite (actually because of) the fact that you only ever say the &quot;right&quot; things.

You flatter yourself that you&#039;re striking a blow for something.  But you&#039;re just being predictable, common and snotty.  Even after a talk universally regarded as one of the most interesting at AHS, you&#039;re lobbying for him to be silenced in the future. 

That makes you the asshole.

Parrotting PC contempt counts for nothing.  Multiply you by ten million, the product is still nothing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jscott: You are right, I have deviated from the bigger point in this discussion about individuality and Seth&#039;s remarks on the importance of being different and unique. I got caught up in the example of an individual instead of the main point itself because I do not think that it is a good example. I disagree with Seth that the speaker is being respected for telling the truth. I think that it is exactly because of his drunken stories. 

Trying to change the world to be a better place, Gandhi style, takes courage and guts. Being a proud asshole, praised for &#039;individuality&#039;, does not. There is not much individuality in being an asshole. Being individual is much more than that. And by the way, both Buddhist philosophers and Gandhi emphasized not using other people. 

I guess I got diverted because I really like the main about individuality, but I do not like the example lacking it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[“Olga”
It seems that T.Max might be blinding you from Seth’s point. You do not like that Max is not contrite and that he is elevated because of his antics. Fine.

The highest form of honesty comes when dealing with myself. The inner world. You are associating things with me I did not say. So, fine Tucker has been a bad bad boy.

Now what?

We could have been talking about individuality and fear and why so many of us stay in the middle of the pack instead of doing something great or at least something real.

This, at least for me, started once I was able to express myself without protection of anonymity. To be able to take criticism and to deal with me while leaving the judgement of the world at large alone. You know, a Buddhist or Gandhi type of thing. Awake to awaken others or be the change you want to see in the world blah blah.

Now, back to fear and individuality…]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this blog post misses the point entirely.  Written from a male, privileged perspective, its easy (but disappointing) to see why.

Max is consistently celebrated as a, bold, ballsy, writer who isn&#039;t afraid to speak truth.  

Fine.

But, I think it&#039;s dangerous to ignore his content.  How he treats women, how they (at times) allow themselves to be treated, and how he takes advantage of them (or situations) when they&#039;re intoxicated - isn&#039;t bold, new and different.  It&#039;s actually cowardly, old and extremely common.

A majority (not all) of women are deeply offended and emotionally affected by his writing.  Personally, I think exploring &quot;why&quot; is far more interesting than Tucker Max himself.  There&#039;s nothing, at all, new about him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jscott: I am not really following your thoughts here. Why is honesty associated with offensive and &#039;wrong&#039;? 
I would agree that admitting that one is wrong is honesty. But I don&#039;t see it here. Bragging of insulting other people is not. Using other people for advantages of one person without regard for other people feelings is not. Again, an asshole is just an asshole. There is nothing really heroic about it. 

Tom: I do not have blithering hatred of anything male. An asshole can be a female. It is just a category. I just don&#039;t see anything heroic to be proud to be an asshole. On some level, it simply assumes that everybody around is an asshole - just uncertain about it. 
However, I do wonder why you consider somebody&#039;s bragging of using, humiliating, and degrading other people as highest standard of honesty. Or is this so difficult for you to accept that women are human too?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am so bored by the &quot;Olgas&quot; of the world and their blithering hatred of anything male.

And I am disgusted that these liars have cowed 99% of our society with their moronic, libelous shrieking.

And I am delighted that the AHS is in the 1%.

It makes sense that AHS would be. But God damn, it&#039;s a delightful surprise, nonetheless.

And even though most of the people blogging about TM have written about being &quot;surprised&quot; about his acquitting himself well -- I think they&#039;re lying, too.  Even John Durant -- he&#039;s LYING.  I think Durant KNEW Tucker Max would take his AHS slot seriously and KNEW Max would do a good job. But Durant is PRETENDING that this surprised him -- because for Durant to acknowledge that he expected an intelligent, interesting talk from TM might cause others to think that Durant holds the &quot;wrong&quot; opinion about TM in other areas.

Lying is so fucking endemic in our culture that people don&#039;t even know when they&#039;re lying any more.]]></description>

The asshole is just a category.  Some people can benefit.  It matters not to me.  I might need your category of honesty.  One that OTHER people might find offensive and &quot;wrong.&quot;  

But it might help me and 100 others.

		<description><![CDATA[Fear is central to most discussions dealing with anything ancestral.  Thought provoking post, Seth.  

Robert Greene&#039;s book, The 50th law deals with the issue of fear and highlights another figure that is not popular with the pressed and polite crowd.  Fantastic book that made me cringe a bit.

Odd thing about not exposing who we are is that it creates the very anxiety (of not wanting to be found out) we are trying to avoid.  A prison of sorts.  One that we have constructed.

Thanks for the reminder.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...the notion that you are different and have something unique to add becomes less and less plausible to you. Because it becomes implausible, that possibility doesn’t enter into your calculations about what to do with your life — in particular, what job to choose.&quot;

This is so true. Growing up, I always wanted to be a writer, but there was this idea that so few writers are able to make a living at it... what makes me think I could be one of them? Instead, I ended up going into a field (software designer - i.e., programmer) where &quot;success&quot; is practically guaranteed.]]></description>
