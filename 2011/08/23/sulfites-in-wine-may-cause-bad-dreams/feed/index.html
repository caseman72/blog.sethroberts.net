		<description><![CDATA[I had to give up drinking red wine because it was causing bad dreams. Quite reliably, a glass or two of red wine in the evening would lead to really awful, hyper-emotional dreams, often about suicide. Given that in the daytime I&#039;m one of the world&#039;s cheeriest and most appreciative people, this clearly wasn&#039;t right, and it clearly wasn&#039;t me. Gave up the red wine, the bad dreams (at least those bad dreams) went away. White wine and spirits don&#039;t bother me similarly. I&#039;ve run into other people who&#039;ve had similar problems with red wine, god knows the term &quot;red-head&quot; (for being bothered by red wine) is pretty common.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Supposedly all wine has naturally occurring sulfites. When a bottle of wine indicates that no sulfites are added, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that it is sulfite-free. Perhaps the form which is artificially added to wine is more harmful than the naturally occurring one? Or maybe it&#039;s a matter of quantity?]]></description>
