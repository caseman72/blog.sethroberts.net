		<description><![CDATA[Interesting list.  2 quick thoughts ...

I&#039;m &quot;justsomeguy&quot;, but I thought Tryptophan was illegal in US ?
Thought that&#039;s why folks take GABA or 5-htp as an alternative to boost Serotonin.

B-complex very important, but suspect Flintstones brand includes a sweetener that ain&#039;t so healthy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex: One possible explanation for the fact that almost anything you try &quot;works&quot; to treat depression is simple regression toward the mean. Assuming your depression level has cyclical and/or random variable components to it, you are likely to seek professional help when you are in or have just been through an *unusually bad* period. Sample a random period some time later and through chance alone it&#039;ll tend to be better than that, regardless of what potions the witch doctor prescribed. Therefore, you&#039;ll think the potions worked.

If you&#039;re *really* depressed, you might not have the energy to go see someone. So if you get up and try something, that&#039;s already a symptom that you&#039;re recovering.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you look at clinical trials for depression, you find that no matter &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; treatment you try, everything seems to work.  (And when I say &quot;treatment&quot;, I don&#039;t mean just pills -- I mean stuff like exercise, meditation, etc.).  The important thing seems to be do &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; to address the problem, as opposed to just lying in bed or whatever.  So I&#039;m not surprised that Fenn&#039;s elaborate regimen had an effect.  The more-interesting question is &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it worked.

The graph is also curious for the amount of variability that he experiences.  Note the data points toward the far-right side.  I wonder what&#039;s going on there.]]></description>
