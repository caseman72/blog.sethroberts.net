		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Since butter is just heavy cream whipped, have you tried drinking the appropriate amount of heavy cream, or do you think there is something in the change from one state (liquid) to the other (sort of solid?) that makes it beneficial?

I know that as far back as the 1950s, bodybuilders used to use heavy cream as a staple of their diets:

http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=heavy+cream+bodybuilder+1950s

If you really think about it, bodybuilders have been self-experimenting for their data for some amount of decades now. And their self-experimentation which has yielded significant results, as you might predict, is argued against by establishment figures. As an example, you can still see a lot of dietitians (maybe even the majority) argue that extra protein is not needed if someone engages in a heavy weight lifting program. This advice is mostly rejected by almost everyone involved in a heavy weight lifting program that has seen significant results (which are of course, tracked in a log book, like any good self-experiment).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting short article from biology writer Robert Dunn on lactose tolerance: 

http://www.robrdunn.com/2011/05/the-secret-truth-about-lactose-defficiency/

He says lactose tolerance genes have evolved independently from the European lactose tolerance gene several times in Africa and in other nomadic populations, but they were ignored because none of the genetic databases have much coverage of non-Western populations until one researcher traveled through Africa and did her own genetic sampling.

Also, there are African tribes that exhibit lactose tolerance without having any known lactose tolerance gene, raising the possibility of population-wide gut flora adaptions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -

If you had no trouble consuming more butter, how much would you eat daily?  Also what kind of trouble are you experiencing?  I&#039;ve consumed as much as 1/2 a stick twice a day.  It took a few tries for my digestive system to adapt, but now I don&#039;t experience any problems.

Lastly, where are you finding unpasteurized butter?

TIA]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Tom,

I am not quoting from the book titled &#039;The China Study&#039; by T. Colin Campbell.  I have that book checked out from the library right now and about every 20 pages I am tempted to throw it against the wall whenever Campbell proudly points to something as proof of his assumptions, and meanwhile I remember clearly how Taubes or Minger or one of the paleo bloggers has previously destroyed that argument.  

I took my information directly from the China Study data.  I found the data by chasing the links in Denise Minger&#039;s reviews of Campbell&#039;s analysis.  My assumption is that the data itself is valid, since both Denise Minger and Ned Kock have used it for statistical analysis.  The text extracts I used were taken from the PDF titled &#039;Mono_Diet_Survey.pdf&#039; (which, on the CTSU web page, is labeled &#039;Diet survey intake&#039;).]]></description>
