It even got a prize for being the best office chair, so they discontinued it.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using a standing desk for about a year and have discovered something my physician friend says is well known among people who have to stand all day -- that being able to have one foot higher than the other makes a big difference. This is implemented in a few different ways -- the desk I made uses a Geekdesk, which has a horizontal bar conveniently place for leaning a foot against, I&#039;ve also used a small rubbermaid stool, and most recently I&#039;ve been standing on a partly inflated Bosu ball (which helps me work on my balance). 

I also have a table I sit at when I&#039;m meeting with students and a comfortable chair with footrest that I can sit in if I&#039;m just reading a long paper, and I do move back and forth among these locations.

The big advantage I find in standing is that it makes it easier for me to pace around or to take short walks; the minor gravity well of sitting in a chair seems to inhibit some of that activity.

But I note that if I end up sitting all day I&#039;m a bit stiff at the end, and I don&#039;t have that experience with my standing desk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Several months ago I switched over to standing at my computer.  My sleep has been much better since.  (There is one other change that I made at that time, so I&#039;m not positive it&#039;s the standing, but I think it is.)  This change to standing at the computer replaced about 3 hours of sitting with 3 hours of standing.

As for a chair that leans back with legs supported, I have one of those, the Lazboy Forte Reclina-Rocker.  Not standard cubicle equipment.  (I work from home so I can get away with it.)  I have two problems with extended sessions in the recliner: (1) I get sleepy and (2) it hurts my lower back when I read.  Mostly I use it for short naps, light reading, or when I have to sleep while keeping the head elevated, such as when suffering nasal congestion.

I think the better approach involves sitting straight.  If I remember correctly, Esther Gokhale in &#039;8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back&#039; recommends this approach to sitting.  Another expert on posture whom I respect, Professor Cheng Man-ching, said, &quot;The back of the chair is for hanging your coat.&quot; Wolfe Lowenthal explained that meant you should not lean back in your chair.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I lounge-like sit I simply lean back in my chair and put my legs on the desk. I can obtain the same position you describe.  I&#039;ve been doing this naturally for quite some time; it just feels right, most likely because it helps even-out blood flow throughout the body. (Usually the part of the knee down to the feet goes on the desk.) It&#039;s easy for me to reposition myself because sometimes I like to sit normally as well.]]></description>
