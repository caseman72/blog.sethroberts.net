		<description><![CDATA[Prof. Colquhoun, I have fixed the spelling of your name, thanks for the correction. 

As for the rest of your comment, I am glad you never took the &quot;serotonin hypothesis&quot; seriously. Because antidepressants are far more important than acupuncture, that theory would have been a far more interesting target of criticism than an acupuncture experiment. You say that stimulating the immune system is the &quot;eternal mantra of every quack&quot;. And I say that few pharmacology professors know how to stimulate the immune system. We seem to agree here. If you would like evidence that the immune system can be stimulated, you should study the many connections between better sleep and better health. I am sure that sleep stimulates the immune system. If you would like to see evidence of immune stimulation by something like drugs, check out studies of the effects of probiotics on health. Finally, as for statistics, I believe that your criticism of the acupuncture graphs was misleading and you failed to point out a really big blunder in the acupuncture paper -- ignoring half of their data when answering their biggest question. But perhaps we agree here too.  You say peer reviewers make big mistakes. I say you -- who surely review many papers -- made big mistakes. You see the similarity of our positions, I hope. It seemed to me that the pot was calling the kettle black. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, you may have written a book about diet, but I have written a textbook on statistics.  If you want to get mathematical I&#039;ll take happy to take you on,

You really shouldn&#039;t invent things.  I have never from its start thought much of the &quot;serotonin hypothesis&quot;.  As it happens I&#039;m talking tomorrow to clinicians about, among other things, that downfall of SSRIs, once the whole evidence emerged (and incidentally, the downfall with them of St John&#039;s Wort, which every herbalist boasted is as good as SSRIs.

Talking of made up theories, the corniest of all has to be &quot;stimulating the immune system&quot;.  There is, and never has been, any evidence that it happens -it is the eternal mantra of every quack who is trying to sell you their own brand of implausible therapy.

Incidentally, it is considered polite to spell authors&#039; names correctly.

		<description><![CDATA[Another anti-bacteria point that occurred to me this morning.

The usual way acupuncture trials are blinded are by sticking in needles in places which *aren&#039;t* the special chi meridians or whatever hogwash that particular acupuncture claims.
Presumably both the meridians and random points near meridians are equally unclean, and so studies should never show a difference beyond random noise and bias if the bacteria point were true (both &#039;control&#039; and experimental groups being equally contaminated); but acupuncture is still a live issue, so...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; In this context, sticking needles into someone, which puts a small amount of bacteria into their blood, is not absurd.

In the vast acupuncture literature, no particular importance has been noted about breaking the skin barrier... eg. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081201082353.htm

&gt; 109 received traditional acupuncture, with needles penetrating the skin in particular points. According to ancient Chinese tradition, the needle is twisted until a certain &#039;needle sensation&#039; arises. The other 106 patients received a simulated acupuncture instead, with a telescopic, blunt placebo needle that merely touches the skin. The acupuncture was performed by physiotherapists two or three times a week throughout the five-week radiation period.
&gt;
&gt; Afterwards 95 percent of the patients in both groups felt that the acupuncture treatment had helped relieve nausea, and 67 percent had experienced other positive effects such as improved sleep, brighter mood, and less pain.]]></description>
