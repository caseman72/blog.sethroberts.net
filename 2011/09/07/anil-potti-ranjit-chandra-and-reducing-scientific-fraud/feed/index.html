		<description><![CDATA[Your comment about Nevins reminds me of someone -- I forget who, I may have seen it on Andrew Gelman&#039;s blog -- who blamed problems with his article on a graduate student who had not been listed as a co-author. In other words, &quot;I get the credit and my peons take the blame.&quot; What a deal!]]></description>

Here&#039;s my favorite line from the article: &quot;I find it ironic that we have been yelling for three years about the science, which has the potential to be very damaging to patients, but that was not what has started things rolling.&quot;

Bad science didn&#039;t bring Potti down, padding his resume did.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe you&#039;re arguing that the probability of a positive result given an error is small. And I agree. Mistakes usually don&#039;t help your case. But consider the opposite probability, the probability of an error given a positive result.

Suppose you&#039;re working in an area where positive results are few and far between. What is the probability that a promising result resulted from a bungled analysis? Possibly high. If nearly every result is truly negative, the positive ones that catch our attention are likely to be in error. There could be an effect analogous to stochastic resonance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I followed the Potti story more closely at the beginning than now. My colleagues were the ones who tried and failed to reproduce the analysis. At first it looked like incompetence. Now more people are suggesting fraud.

It&#039;s sobering to realize how difficult it was to get anyone to acknowledge there was a problem here. Baggerly and Coombes had to be very persistent in their criticism before people started to pay attention. Eventually it became a scandal, but it would not have been if they had given up after, say, a year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Factor 4 does prove that the oversight committees are incompetent at oversight. They&#039;re either not using the obvious metrics or invalidly explaining away negative results. 

As always, I distrust official pronouncements unless I have specific evidence to confirm them. 

Historically, such committees have been rubber-stamp providers, used as political gatekeepers. For example, if these scientists and committees were Chinese, everyone would just assume it was all political. 

In this case, we have specific evidence that they are similar to the historical norm.

Fact is, unravelling the support for the corrupt institution is highly complex. (That&#039;s why they&#039;re the historical norm.) For example, having the entire voting public well-versed in history would do it - it would be well known they&#039;re usually 100% political - but that&#039;s impossible. In any case, the perverse incentives have to be disrupted, and these particular perverse incentives are due to system-wide perverse incentives. 

Though, eventually it will go away on its own. Rubber-stamp enough fraudulent studies, and even the thickest observer will realize the scientists aren&#039;t reliable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, you&#039;re right, I have not heard the data &quot;questioned&quot; -- just the whole analysis, which could be said to include more than the data. On the other hand, you are the first person I&#039;ve heard say that perhaps Potti was merely sloppy -- that is, made honest mistakes. The whole picture doesn&#039;t support that conclusion. There were too many problems, for one thing. And the effect of all the supposed sloppiness was far too favorable for the sloppy person.]]></description>
