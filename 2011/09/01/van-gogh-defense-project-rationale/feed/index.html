		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! That is a very clear description of what you went through. I love the name Van Gogh Defense Project. As you you have experienced with intensity what some of us go have only felt at a mild level, I think this is inspiring. After reading this I want to track my mood because this is very relevant and its about self awareness. I think getting to know ourselves better is the dream and goal of a philosopher/Writer  and having years of data can really help improve my life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want to thank Seth&#039;s colleague &quot;John&quot; for articulating and sharing this. I am not bipolar, but I do have relatively mild manic tendencies, and I am very vulnerable to serious depression and work hard to find ways to avoid/avert it, with reasonable success the last decade or so. I periodically rediscover how important good circadian rhythms are in protecting me from depression -- getting up and getting sunlight early in the morning makes a big difference. (A realization I owe to Seth.)

Reading &quot;John&#039;s&quot; account is helpful. It&#039;s a real challenge to maintain some objectivity about one&#039;s moods and the factors that may be influencing them; it requires real work -- and work that one should not try to do entirely alone. The help and feedback of loved ones, colleagues, etc. is important. And gaining valid causal knowledge of what is influencing your mood is crucial -- I find it regrettable that the therapeutic establishment that I sought help from for many years had little valid knowledge. They mostly wanted me to revisit the &quot;repressed&quot; emotions of my childhood -- that road led only to more suffering and was mostly a waste of time. My impression is that many people of my baby boomer generation are learning to become managers of their moods, weight, sleep, energy, relationships, etc.... 

Thanks again, &quot;John&quot;.]]></description>
