		<description><![CDATA[&quot;OMG we gave trillions of $$$ to the banks? Michelle Malkin never told me!&quot;

The federal government bought up trillions&#039; worth of worthless toxic assets from the banks. http://sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=9e2a4ea8-6e73-4be2-a753-62060dcbb3c3:  They have NOT SPENT ONE DIME in aid for defaulting homeowners.  Hispanic or not.

Furthermore, the homes were foreclosed on.  They represent assets RETURNED to the banks.  This is not too hard to figure out.  The people who bought homes they couldn&#039;t afford and are now out on the street?  No, they&#039;re not the ones who took our money and ran.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where does this 2.2 trillion figure come from? I think it is completely fabricated.  The CEO of Wells Fargo was recently paid $21 million in a year.  That is a lot, maybe too much and excessive, but it would take 22 thousand pay packages this size to add up to 2.2 trillion over 5 years, and only a handful of execs are paid like this. What exactly constitutes a &quot;banker&quot;, are they including hedge funds and investment banks like Goldman Sachs? Maybe the are including all of the rank and file bank employees -- suggesting that bank tellers are overpaid? I think some fact checking is in order before accepting this argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The five trillion was not stolen by the banksters.  Check all that spam in your inbox.  Along with the ads for real viagra, fake viagra, and viagra manufactured in violation of patents, you will see offers of no money down loans.

A very large number of people, most of them Hispanic, many of them with no job or legal income, purchased million dollar houses no money down, and never made a payment on them.  If the price went up, they intended to flip them for a profit.  If the price went down, they intended to live in it rent free indefinitely.

And who is responsible for the bright idea of lending to such people?  
You will find the answer at  http://www2.fdic.gov/crapes/2007/32069_071001.pdf]]></description>
