		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Try to believe me when I say that when you are in the midst of a depression (which is NOT the same as ‘being in a bad mood’) and you suddenly feel the clouds lifting you will KNOW it is because of the pills you have been taking, not the result of the placebo effect. Especially if you, like many others, have tried different drugs before you found one that works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sorry, but that methodology doesn&#039;t work. Assume for the sake of argument that your depression is either environmental, seasonal, or cyclical - something that gets triggered at time T and then sometime much later at time U goes away. What does that look like to somebody who takes pills? You go to the doctor, who prescribes pill A; it doesn&#039;t seem to work, so the doctor prescribes pill B which also doesn&#039;t seem to work, and so on until time U is achieved. Since time U happens a couple weeks after you&#039;ve started drug D, you are now utterly convinced drug D is the &quot;one that works&quot;.

Regression toward the mean explains much of the apparent effect of antidepressants.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As Jazi yechezkel zilber said above
&quot;... placebo is superior, as it does not contain harmful chemicals.&quot;

I am strongly opposed to using &quot;harmful chemicals&quot; (drugs) of any kind for myself. Despite the severe scoldings I get from doctors, I currently use no prescription medicines, no over-the-counter meds (not even aspirin or vitamins), and certainly no alcohol, tobacco or illegal drugs.

My resolve may be severely tested this weekend. This Friday, September 30, I am scheduled for some surgery. (If I had my way, it would be done without anesthesia, but the surgeon will not do it without anesthesia.)

The surgeon has told me that I will need medication for pain after the surgery, and she plans to prescribe Lortab (hydrocodone).

I told her that I would not take hydrocodone, or even fill the prescription. As I told her:

&quot;I have only had one hydrocodone pill in my life, and it made me feel so good that I immediately threw the other 17 pills away. As far as I&#039;m concerned, the only thing worse that a drug that makes me feel bad is a drug that makes me feel good, because the feel-good drug is the one that could get me addicted.&quot;

That screaming you will hear this weekend will be me suffering without pain meds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Alex:  Thanks for your comment about your experience with D3.  I&quot;m guessing that over a longer time frame you will likely realize many other benefits, apart from the subject matter in this string.  In any event,  it&#039;s certainly clear that more research on the topic of finding effective, inexpensive treatments for those who experience depression is needed.

But more broadly re vitamin D supplementation, based on the reading and research I&#039;ve been doing for quite awhile, and my own experience with adding D3 over some four years and continuing, I&#039;ll just mention that eliminating the deficiency can have a number of other benefits, including prevention (or avoidance) of things we would all like to avoid.  But rather than me going OT reciting the litany of potential benefits and cluttering up Seth&#039;s excellent blog, you might be interested in checking out a blog such as that of Dr. William Davis (Heart Scan blog) and the website of the Vitamin D Council.  They both provide a lot of useful info, including, inter alia, advice as to the desireable level of serum 25(OH)D for most individuals to realize the full benefits (based, e.g., on Dr. Davis&#039; own clinical experience) which is significantly higher than the conventional view of something like 25-30 ng/ml.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, your suggestion that needing to see faces of others (and to converse with them) in the a.m. is intriguing.  It makes sense if we think about the fact that humans are essentially social animals, seek friendships, and crave regular interaction with others.

And here&#039;s another thought:  Why hasn&#039;t the issue of widespread vitamin D deficiency been explored more throughly?  There has been a good deal of writing (and some scientific examination) into the fact that vitamin D deficiency is rampant in modern society (especially in climes where sunlight is weaker).  And there is apparently evidence that using light therapy, or raising the individual&#039;s blood levels of 25(OH)D through supplementation with vitamin D3, can be effective in treating SAD or other mood disorders.  So why hasn&#039;t there been more focused scientific inquiry along these lines?  Could it be that advising people to get more exposure to natural sunlight, or otherwise recommending they raise their serum level of vitamin D with supplementation, is just too simple, direct and cheap compared to drugs and psychiatric treatment, which are expensive?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, Vitamin C is easy to get now that we can synthesize it cheaply, just like fish/flax seed oil and Vitamin D pills..but human attention in forms that will alleviate depression?  Unfortunately that is a commodity too costly in US society for many people, hence the drive to replace therapy with pills.  I&#039;m reminded of Emily in Our Town, back from the dead for one day:  &quot;Oh Mama, just look at me for one minute as if you really saw....&quot;  Did Book TV really work for you?

Joe, I&#039;m not sure why you don&#039;t trust the government when you trust the highly paid health care administrators who deny people coverage and suck up 40% of our health care bill.  The hospital is the only place where a bandage can cost you $50 dollars, and you can&#039;t bring your own.  After being without insurance for almost two years, I&#039;m looking forward to the day when people don&#039;t have to &quot;choose&quot; between affording a pain pill and an antibiotic for lack of coverage like the young man in Cincinnati who died.  And I work and I pay taxes, thank you.  Health care or endless war?  I&#039;d like health care, please.]]></description>

idealy, we need people who handle something (audio) on a computer screen anyway.

we assign to two groups one with random visuals etc. the other with faces, and measure depression scales ( in a masked way, to avoid them knowing the idea. like asking various inventories)

I am thinking about where we can find a large enough group of people who can get easily subjected to such an experiment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, good quote, thanks.

Pablo, you write, &quot;If psychiatrists uncovered the relevant neural mechanisms involved in this process, they could in principle develop agents that mimicked the effect of morning faces in the brain.&quot; Think of it like this. Scurvy is due to lack of Vitamin C. But no one is going to make a living by &quot;developing agents that mimic the effect of [Vitamin C]&quot; because Vitamin C is easy to get.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jazi, thanks for your comment. You hit on something I have been wondering about. I have never really understood the absolute reliance on clinical trials in these matters. They do not seem to take into account that people can react very differently to the exact same thing. If our individual response to recreational drugs like cannabis and alcohol vary so dramatically why can this not be true for non-recreational drugs? Millions of people use paracetamol/acetaminophen successfully but it has never done a thing for me, for instance. Cannabis makes me very relaxed and in touch with my creative side, it makes plenty of other people tired and paranoid. Why would it be different with something like Prozac? It makes me wonder whether we might be missing out on some wonderful drugs just because they did not work on a large enough percentage of people.

I thought one of the major points that Mr. Roberts is making in his work is that absolute scientific proof is less important than finding something that works. I am not sure if anyone will ever prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that standing on one leg to improve sleep really works but in the meantime it seems like a good idea to try it when you are having sleep problems. 

To clarify: I am not from the US so as a result perhaps not so suspicious of our healthcare system as you guys are of yours. One of the perks of living in what a lot of Americans seem to fear so much: a &#039;socialist&#039; society.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I am generally in sympathy with the tenor of your article, but I do object to one argument you appear to be making towards the end of your post.  You conclude that psychiatry will never succeed in curing depression because (a) depression is due to environmental factors and (b) psychiatry cannot change the environment nor supply the &quot;cheap and abundant&quot; things that were present in the ancestral environment but missing in contemporary society.  This is a &lt;em&gt;non-sequitur&lt;/em&gt;.  Suppose your own hypothesis is correct and depression is caused by a failure to see faces in the morning.  The brain would still be implicated in this chain of causality: absence of morning faces will cause certain changes in the brain which would themselves cause people to feel and act depressed.  If psychiatrists uncovered the relevant neural mechanisms involved in this process, they could in principle develop agents that mimicked the effect of morning faces in the brain.  So it is not true that, because depression is ultimately caused by the environment, it falls outside the scope of psychiatry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David Perch,

I accept the possibility that a specific drug that is compatible to a specific person can work well for depression.

The studies of antidepresants use large grouos of people, so the personal compatibility is probably nonexistent.

In terms of scientific knowledge, however, we have no information. There are no strong effects in the studies, and we cannot take personal experience as proof. 

Practiclly speaking, i believe that science aside, what works for a person works. And it is foolish to avoid using a drug that proved highky effective for a person for whatever soohisticated thinking possible. (i would say that seth wuld accept this as kind of personal science)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely good analysis there... And I totally respect people who have used SSRI&#039;s and had great personal success, but you have to look at the problem from a scientific perspective. And if they don&#039;t make sense to all parties when you look at them scientifically, there needs to be a change somewhere. I&#039;m not sure whether that means trying to change public perception, medical practice, or research practices, but something needs to change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David -- a couple of things:

First, I have some experience with antidepressants.  From 1995 to 1998, I worked on the team that managed the antidepressant Zoloft (generic name: sertraline; known as Lustral in the UK and in some other countries).

Second, I don&#039;t think that introspection is a reliable method to distinguish placebo effects from true drug effects.  See, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherjones.com/politics/2003/11/it-prozac-or-placebo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which starts with the story of a person who participated in a clinical trial for an antidepressant.  The woman&#039;s response to the treatment was so profound that she was &lt;i&gt;astonished&lt;/i&gt; to find out that she had actually been enrolled in the placebo arm of the study.  I&#039;ve included the first few paragraphs below.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Janis Schonfeld recalls the events that started her on her recovery from 30 years of depression with snapshot clarity: the newspaper ad she saw in 1997 seeking subjects for an antidepressant study; the chair she was sitting in when she called UCLA&#039;s Neuropsychiatric Institute; the window she was looking out of when she first spoke with Michelle Abrams, the research nurse who shepherded her through the trial. She remembers being both nervous and hopeful when she arrived at the institute, and a little uncomfortable when a technician put gel on her head, attached a nylon cap shot through with electrodes, and recorded her brain activity for 45 minutes. But most of all she remembers getting the bottle of her new pills in a brown paper bag from the hospital pharmacy. &quot;I was so excited,&quot; she told me. &quot;I couldn&#039;t wait to get started on them.&quot;

Within a couple of weeks, Schonfeld, then a 46-year-old interior designer, got quickly and dramatically better, able once again to care for herself and her husband and daughter, no longer so convinced of her own worthlessness that she&#039;d consider killing herself. For the next two months, she came back weekly for more interviews and tests and EEGs. And by the end of the study, Schonfeld seemed to be yet another person who owed a nearly miraculous recovery to the new generation of antidepressants -- in this case, venlafaxine, better known as Effexor.

But during her final visit to the institute, one of the doctors directing the research sat her down to deliver some disturbing news. &quot;He told me I hadn&#039;t been taking a medicine at all. I&#039;d been on a placebo. I was totally shocked.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I am an avid reader of this blog and totally respect and admire Mr. Roberts&#039; sometimes unconventional way of looking at things. But I have to say I was disappointed in the one-sidedness of this article (and the comments on it so far). These opinions do not seem to come from people with personal experience with depression and/or anti-depressants. Why be so judgemental about something you know nothing about? 

Try to believe me when I say that when you are in the midst of a depression (which is NOT the same as &#039;being in a bad mood&#039;) and you suddenly feel the clouds lifting you will KNOW it is because of the pills you have been taking, not the result of the placebo effect. Especially if you, like many others, have tried different drugs before you found one that works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Talkig therapies work. But most of the effect is in the very act of coming to talk and the talking. 

Methods of talk therapy do not matter much.

When compared to &quot;placebo&quot; (i cannot remember how they managed to fix a placebo to. Tlk theraoy) there aRe clAims that it gives similar results.


I am fully supporting using the placebo effect (somehow medicine ignores ts strong effect, maybe not much money to make from. Or the delusion at we need &quot;something real&quot;).  Anyway, placebo is superior, as it does not contain harmful chemicals. One only needs to made the psychological staging as strong as possible. (the more professional looking, aura etc. The stronger the placebo effect)]]></description>
