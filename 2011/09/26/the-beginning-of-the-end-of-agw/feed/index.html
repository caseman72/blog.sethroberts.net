Doing the wrong thing is a reasonable approach at the individual level, but horribly bad at the State level where mistakes may go unacknowledged for decades.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Calls for scientific skepticism to yield to the political impulse to act (for the children, for the public good, for the planet, and to keep the money flowing) calls to mind what Bryan Caplan calls the &quot;Activist&#039;s fallacy&quot;: 

1.  Something must be done
2.  This is something
3.  Therefore, this must be done.

We know what causes earthquakes, but thankfully no one is seriously proposing a worldwide, trillion-dollar effort to stop continental drift. We do our best to understand it and deal with it. We don&#039;t pretend we&#039;re powerful enough to stop it.

As P.J. O&#039;Rourke points out, &quot;There are 1.3 billion people in China and they all want a Buick.&quot; If global warming is caused by burning fossil fuels, nothing can stop it. All the political action in the world will only waste scads of time and money.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You still haven&#039;t said what your null forecast or model for climate is, or even stated a reasonable burden of proof for non-experimental situations, so that you can never be proven wrong.

		<description><![CDATA[Tying the vindication of your butter and breakfast hypotheses to the ultimate repudiation of AGW shows very little confidence in your own ideas.

You still have not said whether you don&#039;t believe there&#039;s persuasive evidence that GW is occurring at all, or whether you don&#039;t believe there&#039;s any way that human activity can be causing the (manifestly observable) melting of the tundra.  The two positions are fundamentally contradictory.  Which is it?  Even days one, odd days the other?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Skepticism is--or should be--the hallmark of science. Unremitting questioning should be the order of the day in science. However, policy and action cannot operate on such standards. You confuse scientific skepticism--almost always a good thing--with rational judgment, which must, in the face of choices, always act in the face of uncertainty. When N=1, you&#039;d better be sure that you want to run the experiment. We&#039;re running an experiment in AGW, and based on the results so far, we&#039;d better think very strongly about stopping the experiment. The experiment is fun--unlimited energy makes all of our lives better by any material measure--but if we don&#039;t watch it, we could end up creating a mess for ourselves and future generations. That&#039;s what choice is about. 

BTW, how about an ideological Turing test for you? (E.g. http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html). Will you post the strongest possible arguments possible in support of AGW, and based upon that statement, make a set of policy recommendations? After doing so, you can then post what policies you do support and why you&#039;ve made that choice. 

Thanks,]]></description>
