		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
See Dan Gilbert&#039;s &quot;Stumbling on Happiness&quot; for (a delightful read and) another explanation of why we&#039;re so bad at predicting what we will feel in the future. We overpredict how difficult and how satisfying future events will be, because we remember distinctive events, not regular ones. Regular events would be more stable data sources for prediction.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nancy, my ideas about the value of fermented food are based on a wide range of data. very little from me. quite different from my other ideas, most of which involve a lot of data from me (e.g., butter). I am sure that we need fermented food to be healthy just as much as we need Vitamin C. I see no other plausible explanation for the wide range of data. I extrapolate to &quot;everyone&quot; partly because there is no group of people who don&#039;t need Vitamin C (or any other vitamin or necessary nutrient, such as iron). That&#039;s why I am sure this requirement (plenty of microbes in your diet) is universal. In large part because of the long history of nutrition. That being said, in a tiny number of cases fermented food has had bad effects. This shouldn&#039;t interfere with seeing the big picture. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree. Great provocative post Seth!

Don&#039;t forget the influence of professional roles and the situations they cast people in, and how this generates overconfidence and the unwillingness to objectively rate the degree of confidence one should have in a prediction, given the relative knowledge available. For example, psychiatry for most of its history has had virtually nothing to offer people suffering mental illness. (It has only a little now.) When we lack knowledge, the void gets filled with theory -- vast, rather obscure psychoanalytic theory based upon intuitions, much or most of which, in the light of subsequent evidence, has turned out to be nonsense. But the psychiatrists are faced with desperate patients and their families; they want to have an upper middle class income, like their other medical colleagues and they need to appear authoritative. They can&#039;t just say that they have no idea why someone suffers from schizophrenia or manic depression and that they really have no way to treat it. Who would pay them for that? 

Or look at economists, who cannot perform experiments with history to get causal knowledge and are only recently beginning to rely on psych experiments to see how economic cognition, affect and behavior function. I like Paul Krugman, but he did not know where the economy was headed in 1994, or in 2001, or in 2008; he was fairly clueless. Yet he is very confident that a massive stimulus program will have certain positive effects on the economy. And obviously politics distorts cognition in economics. 

Or nutrition and the over-authoritization that takes place there. 

Professionals have a lot of trouble just saying that they don&#039;t know much... I don&#039;t know how to sort out the effects of economic self interest, situational responses to the strong needs of those they serve, cognitive biases that are just part of the larger culture, and many other things, but it&#039;s a mess...]]></description>
