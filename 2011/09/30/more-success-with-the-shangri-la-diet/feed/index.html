		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve not done an extensive search of the forums, but I was curious if anyone has tried coconut oil for the preferred oil on the SLD.

I lost a bunch of weight back in 2006 trying SLD and I used ELOO and WO.  Both of those oils were gross to take and the WO was a bit worse, but I got used to them.

Just last week, I bought my first batch of coconut oil (CO) and I ingested it orally.  I was shocked that I did not taste anything!  I thought it would taste like coconut, but it really didn&#039;t have a taste.  In fact, when compared to ELOO and WO, CO had even less taste.  So I was curious to see if anyone has tried CO for SLD.]]></description>
