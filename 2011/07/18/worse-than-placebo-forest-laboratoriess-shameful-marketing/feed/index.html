		<description><![CDATA[Are there any laws preventing drug companies from pointing out the flaws in the drugs of their competitors? It seems like that would be a natural way to find this sort of thing out. Just like &quot;negative campaign ads&quot; are more informative - and more convincing - than positive ones, you could imagine a drug market in which the drugs that objectively did best were advertised as such (and false claims were investigated by the media and/or the courts as possible fraud). You could even include a standardized URL where all the fine print caveats are listed (instead of scrolling past pages of fine print spoken by a fast-talker)

Another thing to consider is that FDA approval is too binary: &quot;approved&quot; or &quot;unapproved&quot;. If we made FDA approval optional it seems likely something like Consumer Reports would come about to arbitrate not just whether drugs work but *how well* they work. Including ranking drugs against each other to see what the comparative advantage is.]]></description>
