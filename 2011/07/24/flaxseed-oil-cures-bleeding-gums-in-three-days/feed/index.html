		<description><![CDATA[I started taking 2 TB of flax oil daily about four days ago and now my gums are barely bleeding at all after I brush and floss.  My gums were red, swollen and would bleed after I brushed and flossed and are now pink and healthy looking.  

I&#039;ve had this problem for years and I could not understand why it would keep happening even though I was consistent with my dental routine.  I take the berry flavored Barlean&#039;s flax oil mainly because it tastes good and so I look forward to taking it- if it was gross I would not be consistent with taking it.  

Anyhow, thanks for the information!  I wish dentists would look into this but they probably won&#039;t so I&#039;m glad that you do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for some very informative articles on Flax.
Your post ‘flaxseed-oil-vs-fish-oil’ was a great brief snapshot for me.
Paul Jaminet pointed me over here, after i asked a question on ALA (from Flax oil).
Reading your posts has reinforced my recent decision to start back on the flax oil after i quit back in Jan this year (2011).
From memory i quit to reduce my Poly intake &amp; after reading some negative comments over at raypeat.com on linseed (flaxseed).

Have you tried Chia Oil, its EFA breakdown is very similar to Flax Oil, do you think it would work the same as Flax oil?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have also seen the benefits of Omega 3 oils in my patient&#039;s diet. In 3 different instances i have asked what the difference in their hygiene routine was...nothing, just adding the Omega 3. Of course this will not take the place of brushing and flossing as you see here...our writer began brushing and flossing better as well. The Omega3 reduces the inflammation in the body and thus the gum tissue improves as well. Bleeding gum is the body response to &quot;infectious&quot; bacteria remove the bacteria and the body response will return to less bleeding. Brushing Flossing and Omega3 things will look much better. Your gum graft may be a separate issue as the Omega3 oils will not change bone levels below the gum tissue however this is a separate issue and sounds like you are on a good track!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SM, I believe that omega-3 is responsible for several reasons, above all that others have gotten similar results with fish oil. &quot;Better to eat a good diet&quot;: It is much easier to vary the dose by varying amount of flaxseed oil. Varying the amount of omega-6 by varying the amount of &quot;good diet&quot; would be hard. Simply reducing the amount of omega-6 will not necessarily increase the amount of omega-3 in the brain. It may be much easier to increase the amount of omega-3 in the brain by increasing the amount in the diet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As always, interesting stuff, Seth.  What are you thoughts on the low human conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA, and, based on that, fish oil supplementation over flax?

Or is there a constitute of flax beyond EPA &amp; DHA that is reducing inflammation?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

The overall effect seems substantiated, but the mechanism, not so much. How do you know it&#039;s the omega 3? And wouldn&#039;t it be pretty easy to test this -- just substitute the flaxseed oil for fish oil and see if the effect remains? If anything, the effect should be stronger, since omega 3 from animal sources is shown to be much better assimilated by humans.

Also, if it is in fact omega 3 (a big if), I think a much better prescription is to cut down on omega 6 rather than load up on omega 3. Omega 3s are anti-inflammatory only because most people&#039;s diets are way too overloaded with omega 6s as a result of our modern industrial diet/food system. Omega 3s just balance out Omega 6s (they work antagonistically), they aren&#039;t really anti-inflammatory in and of themselves. Always better to eat a good diet rather than supplement to make up for a deficiency, in my opinion.]]></description>
