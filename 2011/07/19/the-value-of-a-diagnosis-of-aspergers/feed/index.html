		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s quite inspiring to read how knowledge about Asperger&#039;s has improved this woman&#039;s life. I&#039;m puzzled by your raising it in the context of Angell&#039;s views on psychiatric diagnosis, given that Ms. Carmichael seems to have benefited most from the classification of a set of experiences, abilities, and limitations she has as part of a human &quot;type&quot; that allows her to feel at peace with who she is and organize her life according to what works for her. She has not even been diagnosed by a doctor! This speaks much more to the power of making the ideas and findings of research accessible to the public. An important question is whether that research could be produced without the diagnostic apparatus. Probably not if we mean a system of organizing and classifying phenomena, but that&#039;s not really at issue in the debate.]]></description>
