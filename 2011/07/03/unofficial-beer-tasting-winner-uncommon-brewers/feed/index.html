Posted by Zubon on July 5, 2011 in General and World of Warcraft. 0 Comments     Five or six years ago I went to a sake-tasting event in San Francisco called “The Joy of Sake”. About 140 sakes.

And you still go to tastings??  It seems like ignorance is bliss here, better to preserve your ability to enjoy cheap things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many years ago I decided to buy a fragrance for my wife.  Since at the time we didn&#039;t have much money, we visited several shops where we smelled at least a hundred fragrances on test strips, plus another dozen or so on the skin (for fragrance changes over time as it interacts with the skin).  They all smelled OK, but a few seemed somewhat better than the others. We finally settled upon one.

Over the years, as we subsequently visited fragrance shops, I have noticed how much more sensitive I am to smells.  My wife says, for a typical unappreciated fragrance, that my eyes wince and my face flattens as I shrink back, and I&#039;ll use language to describe it along the lines of, &quot;It&#039;s an army of Brazilian ants marching up towards my sinuses, and each ant swings a machete.&quot;]]></description>
