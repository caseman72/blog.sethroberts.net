		<description><![CDATA[I have a 2 generational example of environment affecting the genetic status. I have enlarged vertebrae in my back - the result of genetic translocation error. My daughter has a gigantic finger - likewise from a translocation error. However, belatedly, we found that we are a family of coeliacs. My own mother developed problems in late age, I was obviously always coeliac (always ill) but not diagnosed till 58. I feel there is a good chance that our poor nutritional systems affected the respective pregnancies. With knowledge and luck, my daughter will not pass on any disability!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cindy, thanks for the informative comment. Watson said similar things many times, in contexts where it was clear he believes that genetic diseases are a big contributor to human disability and disease. Based on comments like his, vast amounts of research money have gone to study &quot;the genetic basis&quot; of this or that big health problem -- even obesity! 

Your particular case is an example of what I am talking about. Perhaps I am mistaken, but based on what you have written, neither you nor anyone you talked to seems have understood that a &quot;genetic&quot; congenital defect in a child may be caused by the child&#039;s mom&#039;s environment, such as her prenatal diet. (I&#039;m not surprised &quot;genetic doctors&quot; would fail to understand it. It would make them less important.) As you may know, there is plenty of evidence that prenatal nutrition can have lifelong effects -- e.g., increasing the rate of heart disease. Perhaps those life-long effects are produced by structural changes in the fetus. Due to genetics, some babies will be more susceptible than others to imperfect prenatal nutrition. You can read about this in a book called Mothers, Babies, and Health in Later Life by D. J. B. Barker. Of course the mom&#039;s nutrition is a thousand or million times easier to modify than the mom&#039;s genes. You might want to consider prenatal-nutrition causality given that you &quot;want [your] progeny to have the option to fix this problem.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps other context was not included in the above quote but I certainly did not take the quote to mean the diseases of civilization (obesity, atherosclerosis, diabetes, etc.) As a mother of a child with a congenital heart defect, I took it to mean congenital defects. As his grandmother has the exact same heart defect but to a lesser degree, we know it&#039;s genetic. He has had two heart surgeries in his life so far and will have more through his life. The treatment for the defect sucks and has cognitive impact. He knows it. We see it. It sucks. 

While researching the genetic cause of the heart defect, we&#039;ve engaged in conversations with genetics doctors who&#039;ve led us to believe that congenital structural defects as well as childhood onset cancers are almost always genetically based (teratogenic agents, notwithstanding.) Parents of children suffering childhood cancers and heart defects know that  the cures, while heroic, have life long cognitive effects that are not cured by environmental factors. Chemotherapy and heart-lung bypass have real excitotoxic impact on the rapidly developing pediatric neurons. It sucks. The irretrievable loss of the child&#039;s full cognitive potential is heart breaking for a parent. The cost of treating or maintaining the life of human with an impactful genetic defect is great.

It has become my goal to discover the genetic defect that causes the heart defect. I want my progeny to have the option to fix this problem. If we can fix the genetic defect but don&#039;t, the child should sue.]]></description>
