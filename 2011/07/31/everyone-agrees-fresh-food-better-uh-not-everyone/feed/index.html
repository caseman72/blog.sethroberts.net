		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
Some of these comments raise an interesting question that you might clarify : does the microbial content need to be alive? As one writer points out, bread is made with yeast, but the yeast would be killed in baking. Also, what about pickles: alive or dead (salt or vinegar)? Finally, what about beer? I&#039;m fond (in moderation, mind you) of Belgian traditional brews, which I believe retain active yeast cultures. On the side of the angels? I will say that when ever I down some sour kraut or yogurt--and I am fond of both--I have you to thank for the feeling having made a good health choice while I enjoy the flavor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, before refridgeration, food was fresh for a little bit, then it was fermented/covered in microbes, whether you wanted it to be or not. 
Meat, fuit, veggies, everything. 

My family leaves (cooked) animal products out overnight without even thinking about it. People from families who don&#039;t do this are afraid of eating a hard boiled egg that&#039;s been out of the fridge for a day. Somthing about stomach pain and vomiting?

Anyways, where are the calls to be less of a baby about food spoilage?]]></description>
