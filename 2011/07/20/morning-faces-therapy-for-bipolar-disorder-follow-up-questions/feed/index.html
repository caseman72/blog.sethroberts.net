		<description><![CDATA[Jeff, my answer to your question is: I doubt it. Whether the glasses will help you sleep I don&#039;t know -- I don&#039;t know enough about you -- but I suspect that the small amount of light they let in isn&#039;t going to make much difference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth or anyone else -

I have a follow up question on blue blocker glasses.  I recently purchased a pair, but there are small gaps at the top and bottom of the glasses that would allow some blue light in.  Is it essential the lenses completely block out all blue light to obtain the sleep benefit?  If so, any suggestions on what to do to correct this problem, hopefully, outside of purchasing a new pair?

TIA]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, one of my subjects had/has a family. It is long face-to-face contact you need to avoid in the evening. The sort of contact you have in a face to face conversation. Seeing faces in other situations won&#039;t have much effect, as far as I can tell. You certainly need to go to bed relatively early (like 10 or 11 pm) and get up relatively early (like 6 pm) for it to work.

However, I think you bring up a good point -- it isn&#039;t easy to avoid face to face contact at night. Perhaps special glasses will be sold that both filter out blue light (which when experience at night can disturb circadian rhythms) and obscure faces.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -

I&#039;ve tried morning faces on several occasions without success.  You previously mentioned that exposure to faces in the evening removes the positive impact of morning faces.  I can&#039;t avoid seeing faces most evenings because I live with someone else.  Have you ever known morning faces to work for people who are not living alone?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried a bunch of alternative treatments for my bi-polar after it seemed clear that psychiatric medications weren&#039;t helping.  When I tried a supplement from Canada for bi-polar, it went away, and I&#039;ve been six years now with no mania, no depression, and no meds.  Of course I don&#039;t know for sure the supplement (emPower Plus from truehope.com) was what did the trick, but the timing makes me think so.  I&#039;ve also never met anyone else who tried that supplement.]]></description>
