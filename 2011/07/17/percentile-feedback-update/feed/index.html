		<description><![CDATA[seth, thanks for the reply. that&#039;s a good thought. i agree it&#039;s probably not a a good idea to put too much stock into it. still, i&#039;m going to continue to play them, mostly because I enjoy them and it seems to help refresh the mind on occasion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, a little off topic here, but I&#039;d be curious to know what you think of &quot;brain training&quot; like Lumosity. I would really like to think I could improve my overall mental performance by playing these games every day, and the software (on-line) offers tracking functions to show if improvement is being made.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your thoughtful reply, Seth.

I agree that a crude measure of output such as # of words written would tend to lower quality, and I was not recommending such a measure.  Since you are monitoring yourself, you are free to try more nuanced and more subjective measures of output than raw word counts (as, for example, when you measure the quality of your sleep).  I don&#039;t know whether you would find such measures as useful as your current measure of efficiency, but they may merit some experiments.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would think that &quot;productivity systems that focus attention on outputs&quot; reward quantity at the expense of quality. For example, how many words you have written at the expense of the quality of those words. They reward efficiency, yes, but I don&#039;t see how they reward creativity. 

One reason I measure time spent (an input) rather than other things (such as outputs) is exactly this issue: to encourage quality over quantity. Maybe I can&#039;t produce much output (= words) but at least I get credit for trying. To answer your question about adverse effects, I haven&#039;t noticed any change in quality. The system has improved my morale since I am more aware of making progress every day and believe I am using my time more productively (in terms of time spent working).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Seth.  I have enjoyed your blog for a while but am a first-time commenter.  Many thanks for all your insights.  (I have especially enjoyed and benefited by your articles on fermented foods.)

Your tracking system seems helpful.  When doing work that requires creativity or deep insight, however (as I&#039;m sure much of your work does), I would be reluctant to use this sort of tracking system for fear of over-emphasizing quantity of work at the expense of quality.  I tend to prefer productivity systems that focus attention on outputs rather than inputs, thereby rewarding efficiency and creativity.

Have you found your tracking system to have any adverse effects on the quality of your work or your morale?  Have you tried tracking other variables that measure your outputs rather than your inputs?]]></description>
