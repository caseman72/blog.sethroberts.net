		<description><![CDATA[In the world of programming, it&#039;s very possible to achieve this effect by side-by-side comparison of two versions of the same code (differently formatted, with different variable namings etc.).

I think it&#039;s actually where the desire for clean and beautiful code comes from.

Probably, I could derive much more pleasure out of programming if I will always code in a side-by-side setup (or at least look at previuos versions often enough).

General purpose text editing tool with a possibility like this would be really great for bloggers and other writers, don&#039;t you think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are two parts (i) a distate for the lesser varieties and (ii) a knowledge about what constitutes a good variety.

For the first part.- Barry Schwartz in &quot;The paradox of choice&quot; popularized an idea that has been tested experimentally many times: when you compare several options side by side, each of the option&#039;s value is decreased. That explains why now for you cheap limoncello fell beyond the level of what you would consider acceptable. 

For the second part.- The fact that now you learned about what makes differences are between different limoncelli, well, would not be possible without comparing them.

All the best,

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure that it requires side-by-side comparisons.  For example, I remember the day I became a real cook.  I used to buy canned chow mein, heat it, and pour it over chow mein noodles which had just come tumbling fresh out of the bag, and we thought that was decent home-cooking.  Then, for some reason that day, I decided to taste supper.  Really taste by focusing on the flavor.  There was an underlying metallic tone, and that&#039;s when I realized that I&#039;d never be able to buy canned chow mein again.  I have repeated this experience multiple times with different foods, and smells, and music.  

What puzzles me is why I start caring about certain categories.  I don&#039;t care about specific plants, for example, although we often visit botanical gardens, and I can easily spend half an hour sniffing roses and irises when they&#039;re in bloom.  But I&#039;ll never write down the names of the plants.

On the other hand, I agree that once you start caring about a particular category, the best way to sharpen your selection criteria is via side-by-side comparisons.  

And for some categories, I can play a game where an uninteresting category becomes interesting for a few hours.  It&#039;s usually when going to some place which interests somebody else and I&#039;m just tagging along.  I ask myself, &#039;What are the 3 most interesting things here?&#039; or &#039;What seems to be the most bizarre thing here?&#039;  or &#039;What did somebody else craft that makes me envious and I wish I had that skill?&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amusement. I use the Willat Effect to test governments. (It&#039;s depressing, I don&#039;t recommend it if you don&#039;t have to.) 

Of course the most important connoisseurship is of things you produce. Everyone should do side-by-side comparisons of parenting, for example.  

I&#039;d like to be a blog connoisseur but it&#039;s hard to find directly comparable blog posts by different people.]]></description>
