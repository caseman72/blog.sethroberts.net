		<description><![CDATA[I guess that ultrasound should remain potentially dangerous until proved safe.

More so when the current technology capabilities and accuracy are rather poor, only adding to the prenatal stress and the mother&#039;s stress (&quot;Madam, there is a 1 in X probability that your child will have XXX). Meanwhile, Michel Odent is a great source of information on pregnancy and birth-giving  http://www.wombecology.com/maternalemotional.html]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Twins are exposed to the same environmental factors even after pregnancy. They are fed the same foods, go out together, live in the same house, even go to pre-school together. The commentator completely ignores this. 

These studies just point to the importance of epigenetics, nothing else.]]></description>
