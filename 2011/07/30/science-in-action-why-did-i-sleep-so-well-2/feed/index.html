		<description><![CDATA[It could be simply a function of increased calories, though I have been trying to eat more lately (more butter too) and haven&#039;t noticed an increase in energy.
I haven&#039;t tried coconut butter at night; I&#039;ve always assumed the MCTs would keep me awake. Good to know.  I could certainly use more energy in the morning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gary Taubes reasoning re coconut butter (which isn&#039;t the same as coconut oil): It worked for him.

one-legged standing: 50%. morning sunlight: 30%. avoid early breakfast: 20%.

I believe a diet high in animal fat can greatly sleep. see my experiments on pork fat and sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, what was Gary Taubes&#039;s reasoning to recommend the coconut fat?

Also, I&#039;m impressed that you can get to almost 99% rested on just over 5 hours of sleep.  I would need 7 hours or more to get anywhere near that level of restfulness.  I know you do one-legged standing, you expose yourself to sunlight in the morning, and you avoid eating until three hours or more after you wake up.  Do you have an estimate for the relative effects of those three strategies?  Also, Is there anything else you would recommend to improve the efficiency of one&#039;s sleep?]]></description>
