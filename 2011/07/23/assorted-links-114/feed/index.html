		<description><![CDATA[I might get a FitBit, but I am less interested in measuring inputs (e.g., amount walked) than outputs (e.g., sleep).

		<description><![CDATA[The intervention bias is interesting to me, because unlike other cognitive biases like confirmation bias, it seems to be deliberate and strategically rather than an unconscious, systematic error in thinking.  I think many decision makers are smart enough to know that often non-intervention is the best course of action, but micro-management pre-emptively deflects the &quot;you didn&#039;t do anything to prevent this!&quot; criticism.  Nixon knew well the consequences of price controls in the 70&#039;s, yet he invoked them anyway for fear of being accused of not &quot;doing anything&quot; to fix the economy.  For this reason I don&#039;t blame the decision makers for erring on the side of over-managing.  They are simply reacting to the ignorance of the general population, who in my opinion are the people who truly lie at the root of the problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Because of refined screening techniques, autism can be diagnosed at younger and younger ages, getting closer and closer to the birth of the child, indicating that whatever is triggering autism must be affecting the child while still in the womb.  

what in the devil is he talking about?  

autism isn&#039;t generally diagnosed until people are several YEARS of age.  

and &quot;advanced screening&quot; is -- what exactly?  


that invalidates his entire argument, as far as i can tell.  which is not to say that he is wrong, necessarily, but that he has NO IDEA what he is talking about.]]></description>
