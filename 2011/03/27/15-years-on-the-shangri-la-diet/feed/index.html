		<description><![CDATA[I start my SLD today
Over a year ago I weighed 85 kilos today I weigh 108 ks a cool 238 lbs.
9 months ago i gave up smoking (40 aday habit) and stopped working from Aid work: 18 warzones and more. 
When I worked in Greece many greeks took 2 tbs of olive oil a day as laxative.
One question light olive boil is labelled &#039;light and mild&#039; I assume its the same as in the US?
Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[I found that my diet really switched around, but that at some point the food I was eating seems to have become too regularized.  I&#039;m now working on changing that.

Though if I go back to rigid eating, my weight drops again.  I&#039;m working out how to get away from rigidly eating a basically flavorless diet and how to deal with eating at restaurants and such on a regular basis.

I&#039;m starting to consider just skipping lunch every day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if the reason why Atkins works (for a while) is that meat without carbohydrates does not create as strong calorie-flavor association as it does with carbs. I personally do like meat, but a meal of only vegetables and meat does not create a genuine craving for me. Whereas high-calorie dinner with a good amount of carbohydrates does. People say it&#039;s great that you can eat all the meat you want with Atkins diet, but I wonder if it is just not as satisfying. 

This could explain why people find that even Atkins diet takes some self-discipline. They still crave for foods that have a lot of carbohydrates. Atkins is still to adhere to than the normal calorie-restriction diet, but it&#039;s not automatic like Shangri-La diet is (when it works). This could also perhaps explain why many people can&#039;t keep with their Atkins diet. (I don&#039;t know the actual numbers, but I&#039;ve understood that lapsing is somewhat of a problem with Atkins too.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t noseclip, but I use a squirt bottle to bounce the oil off the back of my throat.  In Berkeley, the ordinary Barlean&#039;s brand comes in a squirt bottle, which I imagine has the extra advantage of minimizing oxygen exchange, so maintaining freshness.  Of course any brand of oil can be put in a squirt bottle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Kevin. How long have you been doing this

Alex, no, no other suggestions. About noseclipping: I find it much easier to noseclip butter (with a little piece of meat) than ordinary food. I think that is because with ordinary food, noseclipping reduces how enjoyable it is. For example, a noseclipped sandwich is less pleasant than a sandwich eaten normally. Whereas with the butter, all of the pleasure is in the texture (which isn&#039;t just fat, the protein helps). Noseclipping has no effect on that, so the nose-clipped butter is just as pleasant as the butter eaten normally. To be vegan about it, I&#039;d eat the butter on a snap pea or a cracker.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was going to mention to you, and I guess this is as good of a place as any, that I&#039;ve been noseclipping protein shakes in the morning (and rinsing as well. The flavor is very strong and sticks around without rinsing). I wasn&#039;t sure about what kind of results I was getting, hunger-wise, until I, while lying in bed, realized that I could easily list everything I&#039;d eaten that day. I got up, added up the calories, and it was about 1200.  This is an unbelievable reduction, compared to before I started using your advice. I&#039;m very pleased and impressed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, such slow upward trends are very common -- and yours seems to have started at least as early as 2008. I think they are due to strengthening of food-calorie associations -- what most people think of as &quot;food becoming more familiar&quot;. I came across a study that found that the thinner people are at age 20, the slower the weight gain in their 30s and 40s (comparing one culture to another).]]></description>
