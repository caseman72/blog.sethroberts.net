I agree 100%.  

&quot;The root of the issue is the magnitudes involved&quot;

I agree with this too.  It&#039;s amazing how many people there are who think they understand the science but who don&#039;t know that the critical issue is water vapor feedback.

&quot;The expected effect of emissions control, meanwhile, is small.&quot;

I agree with this too, and I would add that the proposals on the table are probably even less effective than they seem, since they are likely to result in some amounts of CO2 emissions simply being shifted from places like the US to places like China.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[withrow and Steve G., it is a fair question, but it&#039;s saddening that you aren&#039;t even aware of the counter-arguments. A good read would be climate-skeptic.com.

The root of the issue is the magnitudes involved. If the effect of more CO2 is small, then there&#039;s no reason to worry. If the effect of emissions control is weak, then it&#039;s a pointless strategy to attempt, and we should look for a better answer.

The expected effect of more CO2 is where there has been especially shoddy science being published. Occam&#039;s Razor suggests that the effect will be small, because the effect is due to the greenhouse effect of CO2 in the atmosphere. We are already past 50% of the maximum possible greenhouse effect due to CO2, so why would we expect having any more than that effect once more, no matter how much CO2 we put out? There are efforts to argue that we approach some sort of tipping point that would cause the a larger effect from later amounts of CO2 than earlier amounts. There&#039;s not much evidence for any such effect that is also consistent with the Earth&#039;s history as we know it. In particular, we&#039;ve had high CO2 in the past without seeing any sort of tipping point, so why should it be different in the modern era?

The expected effect of emissions control, meanwhile, is small. To really stop CO2 levels from growing, cutting emissions by half is not enough. The cuts have to be more like 80-90% world-wide. Such cuts would have severe negative impact on human quality of life, so no such proposals are being floated. However, if the cuts are anything less -- or if, like Kyoto, they don&#039;t even reduce emissions at all -- then CO2 levels will keep rising. In that case, the emissions control just delays our doom instead of preventing it, and we still need an alternate solution eventually.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;There is no contradiction&quot;

The question is not whether it&#039;s a contradiction.  The question is whether it is dishonest for people like Gavin Schmidt to pretend that they are not advocates when in reality they are.

If these warmist researchers came right out and admitted that they are advocates; that they will do their best to put the best possible spin on things in order to support their position; that they will attempt to prevent dissenters from having their work published; that they feel justified in inventing excuses to dodge freedom of information requests in order to shield their work from scrutiny; etc.; then I would have much less of a problem with them.  (Of course, I would oppose public funding for such individuals.)

&quot;Most of your questions are already answered in my previous posting&quot;

Nonsense, and the fact that you are unable to concede points which are clear to any reasonable person underscores the whole problem with the warmist side of the debate.  

These are people who (apparently) feel perfectly justified in attempting to silence dissent; withholding data; and in general spinning things to put their pre-determined view of reality in the best possible light.  Meanwhile, they have not offered hard objective evidence that their climate simulations are correct, such as bona fide, interesting, accurate predictions.  Instead, we are simply supposed to trust them.  But their behavior shows that they cannot be trusted.]]></description>

reality.  There is no contradiction, but they do make conflicting demands on one&#039;s time -- along with family and other needs.  Each of us is obliged to sort out those demands as well as we can.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;There are honest and dishonest ways to advocate a point of view. The former is what Gavin Schmidt is doing&quot;

That&#039;s simply not true.  Here&#039;s an (apparent) quote from him:

______________

&quot;Climate scientists are paid to do climate science,â€ said Gavin A. Schmidt, a senior climatologist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€™s Goddard Institute of Space Studies. â€œTheir job is not persuading the public.&quot;

_________________

A reasonable person reading this would understand that Gavin Schmidt is attempting to pass himself off as being disinterested; neutral; NOT an advocate with a position.

&quot;It doesnâ€™t matter who, if anybody, tried to prevent publication.&quot;

Why are you evading my question?  It&#039;s not a trick question.  It doesn&#039;t have any hidden assumptions in it.  Yes or no, please.

&quot;They did not &#039;attempt to game the system&#039;; they discussed possible actions that they decided against.&quot;

Again, this is simply not true.  Here is one of the Climategate e-mails:

&quot;I had some emails with him [McIntyre] a few years ago when he wanted to get all the station temperature data we use here in Climatic Research Unit. At that time, I hid behind the fact that some of the data had been received from individuals and not directly from Met(eorological) Services through the Global Tele-communications Service (GTS) or through the Global Climate Observing System&quot;

Clearly the e-mail author (Phil Jones) was attempting to invent excuses to avoid disclosing information to a perceived adversary.  

&quot;All productive researchers are obliged to engage in variations of &#039;this sort of behavior&#039;&quot;

Researchers are obliged to invent excuses to avoid complying with freedom of information requests?

Anyway, it&#039;s not a waste of time for a researcher to turn his data over to a hostile adversary.  The adversary might find something wrong with the researcher&#039;s data, methods, or results.  This is a valuable and productive result.

Besides, if it was really about saving time, the climategate folks would not have objected to the release of the climategate e-mails.  Instead, they would have said something like this:

&quot;We want to thank whoever leaked this information.  We really wanted to do it ourselves, but we did not have the 3 or 4 minutes required to burn all the e-mails to a DVD and drop them in the mail.  Thank you for saving us 3 or 4 minutes!!&quot;

And again:  

In your view, what is the most compelling example of climate simulations making accurate, bona fide, interesting predictions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(1) There are honest and dishonest ways to advocate a point of view.  The former is what Gavin Schmidt is doing. Promoting transparently phony &quot;climategate&quot; scandals is the latter. Being seen to engage in the latter reveals true intentions. 

(2) It doesn&#039;t matter who, if anybody, tried to prevent publication.  My opinion about what they meant to do matters even less. If they had tried to prevent publication of real work, they would fail. If the shills did real work, they wouldn&#039;t be shills. Much of the apparatus of science is geared to preventing publication of substandard and deliberately misleading works (although it often fails), and it&#039;s part of every scientist&#039;s job to help. 

(3) They did not &quot;attempt to game the system&quot;; they discussed possible actions that they decided against.  All &lt;i&gt;productive&lt;/i&gt; researchers are obliged to engage in variations of &quot;this sort of behavior&quot;, if by that you mean putting off time-wasting [censored] whenever and as long as possible.  I applaud all such efforts, because I want scientists to do science.  I &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; that not everybody wants that.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; All researchers are advocates of a point of view&quot;

I basically agree, which is why it is troubling when people like Gavin Schmidt pretend that they are not advocates.

&quot;Nobody can prevent publication.&quot;

Does this mean yes or no?  Are claiming that none of the researchers in question attempted to prevent publication of any article?

&quot;All productive researchers use every imaginable trick (oops! thereâ€™s that word) to keep [censored] from wasting their time.&quot;

So it sounds like you are saying that (1) yes, one or more of the researchers in question attempted to game the system to prevent their perceived adversaries from getting information through freedom of information requests; (2) they did it primarily to save time and not to prevent scrutiny of their work; and (3) all researchers engage in this sort of behavior.

Do I understand you correctly?

Oh, and in your view, what is the most compelling example of climate simulations making accurate, bona fide, interesting predictions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read the e-mails.  I also read the code, and the comments in the code.  The &quot;hide the decline&quot; and &quot;Mike&#039;s trick&quot; comments have been examined thoroughly by several independent commissions, and have been found to have absolutely innocuous implications.  Everyone who cares has seen detailed demonstrations of this.  

Paraphrasing Seth, again, when the very smokingest gun they can come up with turns out to be a trick cigarette lighter, there&#039;s no point in looking further.

The &#8220;hide the decline&#8221; and &#8220;Mike&#8217;s trick&#8221; comments have been examined thoroughly by several independent commissions, and have been found to have absolutely innocuous implications.  Everyone who cares has seen detailed demonstrations of this.  </p>
<p>Paraphrasing Seth, again, when the very smokingest gun they can come up with turns out to be a trick cigarette lighter, there&#8217;s no point in looking further.  This is not only because other offerings will be even weaker. It is also because it reveals that they are trying to deceive you, so all further efforts will be to that end.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Sean: Your observation is painfully obvious, but backwards:  The sole reason for the &quot;controversy&quot; over global warming is that the honestly expressed implications of the research results demand public policy changes that would (&quot;inconveniently&quot;) interrupt extraction of rent on long-held properties.

Sabril: Seth has expressed, again and again, that he&#039;s &lt;i&gt;really not interested&lt;/i&gt; in looking at evidence.  The dance is a two-step.  The first step is that the only evidence worth looking at is global temperature predicted &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the present.  The second step is that the only prediction to take seriously is one that does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; forecast a temperature rise.  The first means that there will never be a time to examine results of predictions.  The second means that having predicted &lt;i&gt;correctly&lt;/i&gt; automatically disqualifies a model as trivial.

In response to your three points:

 (1) All researchers are advocates of a point of view.  Some lie and say they aren&#039;t.  If they express a foolish point of view, legions of other researchers are eager to jump down their throats. When many scientists expose their point of view, it means no serious criticism remains to be demolished. 

(2) Nobody can prevent publication.  The shills in question were handicapped mainly by &lt;i&gt;never having done&lt;/i&gt; any &lt;i&gt;research of their own&lt;/i&gt;.  

(3) All productive researchers use every imaginable trick (oops! there&#039;s that word) to keep [censored] from wasting their time.  For each minute of each day, a whole crowd of [censored] lies in wait to make off with it.  Scientists not harassed by {censored] are often doing nothing interesting. (Scott Adams&#039;s first book was about this, titled, &quot;Always Postpone Meetings with Time-wasting Morons&quot;.)

Steve G: Natural selection has recently been made predictive, and has been replicated in labs all over the world.  As pointed out earlier, &quot;prediction&quot; needn&#039;t refer to linear time.  Paleontologists routinely make predictions about what a complete specimen (that died millions of years before their birth) will be found to reveal, and are roundly ridiculed when they predict wrong -- just as in other disciplines.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tierney, Muller&#039;s talk makes clear what a big difference it makes to &quot;hide the decline&quot;, also known as &quot;Mike&#039;s trick&quot;. I had not seen that pointed out before. When you &quot;hide the decline&quot; (which is shorthand for several changes) the graph that you get (which is what was published) becomes far more favorable to the case that Mann and his colleagues were pushing.

		<description><![CDATA[I like Withrow&#039;s point, at least it describes how I come to this issue. We have a strong reason to believe points 1 &amp; 2, so what do we do now? I agree that models are likely imperfect, and that future testing would be ideal, but we have to decide whether to cross the Rubicon now. And not to choose is to choose. (Sorry, it seems like a stream of cliches, but I hope it gets across my point.) In other words, we can&#039;t wait for perfection, we can&#039;t wait 20, 50, or 100 years to check out &quot;who was right&quot;. Indeed, scientifically, isn&#039;t looking into the future much like looking into the past to judge, for instance, evolution? We can&#039;t test evolution by its predictive power, we can&#039;t replicate it in a lab, but we believe it. (I do.) Isn&#039;t the theory of evolution explanatory but not predictive?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seth, people are always pointing you to compelling predictions and proofs. &quot;

I realize that this comment is not addressed to me, but I really would like to see an example where these climate simulations were tested by successfully making bona fide interesting predictions.

Let&#039;s do it this way:  In your view, what is the most compelling example of climate simulations making accurate, bona fide, interesting predictions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This debate is interesting in that the climate change side is firmly convinced that anthropogenic warming is a threat, the denialists side is adamant it&#039;s not, and both sides accuse the other of bias.  Very few people rest in the middle, which makes this issue almost a matter of politics rather than science, much like Republicans vs Liberals.  If you&#039;re an environmentalist you&#039;re probably going to be on the anthropogenic warming side, and if you&#039;re a free market advocate, probably a denier.  Has anybody else noticed this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there are three parts of the Global Warming argument to contend with.

1) Are there more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than in centuries past?  I&#039;m not an expert in the field, but the experts seem to be saying that&#039;s true and I haven&#039;t seen any disagreement on that point to speak of.  Maybe there is some controversy on this point, but I haven&#039;t seen it.

2) Assuming you except #1, we can ask: are human behaviors contributing to the increase in greenhouse gases?  Again, the link between our collective carbon footprint and the evidence of more greenhouse gases seems to be fairly well-accepted.

Ok, if you sign on to those two points, I think you basically have to acknowledge that humans are changing the world in a way that could be dangerous.  In other words, we&#039;re polluting Earth to the detriment of future generations.

It would be nice to believe that the climate models (argument #3 in the Global Warming debate) are going to be accurate so that we could quantify how much in resources we should spend to reduce our carbon footprint.  But, like Seth, I&#039;m skeptical of their accuracy.  I&#039;ve spent a fair amount of time watching the models of how we might expect baseball players to perform from one year to the next and that took some time to get right-- and it seems much, much easier to predict baseball players&#039; correctly than to shape an accurate climate model.  So, I&#039;m skeptical about these models&#039; accuracy.

Here&#039;s the thing, though.  If you&#039;re skeptical about their accuracy and you basically accept #1 and #2, I think you pretty much have to admit that the climate models could be underestimating the change.  That is, our best scientists, for all we know, could be wildly underpredicting the impact of our carbon footprint.  

It makes sense to me to use the best science we have to estimate the resources we should spend to correct this situation before future generations suffer from our polluting ways.]]></description>

Seth, people are always pointing you to compelling predictions and proofs.
