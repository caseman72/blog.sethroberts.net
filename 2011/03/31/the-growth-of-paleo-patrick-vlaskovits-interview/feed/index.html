		<description><![CDATA[I wonder how much of the growth is due to Gary Taubes, in a roundabout way? That&#039;s how I got to Paleohacks, at any rate. Gary Taubes convinced me that eating fat was good, I started reading more about nutrition, then I started eating less carb and more fat, which led me to a number of paleo blogs (PaNu &amp; the like) and not-really-paleo-but-close blogs (Whole Health Source &amp; the like), eventually I found Paleohacks.

I don&#039;t eat a true paleo diet, BTW, but find the Paleohacks site very helpful for a whole range of food-related issues from sourcing healthy food to nutrition to cooking. And I love the way the site is set up.]]></description>
