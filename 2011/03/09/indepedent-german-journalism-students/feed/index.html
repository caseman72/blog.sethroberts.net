		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I did not encounter these problems (lack of work ethic, lack of curiosity). Every one of my students had something they wanted to learn about. As for subjects &quot;important to know&quot; but not appealing, in psychology statistics is one of those subjects. I think the problem is professors wanting to appear scientific. At Berkeley, at least, few psychology majors want to do research. They go on to law school, become high school teachers, and so on. Statistics isn&#039;t actually important for them to know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The system described in the blog post seems like it would work well for highly motivated, inquisitive students.  But what about students who perhaps lack a strong work ethic and a sense of curiosity?  And what about subjects that may be important to know but may not appeal to otherwise-inspired students?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the main idea behind the experimental liberal arts college I attended, New College of Florida. Control over coursework leads to flourishing. Three main features facilitate this. 

1. There are no grades; classes are pass/fail and students receive narrative evaluations form their professors. This lets students decide for themselves when to put forth their best efforts (no bad grades for bad or uninteresting classes).

2. Students can design their own classes if a professor agrees to sponsor.

3. Passing criteria is determined by a contract each semester that students agree to after designing it with their sponsor. E.g., passing 3/3 hard classes, passing 4/4 or 5 moderately hard classes, or passing 4/7 if the student wants breadth that semester.

The format can be taken advantage of. When it works, however, there is nothing like it. And, like me, many of my fellow alumni report being better prepared for graduate work than many of their grad school peers.]]></description>
