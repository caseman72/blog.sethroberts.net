		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if part of the problem is that most people are not sophisticated and disciplined enough to accurately measure their own blood pressure once or twice a day in order to really nail down the effects the medication is having on them.

If a doctor instructs all of his patients to self-evaluate in this way, he can be sure that a large percentage will not do it properly.  If somebody screws up and is hurt as a result, would the doctor be open to charges of malpractice?  If the doctor tries to pick out who is likely to comply, will he be open to charges of racism or classism?

		<description><![CDATA[dearieme, that&#039;s a good point. so there were three things wrong here. 1. no medicine needed. 2. medicine didn&#039;t work. 3. doctor didn&#039;t care whether medicine worked.
