		<description><![CDATA[Joseph, the roast pork I eat is roasted by others.

About your idea that eating enough of a sufficiently fatty animal supplies all necessary nutrients: That doesn&#039;t explain why we like sweet things so much (except when we&#039;re hungry). In spite of what Tomas says, meat isn&#039;t significantly sweet. (One indication of this: Koreans marinate meat in a sauce that contains sugar.) And I&#039;m sure we need plenty of microbes, which fresh meat doesn&#039;t supply.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anyway I&#039;m almost always eating meat packed the same day. I don&#039;t exactly cook it rare, as in still pink, but I don&#039;t char it either... just quit when the ground beef changes color or the fish gets soft. So there&#039;s no overcooking. 

So I&#039;m probably getting a lot of Vit C... If you can trust the Chinese on meat freshness at MNC supermarkets. Which I think you can, ironically enough... meat freshness is something they&#039;re culturally very particular about, and as far as I know they don&#039;t employ the chemical treatment techniques designed to make meat look fresher longer used in the US.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, are you buying the roast pork already cooked or cooking it yourself?

Plus you&#039;re in Beijing... which is a pretty tough environment on the lips anyway.

It&#039;s pretty much an article of faith for me at this point that eating the meat of any animal sufficiently large &amp; fatty monotonically supplies all nutrients necessary for life, if not the optimal balance. 

I tried butter in a tiny quantity by the way, and it obliterated me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Preference for sweetness is equivalent to preference for ripeness, in fruit.  The learned association between sweetness and color makes this a very adaptive trait, because climbing a tree after fruit must be worth the risk.

Plants convert starches to sugar in ripe fruit when the seed is viable and, perhaps, some environmental condition favoring germination is satisfied.  This also is very adaptive, within the environment of animals that have been trained to recognize the ripeness they are encouraged, by the sweetness, to prefer.  Co-evolution.

I don&#039;t know of any specific nutrient that may be in fruit that counters chapped lips.  But then, I don&#039;t believe we have identified every important substance we get from food.  It certainly seems plausible that people who indulge in unusual diets (as defined by American custom of the mid 20th century), &quot;unusual&quot; activities (e.g. smoking, pregnancy, childhood, grave injuries, infections, starvation), or (particularly!) normal genetic variation seem likely to require substances not  readily noted in lab testing, or much larger amounts of certain familiar substances.  It has been suggested that autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy are sometimes examples of such cases. I understand that some (of the terrifying variety of) mitochondrial genetic illnesses are known examples.  Any drug that must be consumed daily to maintain normal health may be counted as such a substance.  Just as several drugs may treat one condition, a variety of carotenes satisfy our need for vitamin A.  The only difference, really, is how widespread the need is.

Our need for vitamin C started as an example of normal genetic variation, and is now universal among primates, making it a proper vitamin. Including the rest of Mammalia in the population preserves its status as &quot;needed for certain genetic variations&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, do you have any specific nutrient in mind? Lack of Vitamin C unquestionably causes connective-tissue problems. Paul had bad gums, for example. With other necessary nutrients, such as magnesium, sodium, and many others, a connection with connective-tissue problems isn&#039;t clear.

Is there a universal human preference for sweetness? Well, very young babies like sweet things. Long before they could have been taught to like them. In children, the conventional explanation for sweetness preference (sweet foods are a source of calories) makes sense. They haven&#039;t yet learned flavor-calorie associations that make food (containing calories) taste better than non-food (without calories), so a preference for sweetness helps them (because sweet things do usually have calories--extractable energy).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But don&#039;t eat the wobbly bits.

It seems to me this is really jumping to conclusions.  Yes, we need vitamin C, but we need lots of other things too.  Maybe the chapped lips were the result of some other deficiency, and the actual fruit countered the other deficiency.  Fruits are made of a lot of compounds other than vitamin C.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I also wonder how a human living here (in the Pacific Northwest) would get his or her vitamin c before agriculture and the advent of shipping foods around the country. Like Native Americans. We can&#039;t grow citrus fruits up here, and I don&#039;t thing peppers grow naturally, either. I&#039;ve heard that pine needles have a lot of vitamin c, but I can&#039;t imagine they&#039;re very agreeable?

So what flavors would a tribe living here in Washington have to be attracted to in order to get their vitamin C?

As for the evolutionary preference for sweetness, do you know for sure that there is a universal human preference for sweetness? Are there always sweet dishes in the pre-westernized cultures of the world? I&#039;m not saying there aren&#039;t, and you may know more about it than I do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kevin and others who have brought up the point that certain non-fruits are high in Vitamin C, I am wondering what you conclude from that about the evolutionary reason for our preference for sweetness. How would you explain our preference for sweetness? 

Look at the same thing in a different domain: our preference for sour foods. It&#039;s strong and obvious, just like our preference for sweet foods. Lemons are sour. Does that mean we like sour things so that we will eat more lemons? Probably not because there is a bigger picture to consider. A much wider range of facts supports the idea that we like sour foods (such as yogurt) because we require plenty of microbes in our diet to be healthy. Microbes often make food sour.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been trying to think of this all day, and I just remembered.

Some peppers have a lot lot (lot) more vitamin C than oranges. Hot green chillis have about more than three times the vitamin C of navel oranges, per weight.

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas, you disagree that &quot;we naturally won&#039;t eat sweets when we are hungry.&quot; There have been a bunch of studies showing that hunger reduces preferences for sweets, done I think by Elizabeth Capaldi. An article about this phenomenon mentioned among other things that in the Nazi concentration camps, where people were starving, a candy bar had zero barter value. Perhaps children are different than adults, I don&#039;t know.

Tomas, that&#039;s an interesting point. Greater-than-usual desire for this or that food generally signals a nutritional deficiency, yes, as far as I know. Do you know what deficiencies causes greater-than-usual desire for sweetness?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can someone here explain to me why humans, unlike a lot of animals, don&#039;t create their own vitamin C endogenously?

&gt;

I don&#039;t agree with this.  It doesn&#039;t fit with my experience, and I suspect it is a cultural phenomenon.  Most of us were told as youngsters that we had to eat our dinner first if we wanted a sweet.  The idea was that we WOULD eat the sweet first, if we could, and that might destroy our appetite so that we wouldn&#039;t eat the other nutritious food.]]></description>
