		<description><![CDATA[This is in contrast to the US media news reports:

First 10 minutes: murders, rapes, fires, political scandals, regional weather that could turn dangerous, schools losing their funding, increasing homeless populations, teens doing too many drugs.

Final: a few football and basketball scores.

It&#039;s no surprise that hypertension and depression are on the rise in the US.]]></description>
