		<description><![CDATA[On the idea of fancy restaurants being Veblen goods, I&#039;ve thought this may also partly explain why so many expensive foods/drinks are acquired tastes.  Very few people enjoy the taste of fine scotch, or moldy cheeses on the first try - most people I&#039;ve seen trying straight whiskey for the first time make a face of disgust.  The ability to consume such products without grimacing shows that you can afford to routinely indulge in such expensive pleasures.  Of course, anyone could learn to enjoy scotch by drinking cheap whiskey, but such a person wouldn&#039;t learn the language used to describe scotch, and could still be readily identified.  Were these goods cheaper so that anyone could afford to acquire the taste, perhaps many less would bother.]]></description>
