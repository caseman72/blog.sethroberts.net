		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of Bradley Smith&#039;s comment about &quot;The irrational vocabulary of the American professorial class&quot; and that when the chips are down they always support the state. There are a few notable exceptions, Butz, Rushdon, Ellis, Brand, MacDonald, all of them persecuted to some degree, but generally speaking most professors are spineless kids who&#039;ll join in the persecution at the drop of a hat..
Academic freedom means the state has the professors by the balls, and it doesn&#039;t take much squeezing to get them to fall in line.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas, the rest of the post is a &quot;tolerant&quot; version of the first paragraph. If that strikes you as too long, then just take the story about Bailey&#039;s class. I could have stated my disapproval of those who suppress Holocaust deniers by telling that story.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I am not entirely sure I understand why you say that your first paragraph is an instance of &quot;intolerance&quot;.  Could you elucidate that and perhaps rewrite how you would have written the paragraph in a more &quot;tolerant&quot; fashion?]]></description>
