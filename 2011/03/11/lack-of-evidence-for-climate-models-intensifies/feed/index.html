Should be easy enough for him if there really are mountains of it.

But probably it&#039;s just hot air with not a single fact behind them. Sadly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[drewski, thanks for a new example of my point -- that the supporters of the models make the best arguments &lt;strong&gt;against &lt;/strong&gt;them (unwittingly). You mention &quot;the mountain of evidence&quot; &lt;strong&gt;and &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;increasingly accurate predictions&quot;. The only evidence that matters is accurate predictions (not &quot;increasingly accurate&quot;). Your statement implies that as far as you know, accurate predictions are rare or non-existent. Because you seem to know more about this than I do, coming from you such a statement is more persuasive than when it comes from me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well 99% of people will go along with the dominant view.  Richard Feynman was a unique man - brilliant and absolutely unafraid to disagree with anyone.  If God himself had spoken to Feynman, Feynman would not have been afraid to contradict Him.

They say that during the Manhattan project, Oppenheimer preferred to discuss ideas with Feynman because Feynman was not afraid to contradict his superiors.

Anyway, part of the problem is the way that people become scientists.  I suppose you would know more about this than me, but I think that to make it through graduate school, post-docs, the tenure process, get funding, get published, etc., arguably the most important thing is to please the people above you.   Particularly if you are not brilliant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; I wouldnâ€™t/donâ€™t expect any climate researcher to &#039;condemn&#039; Hansen because it would be a terrible career move&quot;

Probably so, but the fact that even tenured professors are reluctant to publicly call out Hansen for his shenanigans doesn&#039;t say much for climate science as a field.

It&#039;s really a shame that Richard Feynman isn&#039;t around anymore.  He would have had no problem calling BS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nile, I don&#039;t think the models go back that far.

Sabril, you make a good point about Hansen. The saying is: lie down with dogs, wake up with fleas. I wouldn&#039;t/don&#039;t expect any climate researcher to &quot;condemn&quot; Hansen because it would be a terrible career move. But I wonder if letting his extremism (absurd faith in his models) go unpunished encouraged other extremism, such as Michael Mann&#039;s. The whole profession wakes up with fleas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I live in Minnesota, USA.  12,000 years ago the land where my house stands was under a half mile thick ice sheet.   There must have been extreme global warming to melt that much ice.  Did/do the models predict that outcome?  Can the climate change believers explain what cause the last ice age to end?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree 100%, but I would add two points:

First, you don&#039;t even have to note the lack of accurate predictions to be skeptical of these climate simulations.  Because climatologists don&#039;t understand things like what caused the Little Ice Age or what caused global surface temperatures to rise from 1890 to 1950.  If there are important mechanisms which (1) are capable of significantly changing global surface temperatures; and (2) are not understood, then it&#039;s obviously an extremely difficult task to model and predict global surface temperatures.

Second, your example illustrates the warmist mentality.  The fact that most warmist researchers have not condemned Hansen is further evidence that they have a war mentality about this controversy.  That they cannot be trusted to play fair.]]></description>
