		<description><![CDATA[Doesn&#039;t high-degree cooking destroy the beneficial organisms in miso?  For health benefits I *believe* you should add the miso at the end when you take the soup off of the stove.  For that reason, I would think eating soup from a buffet or restaurant where the miso is kept hot all the time would not be beneficial.  A lot of the miso here in the United States is pasteurized which, I would think, would destroy many of the benefits.

I am not sure about the above, so if anybody would like to correct me, please do so.]]></description>

Seems like you can get a comparable amount of radiation from living in a stone, brick, or concrete building vs. living in high-altitude areas with high background radiation.]]></description>
