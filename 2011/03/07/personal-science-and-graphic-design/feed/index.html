		<description><![CDATA[Seth, this reminded me of a question I&#039;ve had for a while. Have you done some other experiments to see what about the butter is having the effect? Have you tried heavy cream instead, since butter is made from cream? What about clarified butter (ghee)?

How about other types of fats? I know you were on the pork belly kick for a while, but what about comparing beef fat, or chicken fat?

Just curious.]]></description>
