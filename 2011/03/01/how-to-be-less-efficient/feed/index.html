		<description><![CDATA[Justin, no I have made no discoveries. I&#039;ve been collecting the data for about a month but have yet to start to analyze it. I&#039;ve tried this in the past; this time I hope I have a better system. I think it takes a long time just to start to be consistent in the data collection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I am curious if you have made any discoveries (or have any hypotheses) related to your working or not data.

In the spreadsheet I fill out every night, I estimate how much time I spent across 13 categories. One of the categories is &quot;totally useless time&quot; and from that I have a &quot;% time not unproductive&quot; variable. I have found that since I started measuring these timing categories, I have looked for areas of &quot;productive&quot; overlap to get that percentage lower, such as reading outside, or working out while I listen to a podcast.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m attempting to debunk something.

I work when I feel like it.

As a child, my authorities told me that this would result in no work. I doubted - it seemed to me it only resulted in no pointless work.

I&#039;m winning so far. Some hurdles still to study, I don&#039;t yet know what all of them actually require to overcome. But - if we&#039;re measuring intellectual output one of the hurdles is for me to figure out how to reliably stop working once I&#039;ve started. I keep staying up way too late. Also my body starts to complain at thirteen hours straight...for some reason...

In a sense, it&#039;s less efficient. For example, right now I&#039;m commenting on your blog. In another sense, it&#039;s infinitely more efficient. I never work in the sense of using self-discipline, but am productive anyway. 

The main hurdle for me is an HBD issue. So...I don&#039;t require self-discipline to do &#039;chores.&#039; Either a great deal of suffering is entirely unnecessary, or I&#039;m one special snowflake.

I think I like these options.]]></description>
