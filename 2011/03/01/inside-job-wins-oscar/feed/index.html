		<description><![CDATA[People measure demand schedules for Coldplay CDs continuously.  Wal-mart fiddles with prices at different stores, and measures with frightening precision empirical demand schedules for thousands of commodities.  No, they don&#039;t exactly follow the curves microeconomists use to simplify their theories, and the demand for each commodity is far from independent of the prices of various others, but it doesn&#039;t matter very much, except, of course, to retailers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glen, my friend&#039;s class was before the rise of behavioral economics, the whole premise of which is that ideas about &quot;what people will do&quot; should be tested, not assumed. The rise of that field supports my view (that economists didn&#039;t care enough about data), I think. From my point of view, behavioral economists are mediocre data collectors. This is no surprise, since they are just starting, whereas experimental psychologists have a hundred years of practice. Behavioral economic experiments are usually just one step better than demonstrations -- they are pretty good for showing whatever idea they started with is right (which is a lot better than not collecting any data), but poorly designed for uncovering new ideas. John List&#039;s work on the ultimatum experiment reveals the low average level of experimental technique. That&#039;s what I mean when I say economists have a long way to go.

An intro physics class that didn&#039;t spend at least half the time discussing data would be pretty bad. It should cover how data is collected, how data leads to theory, how data tests theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Much of micro is practically self-evident if correctly explained, but doing so includes keeping a lot of nuance that it sounds like was lost in translation here. It&#039;s more like &quot;if this happens, people will *tend to* do such and such, on average, all else being equal, assuming simple motives&quot;. The underlying principles that lead to those rules get tested a little every time a store has a &quot;sale&quot; and sells more than they did at the old price. Every time the government sets a price control and causes shortages or subsidizes something and causes surpluses. Every time somebody prices something too high and it doesn&#039;t sell.

Sometimes simplifying abstraction is appropriate. If your student took introductory physics, would you ask &quot;where&#039;s the data?&quot; when working out assertions about what would happen when a perfectly spherical billiard ball on a perfectly frictionless table hits another with twice the mass in a perfectly elastic collision? Econ 101 is mostly about the *predictable* components of human action, just as Physics 101 is mostly about the *predictable* components of physical action.]]></description>
