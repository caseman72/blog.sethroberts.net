		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t find the reference now, so take this with appropriate grains of salt.

I recall reading a couple of years ago that a team of researchers had discovered a gene that coded for something that gave people substantial protection against asthma. Almost all humans had this gene, but it was not active. What activated it was exposure to hepatitis. (I&#039;m pretty sure it was Hep-A, but might have been B. Certain it wasn&#039;t C.) (Please note carefully: &#039;exposure to&#039;, which is not the same as &#039;having active disease&#039;.)

The epidemiology is plausible because most human populations in the past had substantial exposure to Hep-A, as demonstrated by presence of antibodies. Currently, several populations do not - and those have high incidences of asthma.

I would guess that this fits quite well with the data points cited here. I would expect higher exposure rates on farms.]]></description>
