		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If I stood 9 hours or more, I woke up feeling incredibly rested. Yet to get any improvement I had to stand at least 8 hours. That wasn’t easy, and after about 9 hours of standing my feet would start to hurt. I stopped standing that much. It was fascinating but not practical.&quot;

In the light of recent news [1], it seems one has to actually stand (or at least not sit) for at least 8 hours a day, preferably even more. :-)

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your reply Seth.
It is hard for me to understand: I don&#039;t know what you mean by &quot;think of me as rating the amount of a substance that makes me feel tired.&quot; Substance?
My current expectation/belief is that most people would probably struggle to rate their perception of their own restedness on a 1-20 scale to the nearest whole number (ie., to within approx 5%) with much confidence, let alone to within fractions of 1 percent.
Regards.

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: Suppose someone asked you to estimate how many grains of flaxseed were on a plate. Suppose the number could range from 0-1000. You can look at the plate for only a few seconds. For convenience, you decide to give your estimates as percentages 0-100%. When the number of flaxseeds is very small (e.g., 6), you will be able to make remarkably precise estimates (e.g., 0.6%). With larger numbers, your estimates will be less precise. The point: when you are at the edge of a scale, estimates can be more precise than at the middle of the scale.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article, thanks. But do I understand your first chart correctly? It appears to display that how rested you felt on awakening varied over a VERY VERY narrow range of between approximately 98.7% and 99.5% ?!! This suggests you were rating how rested you felt on your 0%-100% scale to small fractions of 1 percent. Surely the numbers along the x-axis of the chart must be wrong? Thanks!

&lt;strong&gt;Seth: The x axis is correct. The ratings are very close to the edge of the scale (100%). Thus the precision. If this is hard to understand, think of me as rating the amount of a substance that makes me feel tired. When there is none of it, the restedness rating is 100%.&lt;/strong&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A really interesting device you might want to try to find is called a Sleep Timer made by the author of &quot;No More Sleepless Nights&quot; Murray Jarman. It&#039;s basically a little timer that you have to squeeze to keep it from starting itself. Once the person falls asleep they no longer squeeze the trigger on the Sleep Timer. The idea is to measure &quot;sleep latency&quot; or the amount of time it takes to fall asleep. The author presents a scientific approach to finding the best way for the individual to fall asleep fast. 

However, this may or may not be the best way to judge sleep quality. Maybe neither is the &quot;first sleep&quot; idea. 

What do you think is the best way to measure sleep quality? Perhaps number of times awaken in the night? REM cycles?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps I&#039;m just being foggy brained (not rested enough this morning?), but I&#039;m not sure I understand your counting. 

When you say &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot; -- is that two times standing on one leg to exhaustion, or two times on each leg. That is, left leg to exhaustion followed by right leg to exhaustion -- is that one, or two?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris, when I first started standing a lot (like 8 hr/day) I was enormously tired the first few evenings. But after a week or so that went away and the benefits persisted. By the time I started one-legged standing I already stood a lot. The one-legged standing caused no fatigue in the evenings. I think there is just an introductory period you need to get through.

vic, I rarely eat after 8 pm. I agree, bad idea to eat near bedtime.]]></description>
