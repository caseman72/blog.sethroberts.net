		<description><![CDATA[&quot;why does Minnesota have such high autism rates?&quot;

Perhaps because of its latitude and corresponding low average levels of vitamin D.

		<description><![CDATA[In response to UncleLongHair, I totally agree that correlation and coincidence do not prove causation.  For example, if one looks at a long list of facts concerning the assassination of President Lincoln and President Kennedy, one can find lots of correlations.  All that proves is that if you look at enough random facts about any two events, you will find interesting coincidences.  I am not claiming that there is difinitive proof that PFCs cause autism. In science, we view a phenomenon and then postulate about possible causes. We then determine ways to test our hypotheses. The &quot;proof&quot; of any hypothesis comes when we can use that hypothesis to make predictions and those predictions prove to be true. As for Sabri&#039;s comment, there are many autism &quot;clusters&quot; that have nothing to do with political boundaries, but might be explained by different types of PFC exposure senarios . As Seth points out, the rise in autism rates over time must be explained. 

I appreciate Seth&#039;s patience to explain things. For myself, I am just looking for a few highly qualified, careful and objective individuals that can tackle the difficult job of studing the toxocology of PFCs, and who can do the epidemiologic studies.  I hope no one &quot;knows&quot; that PFCs cause autism because some geologist thinks so.  I understand contaminant fate, transport and human exposure.  I leave the real toxicology and epidemiology to the experts.  

Fortunately, I have already run across some experts since I wrote to Seth that are interested in the subject, and one epidemiologist who was actually beginning to look at the possible link between PFCs and Aspergers.  A public debate at this time is folly without hard science.  However, the stakes are incredibly high and we need to find the cause or causes of these diseases as fast as possible.  Pointing in one possible direction of a cause is not the same as faking data as happened in the case of the vacination hypothesis.

Sabril&#039;s comment, although not taking into account multiple lines of evidence, is still useful as it points out the need for care with coorelations and allows me to explain why people should not jump to the conclusion that PFCs and ultrasound cause autism.  Researchers that are qualified have to look at the data, determine if they think this might be an idea to examine, design the tests, and then communicate the results to other qualified scientists for them to test and examine.  Unfortunately, that is a slow process while we are facing a very urgent problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sabril, if you make a scatterplot of autism rates (log) vs percent vote for Obama (or some other measure of &quot;percentage of votes for democratic candidates in recent presidential elections&quot;) I would be happy to post it. Your idea doesn&#039;t easily explain why autism is higher among military families than in the general public nor does it explain the huge changes over time. I think plausible explanations for autism must be able, above all, to explain the huge increase over time; there is no precedent for such a giant change being due to diagnostic vagueness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did a google search for &quot;autism rates by state&quot; and found this chart:

http://www.stellamarie.com/index.php/2010/06/24/autism-rates-per-state

Just eyeballing it, it looks like there is a strong correlation between autism rates and percentage of votes for democratic candidates in recent presidential elections.  Put another way, there are a lot of blue states at the top of the list and a lot of red states at the bottom.

So my hypothesis is that there is something political at work.  For example, perhaps liberal states are more aggressive about diagnosing autistic children and putting them in special education.  Just from general observation of adults, it is clear that there are a good number of borderline autistic people.

Is there a clear, objective definition for autism which is universally applied?]]></description>
