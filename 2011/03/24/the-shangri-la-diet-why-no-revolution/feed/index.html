		<description><![CDATA[I think there is a lot to the &quot;loners and introverts&quot; comment. Yeah, those who have less invested in the standard belief system (e.g., &quot;calories in calories out&quot;) have less to lose by challenging it -- by trying something that violates that system. But because they are outsiders, they are less influential than people firmly in the mainstream. So they don&#039;t make good evangelists. This is related to another claim in this line of comments -- that I say things here that &quot;5 minutes thought&quot; would show to be untrue. This means I too am not a good evangelist. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a psychological problem with tricks. 
The idea of conditioning etc. Is not directly about nutrition (eat less eat differently) but a way around. And it does not register very well.

This is clearly a cognitive distortion. As tricks can be as useful or more than &quot;straight&quot; corrections.


I think that the very question in the headline assumes rationality and following logic. Ts is nit how human mind and public psyche works. 
The question builds in logic. Here is problem. Here is highly doable solution. Do it. But the sequence does not work in most humans.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think whenever something seems too easy or too good to be true, it turns off many people from taking a diet (for one example) seriously or even giving it a try. I&#039;ve always tried to have an open mind when it comes to matters of health and wellness in particular. So many so called &quot;fads&quot; ended up being the answer over the years. It wasn&#039;t so long ago that anyone who thought that diet had anything to do with cancer was considered uninformed or worse. I always thought it was the other way around, how could anyone NOT think that diet and cancer were linked?

As far as your diet is concerned, it works no matter what anyone thinks. The thousands of people who have been successful with your plan are proof of that. The lucky ones with open minds, willing to give yet another diet plan another try. This one&#039;s different though, because it&#039;s not really a diet and it does really work.

What I have found personally is that I am able to control how much I eat without using the sugar water or oil every day. The carry over is significant. And although the weight loss is slow, it&#039;s been significant about 25 lbs and I wasn&#039;t really overweight to begin with.

Thanks again Seth!

		<description><![CDATA[I bought the book on my Kindle and got up at 5 AM to finish reading it because I just know it will work. My husband who is naturally thin has always had a sugared drink between meals and he only eats two meals a day because of it.  I who struggle have always avoided sugar and I am hungry all day long. 

Today I had one tablespoon sugar in hot water like it was tea. Wonderful. I have no urge to snack. I also take flax oil seed capsules as well.  I am calm and free of my usual nagging hunger.  Let&#039;s see what happens. I would be happy to lose ten pounds.  Could it be this easy?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sadie, I found that 300 calories/day of sugar water produced roughly the same effect as 300 calories/day of extra-light olive oil. This equivalence is hard to explain if the sugar water and olive oil suppressed appetite in two different ways. Nor would your two different mechanisms explain why a third way of applying the theory behind SLD -- namely, noseclipping -- also appears to work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I may say so, your book often seemed condescending and angry. Those are not traits that make people want to take your advice.

I also felt that the mechanism (flavor-calorie learning) you described in your book seems incomplete. It is at best one of many forces making SLD work. For example, we know that eating carbohydrate without protein triggers the selective uptake of tryptophan into the brain, leading to an increased production of serotonin (see &quot;The Serotonin Power Diet has an easy-to-follow explanation of this, plus experimental verification). Increased serotonin lowers appetite. We also know that fats trigger a hormone response that suppresses appetite and causes the sphincter at the end of the stomach to close (YOU On a Diet has a tedious lay explanation, plus cartoons and lame jokes), causing you to feel full faster. It seems more likely to me that this is how appetite suppression occurs on SLD.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always been thin and my weight varies very little.  I also have a fairly poor sense of smell.  I can smell things -- but it seems to me not as keenly as other people.  

I wonder if these things are related.  Perhaps there is some test of sense of smell out there that could be correlated with body weight?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anna, I too noticed my balance was better when I tried using flaxseed oil (high in omega-3). Then I did a heap of experiments confirming the balance effect and showing there were other mental benefits, no doubt due to the omega-3. Canola oil, for all its problems, is high in omega-3. Butter is not. To continue the omega-3 benefits and get even more SLD calories, you might want to take 2 tablespoons/day of flaxseed oil, nose-clipped. Your gums should greatly improve as a result. I have posted about the visible benefits of omega-3 many times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Seth.  That&#039;s kind of awesome - hopefully one day I&#039;ll be able to respond to questions of, &quot;How have you lost so much weight?&quot;  with, &quot;Oh, I eat a half a stick of butter a day.  With a fork.&quot;  

I have noticed my balance is better, by the way.  I don&#039;t have a scale - I weigh myself on the wii fit.  I used to have to concentrate to stay balanced during the balance test or I would lean to the right.  Lately, I&#039;m always almost dead center. I also want less coffee and diet coke.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anna, canola oil often doesn&#039;t work well, for unknown reasons. I suggest you replace it with butter eaten noseclipped. I do 1/2 stick of butter per day (1/4 stick twice per day). I cut the 1/4 stick into 6 pieces and eat each piece of butter with a small piece of meat. 

Mark L, some of the noseclips I&#039;ve seen allow you to adjust them so that they are comfortable. You just bend the metal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if part of the problem is that the usual ideas about weight loss involve the drama of resisting temptation. While it isn&#039;t easy for a lot of people to get around to nose-clipping and consuming tasteless calories, those don&#039;t seem to have the visceral intensity of not eating food that one really wants and/or is generally considered very tempting, or of exercising when not exercising would be much more comfortable.

Admittedly, this is an ad hoc theory-- Atkins has the alternate drama of eating food one isn&#039;t supposed to, and getting at least some of the rewards which are supposed to go to low fat/deliberate calorie restriction.

At the same time, SLD is more work than the dream of effortless weight loss.]]></description>

<p>Admittedly, this is an ad hoc theory&#8211; Atkins has the alternate drama of eating food one isn&#8217;t supposed to, and getting at least some of the rewards which are supposed to go to low fat/deliberate calorie restriction.</p>
<p>At the same time, SLD is more work than the dream of effortless weight loss.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I was planning to tell lots of people about this diet when it worked, but  it isn&#039;t.  I bought the book at the beginning of March, got really excited and started doing about 3 tbs of canola a day.  I&#039;ve fiddled with the amounts (2 or 3 1/2 tbs) and the times I&#039;m taking it.  I am a bit less hungry, I guess, but my weight has been mostly stuck in one spot all month and today am up a pound and a half.  I suppose I&#039;ll try it for another week or so...  Any tips?  I am finding it impossible to look up specific advice on the forums.  I need to lose about 40 pounds, but at this point I think I&#039;d be thrilled with five.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jill, I once wondered if white fish cooked plain would cause weight loss. I couldn&#039;t eat it for more than a day or two so I share your view that bland food is unappealing. However, I have no trouble at all eating butter &amp; meat noseclipped. Because of the nose-clipping, it has no flavor; but I enjoy eating it because of the protein and fat. We have protein and fat receptors in our mouths. Food without smell can also be pleasant to eat due to crunchiness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i can pose another answer based on anecdote.

people i know who have tried fad diets or atkins are usually obnoxiously vocal about it.  not just that, it&#039;s part of their personality to be annoyingly vocal about personal matters.

people i know who have tried SLD are generally loners and introverts.

i have no idea why this is, or if it is something general or just confined to my circle.]]></description>
