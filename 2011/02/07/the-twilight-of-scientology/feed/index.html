		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the mention, that was a very interesting article in the New Yorker. I have read a fair amount about Scientology just out of a twisted curiosity, and have even had a Scientologist try to sign me up in a bar once.

The science and mythology behind it are so obviously ridiculous that I can&#039;t believe anyone would take it seriously, but obviously some do. The New Yorker article did seem to make the point that some useful techniques for resolving interpersonal conflicts, focusing one&#039;s energies, and getting ahead in your career might be taught, which I think would be interesting to learn about, if that could be separated from the cult aspects.

I have to admit though that &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; (written by L. Ron Hubbard) is one of my favorite sci-fi books, I&#039;ve read it about 5 times (all 1000+ pages). The movie was a total failure but the book is pretty good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t like the Church of Scientology (for reasons that I&#039;ll explain below), but I consider them to be mere pikers, Johnny-come-lately dilettantes when it comes to the business of evil cults.  By contrast, consider the Catholic Church, which has a long, rich history of abominations (think indulgences, Inquisition, &lt;i&gt;castrati&lt;/i&gt;, Galileo, birth control, etc.).  However, far fewer people seem to get upset by Catholicism than by Scientology.  But I digress from the point I wanted to make.

I certainly hope that the Scientologists are on their way out. They, unfortunately, adopted anti-psychiatry as one of their pet causes (also one of &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Epidemic-Bullets-Psychiatric-Astonishing/dp/0307452417&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pet causes&lt;/a&gt;), and thereby besmirched the whole movement.  In my more cynical moments, I can imagine Big Pharma making under-the-table payments to the Church of Scientology, in exchange for the Church&#039;s staunch opposition to psychotropic drugs.  &quot;Look!&quot;, cries Eli Lilly.  &quot;The enemies of Prozac are whacked-out loonies who believe in UFOs and galactic overlords!&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We also seem to be witnessing the end of Masonry.  It used to be that one had to be a Mason to get ahead in certain industries/companies.  Now those people have all retired or died.

Scientology was created by the SF author Ron Hubbard to prove some people will believe anything, wasn&#039;t it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Someone I loved many years ago was a member of this cult. That&#039;s what it is. It broke my heart to see how this group manipulated it&#039;s members, including this dear friend. 

I&#039;m amazed that anyone is still &quot;sucked in&quot; by this gibberish (I read the L. Ron Hubbard &quot;bible&quot; Dianetics at the time) but it still seems to appeal to many people, searching for some answers to life&#039;s tougher questions. My advice: Keep looking, you won&#039;t find them at the Church of Scientology.]]></description>
