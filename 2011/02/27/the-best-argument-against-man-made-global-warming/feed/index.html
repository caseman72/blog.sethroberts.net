		<description><![CDATA[Are we kidding here? Ok Co2 levels are at levels never recorded before. Co2 IS a greenhouse gas, but not the biggest one. Thats Methane. Guess what Methane is also at levels NEVER SEEN BEFORE! Your right, we cant accurately predict whats going to happen exactly. That should scare the crap out of you. The planet will respond. It always has, it always will. The responce WILL move the climate out of our comfort zone. There is no argument against Man Made Climate Change. There is scientific conceses, it is happening. We did it. The question is not will it happen, but just how bad it will get. If we stop now, perhaps not as bad as we can fear, if we keep giving out misinformation like this blog then it will get very bad indeed. The Cretacous was not a time human would like to live in. That was a natral climate. We have pushed the balance past that and into UNKOWN teritory. If that fact alond does not scare the pants off you then you are not paying attention.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess we&#039;re back where we started, which is not a bad place to be: you started with a quote including &quot;it is only when they add CO2 influences to the models that they can explain recent global warming&quot; and now you say the tests they pass are easy. Presumably you mean that it is easy to come up with a model that passes the same tests but doesn&#039;t depend on the CO2 sensitivity.  A model, as Levenson was noting, that generates the temperature distributions across different regions and different layers of the atmospheres and different day/night and winter/summer times, a model that may not be fully precise but was precise enough to show up the errors in Roy Spencer&#039;s satellite data and the paleo evidence Levenson notes and ... ? I wouldn&#039;t know how to do it, but I&#039;m just a programmer and ex-computer science prof. The tests they&#039;ve passed have looked pretty hard to me. Of course there are many tests they haven&#039;t passed yet, and may never pass (weather is fundamentally unpredictable unless it is someday actually controlled, in the sense that initial-measurement errors necessarily exist and necessarily grow exponentially; I have not seen anything to give me a strong opinion one way or the other on whether or not climate,  i.e. average weather, has strange-attractor problems of the same sort. My feeble opinion is no.) If somebody has come up with such a model, let them put it online as open source, like the GISS climate model, and let Hansen, Schmidt et al have a whack at it: I&#039;ll buy popcorn. Meanwhile, I am facing the fact that after more than 20 years I haven&#039;t seen such a model, and I&#039;ve been waiting for one. I predict that one won&#039;t be forthcoming. Will I bet my life on that? Am I absotively posilutely sure there isn&#039;t one? Of course not. It may exist. I think the climate models are pretty good; I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re the best guess we&#039;ve got; but it&#039;s not a perfect world, and being models they are certainly somewhat wrong, and they might be seriously wrong. 

That&#039;s not reassuring.

As Tyler Cowen said in a post called &quot;My views on global warming&quot;:&lt;em&gt;I do not much trust climate models. Perhaps I have spent too much time doing macro, and the experience carries over. Nonetheless uncertainty about final effects gives us more to worry about, not less. It is the worst-case scenarios for global warming which worry me, not the middling scenarios. Variance is our enemy in this matter.&lt;/em&gt; So it goes.

(It occurs to me that I really ought to have been writing code all this time, even if I got through the last deadline fine and the next one is a ways off. Anyway, thanks for lots of things.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, I&#039;m pleased you&#039;ve been able to use my treadmill/learning discovery. It&#039;s made a big difference to me, too.

About testing climate models: I wrote a paper with Hal Pashler about how to test complex models. That paper was about complex models in psychology but of course the same ideas apply in other areas. I&#039;m saying here what I said there.

In psychology, many professors (modelers) at respected universities were essentially cheating by exploiting a gap in understanding. They passed off a test that was easy to pass as a test that was hard to pass and thereby got their models published. The gap in understanding was that the reviewers of their papers didn&#039;t understand how to test a theory; they didn&#039;t understand what is and isn&#039;t a useful test. Proponents of the climate models we are talking about constantly do the same thing: treat an easy test as if it were a hard test. Their models have passed easy tests but not hard tests, as far as I can tell. It&#039;s as if they hand me Monopoly money and expect me to treat it like real money. When I say &quot;this money hasn&#039;t been tested&quot; they say: Look, it&#039;s the right size!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, Seth, you have done very valuable work in collecting surprises and turning them into theories. I was intrigued when I read Gelman&#039;s blog about your work, tried the diet myself a few months later, wrote about it more than a year after that at http://mistakesbytjm.blogspot.com/2007/02/exercise-diet-self-experimentation.html and I&#039;m sure that you have an important piece of the puzzle. What impressed me in the end about your model, the &quot;flavor-calorie theory&quot;, was the incidental predictions: you could lose weight with sugar water, but your model of that phenomenon then predicted that you could lose weight with unflavored oil, nose-clipping, crazy-spicing, etc, and they all worked -- at least for a lot of people, to some extent, with unpredictable individual variations as noted at the forum and random places on the internet. It&#039;s clear that the overall picture is complicated (and includes some Taubes-style stuff), but this belongs in it. If I Were In Charge, the main federal involvement in medicine would not be regulation but data-collection, and Roberts&#039; flavor-calorie theory would be one of the initial targets. As I said at http://mistakesbytjm.blogspot.com/2007/10/self-experimentation-dental-care-health.html &quot;I&#039;m very glad there are people like Seth Roberts in the universe.&quot;  Besides those items, I started this morning with 45 minutes, just short of five miles, on an elliptical machine with flash cards. Modern Greek flash cards, 45 elliptical minutes every morning -- I can&#039;t do it on a treadmill because my ankles start hurting after a few days. When I go back to Greece this summer (for a 2nd granddaughter&#039;s christening, my daughter-in-law being now Greek-American) I will do better than I did before, and you&#039;ve made it much easier. So -- thanks. 

But as I said, what made me take the flavor-calorie model seriously was the collection of incidental predictions; it wasn&#039;t just saying that you&#039;d made an observation about sugar water and more sugar water was better. Most useful models touch the world in many places. Your comment that we&#039;re coming out of an ice age, warming is common sense, is what I heard in the 80s from at least one of the scientists in my family (we run to PhDs, dunno why). He changed his mind when the trend (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming ) went further faster than he was expecting, more than ten years ago. I&#039;ve heard &quot;global warming has stopped, we&#039;re going to be cooling now&quot; claims since about that same time. Hansen published his curves in 1988, and that was controversial; do you have a comparable prediction from the same time-period, from &quot;common sense&quot; or geophysical modeling? I didn&#039;t have a strong sense of how much of a trend to expect, overall, but at about the same time I changed my own mind because there were a lot of incidental predictions, such as those I commented on and then quoted above (Arctic, etc). We&#039;re not talking about a single number-sequence; we&#039;re talking about a model, one which touches the world in many places. 

It sounds as if you are saying that you don&#039;t intend to check climate models by their incidental predictions because those aren&#039;t central, and you don&#039;t intend to check climate models by the central warming prediction because you were sort of expecting some warming anyway. And that sounds as if you simply don&#039;t want to think about it; you&#039;ll wait until...well, you&#039;ll wait, never mind the &quot;until&quot;. After all, it was below zero here in upstate NY this morning; surely the world&#039;s not warming. And that&#039;s okay; I&#039;m still glad there are people like Seth Roberts in the universe. :-)]]></description>

I already changed my mind, Nathan.  When I worked on the antidepressant team at a pharmaceutical company (in the 1990s), I had a largely positive view of antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs.  But I also learned some troubling things, and I maintained my interest in the subject long after I moved into a different line of work.

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, as the term Little Ice Age implies, global temperatures have been rising for a while. When Hansen predicts they will continue to rise at roughly the same rate -- and they do -- I hope you can see that that is no success for the model. You have to improve on common sense to be taken seriously. My weight-control theory led me to find that drinking sugar water can cause weight loss. That&#039;s wasn&#039;t common sense -- it was the opposite of what everyone believed. That&#039;s an example of what should increase belief in a theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two points, I guess.

(1) Seth, you say &lt;em&gt;The title shows this isnâ€™t about predictions, it is about fitting past data. Failing to understand the difference between prediction and fitting past data is so naive it seemed pointless to continue.&lt;/em&gt; I do indeed wonder if it&#039;s pointless to continue. If, say, Seth Roberts in his work on diet comes up with an appetite-model which implies a claim about the Paleolithic, and then somebody finds a cave in Iran with traces of ancient campfires which tests that claim, then I&#039;m gonna list it as a &quot;prediction&quot;; the fires themselves were not in your future, but the connection of your model to that data &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; in your future, and that&#039;s what counts epistemologically for evolutionary theory, for geology, for astrophysics or for climate change. 

These millenia-old datasets, reported in the 2008 article you&#039;re rejecting by title, were in the future for Arrhenius in 1896, for Broecker in 1975, and for the guys in between; those are the names in the &quot;Models&quot; column as having originated the general greenhouse-gas global warming prediction for which the 2008 article is among the &quot;Evidence.&quot; The compatibility of their models with that data strikes me as a genuine prediction-based test. (Of course the models are compatible with the rise in temperature with rising CO2 since the models were made, and that&#039;s another.)  And no, I don&#039;t know that Levenson&#039;s correct about this 2008 reference; I know about some of his references, but not this one. I&#039;m just saying I don&#039;t believe you can tell from the title that he&#039;s using &quot;prediction&quot; improperly.

(2) Seth, you say that &lt;em&gt;At any time â€” right now, 5 years ago, 10 years, 15 years ago â€” the people who work with those models and claim we should pay attention to their predictions could make/have made a set of predictions: next year, the year after that, and so on. Then, as time passed, we would have found out if the models predict correctly. The modelers havenâ€™t done that. &lt;/em&gt;
So far as I can tell, that&#039;s, well, that&#039;s not quite right. The people who work with these models have said what the models predict, which is a little like predicting the water level as the tide comes in during a storm: things go up and down a lot, and there&#039;s probably a storm surge adding a bias to your readings, so you &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; predict the exact level at any given time; prediction is rougher than that. It sounds like you&#039;re demanding that they predict the waves; if that&#039;s what you&#039;re demanding, there&#039;s not much point talking about it. I&#039;m interested in knowing if the models (which make lots of predictions by which to be tested) are basically correct, because if so things will get gradually hotter and many people think that will be a disaster but I just think it will be a problem -- if it gets hotter slowly, a solvable problem. So what predictions do they make? Well, the ones Levenson&#039;s page lists... and others. Most famously I&#039;m sure you&#039;re aware of Hansen&#039;s 1988 Scenarios A, B, and C with B being, he said, the most likely, and we now find, the closest to reality. I already linked to a discussion of that one, which has been dishonestly called a &quot;failure&quot; based on a false description (as described in the page I linked, and many other places) -- but was it, honestly, a &quot;success&quot;? That depends on how you score it. From a prediction-evaluation point of view on the page I linked, I&#039;d personally take most seriously &lt;em&gt;Hansen&#039;s model correctly projected amplified warming in the Arctic, as well as hot spots in northern and southern Africa, west Antarctica, more pronounced warming over the land masses of the northern hemisphere, etc.  The spatial distribution of the warming is very close to his projections. &lt;/em&gt; That seems to me to speak to the underlying mechanism of the model. The exact amount is off, but not by much; the best description, as per that web page and other discussions I&#039;ve seen, is simply that the  climate sensitivity number Hansen used (that&#039;s one parameter, one number) was within the currently-accepted range, but at the high end, while the number that would have made his curve come out &quot;right&quot; is slightly lower, near the middle of that currently-accepted range.

So, looking at that, I look at what the critics (besides the dishonest ones) say about it, and I look for somebody who finds a way to justify an extremely low climate sensitivity number with some other model -- something that will also produce amplified warming in the Arctic, etc. And so far, I don&#039;t find it. So far, I&#039;m left with the simplest description being &quot;Hansen&#039;s climate sensitivity number was a bit high, but it looks like he got things pretty much right.&quot; That, to me, is a fairly reassuring description, because it suggests that we may not have real climate disasters before we can develop the technology to warm or cool the Earth as much as we want. I&#039;m a Moore&#039;s-Law sort of geek. But it&#039;s not completely reassuring, because all models are wrong, and I do not feel that uncertainty in this matter is my friend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, you remind me of a surgeon I consulted who said there was plenty of evidence that the operation she recommended was a good idea. I could easily find the evidence using Google, she said. I could not find it. My mom, a medical librarian, could not find it. Confronted with these failures, the surgeon said she would find it. She never did. Let me make a prediction: You are never going to supply an example of the &quot;successful prediction&quot; you claim exists.

Tom, I looked at the page you linked to. The main prediction of the models is that there will be excessive warming, so I was especially curious about &quot;global warming&quot; predictions. The latest paper (of evidence) should be the best. Here is the latest paper that page gives:

Mann, M.E., Z. Zhang, M.K. Hughes, R.S. Bradley, S.K. Miller, S. Rutherford, and F. Ni 2008. &quot;Proxy-based reconstructions of hemispheric and global surface temperature variations over the past two millennia.&quot; Proceedings of the National Academies of Science 105, 13252-13257.

The title shows this isn&#039;t about predictions, it is about fitting past data. Failing to understand the difference between prediction and fitting past data is so naive it seemed pointless to continue.

		<description><![CDATA[sorry, not sure how that last was pre-submitted. Anyway I was going it say that:

Now, it&#039;s quite true that this doesn&#039;t give us a usefully testable prediction of the temperature of 2015, it gives us a range. So climate scientists do offer to place bets, but it&#039;s not like betting that the Moon will be in its predicted position as of the year 2,000,000AD. But if you&#039;re talking, as Nathan is and as I believe you are, about predictions used to validate a model -- well, as I said, it&#039;s been quite a while since I felt able to laugh at the climate models. (And as Nathan suggests, and as I think Tyler Cowen has said, &quot;uncertainty is not your friend&quot; in this issue; if I were confident that the models were correct, and that the real problem is the long-run problem, then I&#039;d worry less about climate change than I do.)

		<description><![CDATA[Sean: By &quot;for nothing&quot;, I meant &quot;to avert a catastrophe which later information indicated was not imminent&quot;.  Such an outcome might, for example, result from an (evidently delayed!) adjustment to changing conditions that increases the biosphere&#039;s ability to sequester carbon.  We might imagine marine plankton evolving (mystifyingly slowly) to grow thicker shells, which sink to the ocean bottom and remove carbon from circulation.  I don&#039;t know of any reason why that would occur. All the evidence we have indicates it&#039;s not.

Remaining on coal and oil has imposed, and imposes, ruinous costs on the world not directly borne by extractors or purchasers.   &lt;i&gt;Only one&lt;/i&gt; of these is the ecological-network collapse and mass extinction that we see following global warming .  Another is the ongoing obliteration of coral reefs by carbonic acid, and the fisheries that depend on them.  Another is the pervasive distribution of mercury that had been safely sequestered underground.  Another is the widespread tyranny and military oppression that ensures the elites&#039; exclusive access to carbon found under poor peoples&#039; land.  (I could go on.)  A carbon tax, applied scrupulously, would direct a tiny fraction of those costs back to users, and fund an efflorescence of new industries that have long been suppressed by the artificially low prices of oil and coal, soon eliminating such dependence and all of the costs.

We have already &quot;waited a little longer&quot;, again, and again, and again.  All but 2 of some 2000 NAS members consider it solid already.  Can you identify any condition that you would interpret to demonstrate the science has solidified? Are you holding out for unanimity?

Alex: Disingenuousness should be beneath us here.

I&#039;d like to take the opportunity to explore why the double-blind trials always touted as the &quot;gold standard&quot; of drug effectiveness testing fail.  It comes down to diagnostic categories.  If symptom A has underlying causes M, N, O, P, ...,  of which N is seen, clinically, to be effectively treated with drug D, then the success of a trial depends entirely on how well you can distinguish N from M and O &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; resorting to D.  If you cannot distinguish them with lab tests, then a trial must include a full population of sufferers of M, N, O, P, ...  It will only prove that D is ineffective for most of them, a fact you already knew all too well.

This difficulty with trials does not, in practice, cripple effective treatment, except insofar as it keeps useful compounds out of the pharmacopoeia. Psychiatrists and oncologists try D, E, F, ... in succession, and when one is found to work, stop there.  It&#039;s a stone-age approach that reflects stone-age diagnostic capabilities, but the primitiveness of our present diagnostic capabilities should not keep patients from receiving treatments that are very often very effective.

Seth, all you need to do is step out of the echo chamber of the denialists, and you will find yourself deluged with compelling evidence.  Bring a kayak.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean: By &#8220;for nothing&#8221;, I meant &#8220;to avert a catastrophe which later information indicated was not imminent&#8221;.  Such an outcome might, for example, result from an (evidently delayed!) adjustment to changing conditions that increases the biosphere&#8217;s ability to sequester carbon.  We might imagine marine plankton evolving (mystifyingly slowly) to grow thicker shells, which sink to the ocean bottom and remove carbon from circulation.  I don&#8217;t know of any reason why that would occur. All the evidence we have indicates it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Remaining on coal and oil has imposed, and imposes, ruinous costs on the world not directly borne by extractors or purchasers.   <i>Only one</i> of these is the ecological-network collapse and mass extinction that we see following global warming .  Another is the ongoing obliteration of coral reefs by carbonic acid, and the fisheries that depend on them.

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, I don&#039;t see how we can get off our coal-and-oil habit &quot;for nothing&quot;.  Every decision has a cost.  There are no free lunches.  In this case, imposing carbon emission limitations is likely to have a very heavy economic cost in developing countries, by severely limiting their economic growth.  By limiting economic growth, we are prolonging the time they are shackled in poverty, which I would say is a very heavy cost.  You might say that we (the developed world) should do all the R&amp;D for renewable energy technology, then pass the benefits along to the developing world, but I doubt this can be done a) anytime soon, and b) without still imposing a high economic and therefore social cost to them.  Of course the cost of doing nothing at all is that we do wreak havoc to the climate system, but there is still much uncertainty there, whereas the economic/social cost of reducing carbon is much more certain.  On balance, it seems that the most prudent course of action is to wait a little longer for the science to solidify before acting one way or another.]]></description>
