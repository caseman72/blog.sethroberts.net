		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m uncomfortable with the evolving definition of &quot;citizen scientist&quot; as a helper or assistant or collector of data. While these are important to scientific research, it&#039;s not clear to me that it leads to the kind of personal science you&#039;re talking about, or to a greater understanding of science for the citizen scientist. 

But all that being said, the definition of &quot;personal science&quot; here strikes me as the end goal for any science education that does not take one to a professional scientific career. Science as it is taught should focus on using it in daily life, rather than as a sifting process to identify likely career scientists.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who plans to major in neuroscience, I believe what you are saying about personal science. Science is very personal. It allows one to connect with the universe in the deepest ways. The ability to apply logic and reason can, for some, help to appreciate what is. 

With modern fields in quantum physics, neuroscientists cannot afford to be strictly materialist any more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; personal science

The term is accurate; I like it.

&gt; Personal is about goals, whereas individual is about methods. 

I think you&#039;re splitting hairs; both definitions are valid. Plus, how can you do personal science without the scientific method? Or at least the spirit of it.

&gt; My self-experimentation is not citizen science.

I agree, and I also think we need to move that conversation to that of individuals doing science, i.e., to making citizen scientists. I sketched some ideas here: http://quantifiedself.com/2011/02/making-citizen-scientists/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nancy, yes I include non-quantitative work. Sometimes effects are so clear you don&#039;t need numerical measurement to study them. The effect of pork fat on my sleep was/is so clear I didn&#039;t need numerical measurement of my sleep to notice or confirm it.

Gunnar, the term &lt;em&gt;individual science&lt;/em&gt; doesn&#039;t clearly exclude professional self-experimentation (by professional scientists, for their careers) which is what I am trying to exclude. &lt;em&gt;Personal &lt;/em&gt;is about goals, whereas &lt;em&gt;individual &lt;/em&gt;is about methods.]]></description>

<p>Gunnar, the term <em>individual science</em> doesn&#8217;t clearly exclude professional self-experimentation (by professional scientists, for their careers) which is what I am trying to exclude. <em>Personal </em>is about goals, whereas <em>individual </em>is about methods.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Would you include non-quantitative work like the invention of the Alexander Technique? 

About a century ago, F.M. Alexander had problems with losing his voice, and found that rest didn&#039;t help. He concluded that there was something he was doing when he spoke, and eventually found (with the help of three-way mirrors) that he was tightening his muscles as part of preparation to speak. Then he found ways to break such a strong unconscious habit.

This is close observation and testing hypotheses, but no statistics.]]></description>
