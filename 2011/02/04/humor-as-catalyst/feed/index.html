It&#039;s worth noting on here that, while humor can be used as a catalyst for positive change, there are also subtle implications if used incorrectly. I work in innovation and the term my company coined, &quot;humorous bazooka&quot;, is a funny, witty comment that, intentionally or unintentionally, shoots down another person’s idea (read: innovation killer). You can read more about our thoughts on it here: http://bit.ly/gnobzb

Just good to talk about the good, bad, and the ugly of humor!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read this quote from an old counseling textbook and it has stuck with me:

&quot;Humor makes it easier to explore difficult, awkward, or nonsensical aspects of life. It can be used to challenge beliefs or magnify irrational beliefs to absurdity.&quot;]]></description>
