How much whiskey in the yogurt? Won&#039;t the alcohol kill the microbes? Or at least get them way drunk?

		<description><![CDATA[JRF, I have yet to figure out a good way to study the dosage question. My guess is that several servings per day is a good idea. I eat 2 servings of yogurt/day plus 1 glass of kombucha. Plus kimchi, pickles, etc., when available.

Alrenous, re &quot;looking into the heart of the burger and seeing what others have not.&quot; Umami Burger isn&#039;t terribly mysterious (umami makes food taste better) but it&#039;s quite true that many others haven&#039;t seen this simple truth about what makes food taste good. Last night a friend told me she had gotten a yogurt machine. We discussed how to eat yogurt. I said I put whiskey in mine -- a way to add complexity. She said she hadn&#039;t heard of such a thing.]]></description>
