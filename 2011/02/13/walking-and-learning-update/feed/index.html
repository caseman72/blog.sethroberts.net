		<description><![CDATA[I lived in Tehran most of the time between 1963 and 1980.  Seeing high school and college students studying while walking in public parks and narrow streets was a very ordinary sight during final-exam season.  A vital part of the process was repeating the material out loud, over and over, usually to the rhythm of the steps.  It reminded me of how easily children learn nursery rhymes, even when they do not understand the meaning of the words, especially when they accompany them with specific gestures or movements.  My mother always said that the more senses are involved, the better one learns.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oli M, thanks for the suggestion.

Tom, yeah, the evolutionary reason you give (&quot;to map the resources and dangers of large amounts of terrain while walking through it&quot;) is close to what I suggested earlier (&quot;to push people to walk in new places (which provide something to learn) rather than old places (which donâ€™t)&quot;).

vic, to make writing grant proposals pleasant I suggest you divide the task into tiny pieces and after finishing each tiny piece give yourself a reward.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Damien Elmes, the developer of Anki, is pretty friendly and very responsive to user input about Anki. I&#039;m sure he would be happy to hear the observations of an experimental psychologist on how to improve his learning tool, if you were to &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/ankisrs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;post on the forum&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to respond to just about every thread personally.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Darrin, by the &quot;arrrr word&quot; you mean &quot;regulate&quot;? Yeah, I think there is some sort of bigger case to be made for regulation of learning -- more evidence that points in the same direction -- but I cannot figure out what it is.

Thomas, you say &quot;Anki definitely has progress graphs.&quot; My version (the latest) has eight graphs. Four show something (y axis) versus day in the past (x axis). The four graphs are reps, review time, number added, and first seen.Â  None of those four is how much you have learned (which is the progress I care about). One of them shows reviews of mature cards. The total number of mature cards would be a measure of learning but they don&#039;t show that as a function of day. The Pinyin Plugin includes a graph of progress, which is one sign that plain Anki lacks such a thing.

M, my treadmill goes under two names. In America it is the AFG 5.0 treadmill; in China, it is the Elite T5000. (They are slightly different -- the American version, with the 3.0 HP motor, is better.) I bought from a store in Beijing with the website www.93bill.com.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Anki lacks a graph of progress â€” a graph that shows amount of learning versus date. But it is better than flashcards.

I use Mnemosyne, but that would surprise me. Leaving aside the issue that &#039;learning&#039; isn&#039;t a clear metric (# of cards ranked 4? Average ranking? # of cards with intervals longer than a month? A week?), I had understood that Anki had tons of statistics. Even Mnemosyne can display basic statistics like # of cards ranked 4, or 5.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always found riding on a bus/train and reading is very pleasant (not so much cars or planes). I thought it was that it gave the illusion of progress while doing something sedentary. Or maybe it was the moving scenery, which provided a break from the reading.]]></description>
