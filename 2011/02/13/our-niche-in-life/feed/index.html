		<description><![CDATA[My personal observation on talents is that people tend to grow a talent where they enjoy things.  For instance, I was a crummy writer, but an enthusiastic one, for about six years (fifth grade to eleventh) before I had a breakthrough and, literally overnight, &quot;got&quot; writing.

In the autobigraphical book by physicist Richard Feynmann, &quot;Surely You&#039;re Joking, Mr. Feynmann!&quot;, he tells a story of an artist he befriends.  They make a deal, that his friend will teach him to be an artist, and he will teach his friend to be a scientist.  Starting this well into adulthood, Feynmann develops into a very accomplished artist, with seemingly no innate knack.

So, in short, I agree with you, that our specialized skills are not innate.  At the same time, though, the interests that drive us toward certain activities do have an innate root in our personality.  As in, my girlfriend could possibly learn to do programming, but she could not learn to do it for the same reason that I do it. Or, a crude metaphor, a straight woman could successfully have sex with another woman, but she won&#039;t be doing it with the innate excitement with which a straight man would do it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[D, I&#039;m not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;totally discredited (outside the family environment, where it is correct)&quot;. I have read what Judith Rich Harris said on the subject; I found it one-sided. I believe Sulloway could have done a better job of defending himself from the criticism Harris describes. His legal threats took the air out of the room. A great distraction. In any case, I think the extent to which one does what one&#039;s parents want -- which Sulloway says is controlled by birth order -- really matters. The smaller the world, the more your parents are the status quo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought Sulloway&#039;s work had been totally discredited (outside the family environment, where it is correct)?  At least that&#039;s the (very strong) impression I got from reading Judith Rich Harris when she summarizes the conclusions of those who have critiqued his work - both his methodology and looking at other data to see if his hypothesis is borne out.  No doubt was meant to be left in the reader&#039;s mind.]]></description>
