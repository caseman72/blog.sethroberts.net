		<description><![CDATA[As a Tokyo resident, I&#039;m encouraged by your post...I really hope it&#039;s true.  

I&#039;m curious though, would you choose to live in a place like Tokyo where there&#039;s higher than normal radiation in the food/water and possibly the air for the possible benefits?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That said, this question of hormetics is very complex.  A good case in point is the hormetic effects of resveratrol.  At a lower dose, for example, it may be good for heart protection but also conducive to tumor formation.  In other words, the biomedical endpoint determines whether some of these substances are &quot;good&quot; or not.  They may be &quot;good&quot; for one biomedical endpoint and &quot;bad&quot; for another.   Please see this interesting article by one of the leading researchers in hormetics, Calabrese:
http://www.belleonline.com/newsletters/volume16/vol16-2.pdf

&quot;The current assessment indicates that low concentrations 
of resveratrol can be potentially beneficial or harmful, 
depending on the endpoint of interest.  The data suggest 
that low doses of resveratrol would have the capacity to 
increase the risk of tumor development of a number of 
organs based on its capacity to enhance cell proliferation 
in multiple human tumor cell lines.  In contrast, a strong 
case can be made that low doses of resveratrol can be 
significantly cardio-protective.  &quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I my lazyness I haven&#039;t read the linked articles of the studies. What kind of radiation do they refer to?

I would assume that not all radiation are equal.

Thanks,

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;They found that once you adjust for age and demographics the cancer incidence went up.&quot;

Well, yeah. 97% reduction in morbidity is way too high to be fully believable. But with separate studies with a similar effect, the question is one of magnitude, not sign. 

From the study:
&quot;increase risks of developing certain cancers in specific subgroups&quot;

Shockingly, making your body work harder is not risk-free. Hence Seth&#039;s,

&quot;The plausibility of such a large benefit should have led to experiments.&quot;

However, I would also caution against dosing yourself on rads just based on these studies. I symbolize it this way: should those dockworkers expose themselves to even more radiation? So: how do you measure the ideal exposure for yourself as an individual, rather than a population mortality statistic?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a place called Bad Gastein in Austria and about a hundredfifty years back a bright doctor realised that the miners working the saltmines were a lot healthier than the general populace. Knowing he was unto a good thing he bought the mines - they were on the point of running dry - and starting selling time in the mines by the hour to the - wealthy - unhealthy. The company he founded is still in business today. Back then they thought it must be the highly mineralised air, today it is assumed that the slightly elevated radioactivity in there is the key.
The good doctor lived to the age of ninety by the way - quite a feat in those times.]]></description>
