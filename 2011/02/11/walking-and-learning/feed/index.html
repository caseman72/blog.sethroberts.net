		<description><![CDATA[Anthony, I walked around routes I was familiar with. Mostly I walked in a nearby park, which was flat and nearly empty of people. This allowed me to pay more attention to the flashcards. A treadmill is far better for this sort of learning because I don&#039;t have to pay attention to anything else. I think I&#039;m the first person to report such an effect -- that learning dry facts, usually unpleasant, becomes pleasant while walking. I think the simplicity of the treadmill is why it was clear. My treadmill faces a blank wall. Surely I am not the first person to study while walking. I think ordinary walking is pleasant. I think it is much harder to notice a change from pleasant to more pleasant than a change from unpleasant to pleasant. Because treadmill walking (by itself, facing a blank wall) is slightly unpleasant, it made an increase in pleasantness easier to detect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, in your other post you mention trying flashcards while walking around Tsinghua. Did you try this walking new routes, or walking routes you were familiar with? 

Similarly, have you tried walking routes you were familiar with and that had few people?]]></description>
