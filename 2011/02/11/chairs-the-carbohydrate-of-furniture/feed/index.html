		<description><![CDATA[i think my last content was truncated because i used a less than sign.  trying again.  if this works, please delete the above?

what was interesting to me after going to SLD (lost 20 pounds in half a year after 10 in a year with a willpower diet, stopped gradually six months ago and have gained less than 1 pound since then) was that when i went on there was an immediate change in how my body felt after eating carbs.  prior to starting, i felt kind of wishy-washy after carbs -- couldn&#039;t tell whether i was hungry, felt a craving for more, so hard to stop.  after just a short time on SLD -- maybe it was immediate -- carbs made me feel full.  ambiguity about being hungry or not hungry was gone, and cravings were much, much lower.  that&#039;s persisted more or less until now.  and it&#039;s PLEASANT not having so many cravings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think low carb diets work because they push people away from foods that have (a) the same flavor each time and (b) lots of quickly-digested calories. Foods that have the same flavor each time are usually food in packages or fast food. And those foods are usually high in carbs: soft drinks, candy, french fries. I have avoided such foods for a long time. When I went from medium carb to low carb I lost no weight. When I stopped eating foods that taste the same each time, not worrying about carbs, I quickly lost weight.

I recommend an hour of walking daily because only that caused my fasting blood sugar to be normal. (I posted maybe a year ago about this.) Aerobic exercise every few days did not. Movement throughout the day because it&#039;s pretty clear our bodies are not meant to sit all day. Nor stand in one place all day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -

I&#039;m familiar with your learned calorie association theory and have lost a significant amount of weight as a result, but am curious your take on why so many others have been successful through only eating a low carb diet?

Why do you recommend daily movement and an hour of walking?  Also why walking as opposed to other aerobic exercises?

TIA]]></description>
