		<description><![CDATA[Doctors are clueless :( they start off with a decent education, next they get real hands on training and get their license... they are good, honest doctors. But then they get visits from drug reps daily... the so bombarded by propaganda and sales bullshit and out right lies. Then on top of all this they have to run a business, dealing with all the insurance with what they will pay or won&#039;t. This &quot;system&quot; that these good doctors are put through would drive anyone crazy. They don&#039;t practice medicine anymore because they can&#039;t!!! they are not allowed to :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 

I understand what you are saying, but I think you are taking too lightly the complexity of the human organism.  I don&#039;t view self-experimentation on the human body as a simple research project, because there can be some very real and even fatal consequences.  I have no problem with learning, and I think it should be encouraged, but let us take your example and expand it.  If you were learning about efficient synthesis of Nitro Glycerin, or Serin gas would you go off and try to experimentally come up with a solution or would you seek guidance from already established knowledge before tackling it?  One misstep in either of those scenarios could bring disaster.

This is where I have a problem with the over prescription of medications in this country.  I think doctors are too quick to prescribe when many drugs are going to have an impact on the balance of the overall organism.  At the root of everything, we are really just a giant set of complex chemical reactions, but they feed off each other with feedback mechanisms and &quot;on off switches&quot; based on which enzymes become activated and inactivated.  Throwing a drug or chemical into that mix will upset the balance.

The self-experimentation I would advocate is common sense and good health that can be obtained through a good diet and regular exercise.  Of course I could be overthinking your definition of self experimentation.  I suppose I should read more of your blog now ^^]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Grundle, thank you for your helpful reply. Here is what is to me the most interesting part:

&lt;em&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not know a doctor that would be happy with self-experimentation either. . . .Self-experimentation without guidance is dangerous. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

This is a fascinating state of affairs. What if a teacher said they were unhappy if a student learned on his/her own? &lt;em&gt;Learning without guidance is dangerous&lt;/em&gt;, the teacher might say. If doctors knew 100% of the relevant info, then there would indeed be no need for self-experimentation. You would just follow the doctor&#039;s orders. But what if doctors knew only 10% of the relevant info? Or less? Which is not to be critical of doctors. They are merely the part of the health care system that has the most contact with the rest of us. It is deep inside the system that ignorance is dressed up as wisdom.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Seth - Sorry to wait so long to get back to this.  I am not sure this is based on anything specific.  To be fair, I do a lot of volunteering at a free medical clinic as an interpreter which gives me an advantageous viewpoint of seeing both the viewpoint of the doctors and the patients.  Since I effectively become the path of communication between them it is a perfect vantage point to be able to observe and make conclusions on what is happening.

Because it is a volunteer clinic run in association with a medical school there are also students learning there, so I get to see the entire gamut of attitudes from the doctor&#039;s perspective and since it is a general clinic it is like playing the lottery on knowing what kind of malady the patient will have.

@David Harmon brought up a good point when he mentioned doctor&#039;s toeing the line with respect to insurance.  The fact is, it is even more convoluted than that, because they also have to be aware of swindlers/hypochondriacs who want to get a quick fix of pain killers etc.  Doctors have to be on the lookout for not only physical illness but mental illness and respond accordingly.  If they work in a hospital they are also required to treat anybody that comes in regardless of their Insurance status.  That is a fact.

@Seth I think your reaction was correct in your case.  You had knowledge of research and asked her to respond to it, which she could not.  I do not think that she acted in an ethical manner and as such I would be leery in seeing a doctor of that caliber.  Like anything, the relationship between a doctor and patient is predicated on trust and when a physician breaks that bond there really is no way for them to provide adequate care for that patient.  

@Lisa Wagner - I do not know a doctor that would be happy with self-experimentation either.  I know tons of doctors that would be willing to take your ideas into account, sit down with you and try to come up with a plan to tackle the issues.  Basically when you throw the doctors advice away for your own self-experimentation you are saying that you know more than they do, which from the perspective of human biology and the scientific approach of treating human illness you are way behind, but I am sure they are lacking in your knowledge of self-awareness.  Self-experimentation without guidance is dangerous.  As for the issue of &quot;invasive&quot; procedures, I also agree with you that many times this isn&#039;t the best approach, but once again doctors have been bound by legal issues.  They are basically required to rule out a number of things based on the symptoms, and this precedent has been established due to any number of malpractice lawsuits that have been filed over the years.  It is really a no-win for the doctors if you think about it.  At least that is how it is here in the US, I can&#039;t speak for the UK.]]></description>

Because a literature search established there was no good reason for the surgery. That was more conclusive than anything a doctor could say.

I’m not discounting the value of what you’re saying, but in this case you might have saved a lot of effort by just doing what many patients commonly do already.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are a couple of funny things about this.  If Dr. Consorti had just admitted her mistake and eaten a little crow, she probably could have avoided the whole issue.  Instead, she has to spend a lot of money to hire a firm to restore her on-line reputation.

The other funny thing is that I wonder whether her &quot;reputation consultants&quot; actually know what they&#039;re doing.  Note to Dr. Consorti:  You&#039;d be better off using hyphens in the URLs to separate your names:  i.e., instead of eileenconsorti.wordpress.com use eileen-consorti.wordpress.com.  Similarly, use eileen-consorti-md.com instead of eileenconsortimd.com.  If you use hyphens, search engines will treat the names as separate words.  (No charge for my advice.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Grundle, I have met a lot of doctors in my capacity as a sick person and a few as a healthy person. I have yet to meet one who is happy to accept that my self-experimentation has made me healthy. Some even find it hard to believe that I actually am healthy - i.e. refusing to believe my experience and wanting to do expensive, invasive medical tests to &#039;check&#039; that what they are seeing with their own clinical judgement is true. That is what I mean by not being able to think. But that is only my experience. 

This is not to say that I have not met nice doctors or doctors who genuinely care about their patients. Being caring and nice and wanting to do the right thing does not necessarily result in effective treatment (although it can be extremely helpful and supportive) - especially if a doctor does not listen to the patient and think for themselves. 

I often think of this as an agency problem. Doctors in the UK don&#039;t work for the patient - they work for the NHS. But similarly, the doctor that Seth encountered has also lost her agency. She doesn&#039;t understand that she should be working for her patient (as her patient pays her directly) and the reverse of personal recommendation happened to her -  which risks her livelihood (evidenced by how much spent on reputation repair). Her extra bad luck that her patient had an influential blog.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d say there&#039;s an even bigger factor than arrogance involved, which is interference from the health insurance companies.

		<description><![CDATA[Many of you are quick to excoriate doctors while discounting the bewildering amount of knowledge they have to keep track of.  Classifying doctors as &quot;non-thinkers&quot; is disingenuous and untrue.  

The biggest problem I see with doctors is either arrogance or greed.  When either of those two get in the way it clouds their ability to provide the best care to patients.  An arrogant doctor obviously won&#039;t listen to a patient because he &quot;knows better&quot;.  It is easy to see how someone&#039;s view can become so jaundiced when they have to sacrifice four grueling years to medical school and another four to residency.  I imagine that many doctors resent a patient who really doesn&#039;t know anything, but what they read from some article.  In truth, I think the cases where self-diagnosis and self-treatment are successful happen to be the minority.  Remember that the body is so complicated that we still don&#039;t completely understand how it works.  Just understanding cellular metabolism is a challenge.  That is only a small percentage of the entire corpus of knowledge a doctor is expected to master.

The second case is the greedy doctor that is only in it for the money.  This is how I see the physician in this article.  She probably knows that the condition is minor, but the accepted approach is always surgery and that means she gets payed to perform that surgery.  Every surgery is a paycheck and if someone is greedy enough they will line as many up as possible without worrying about monitoring the condition to see if it gets worse.

There is a third type of doctor that is there for their patients.  They listen to what the patient says and strive to provide the best care possible.  I have met many of these doctors, and although they are not infallible, they constantly work to make sure they are giving the best and most up to date care possible.

My point is that if you have questions and your doctor cannot answer them satisfactorily then find a physician who will take the time to sit down and answer your questions, and tell you why his approach may be better  In every profession there are idiots who will make the entire group look bad, however shunning the entire group because of those idiots is not an adequate response either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[New to your blog, but your thinking paralells what my wife and I have been figuring out over the last few years.  One of the things that bothers me about &quot;Obamacare&quot; or any &#039;one size fits all&#039; healthcare &#039;fix&#039; is the idea that the current healthcare system is too reliant on pharmacological and surgical solutions.  We&#039;ve known many people who are too quick to seek solutions to their health problems via surgery or drugs.  Surgeries ARE dangerous and drugs almost always have side effects.  The benefits of surgery and or prescription drugs need to be seriously weighed against the downside (not to mention the ongoing expense).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;&quot;My suspicion is that most doctors are more like priests than scientists.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

Yeah, that&#039;s a good question: What fraction of what doctors do is priest-like, and what fraction scientist-like?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;&quot;I think Dr. Consorti’s mistake was when she told you there were plenty of studies on point.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

 I think that when she discovered my blog post, which apparently bothered her, she should have done the search, told me the result, and asked me to amend the post. [&lt;strong&gt;More&lt;/strong&gt; After I wrote that, she did so -- see above]
&lt;em&gt;
&quot;Many doctors would say they are too busy to look for or provide the type of research you were asking for.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; 

I agree. One doctor said this in the comments on a previous post. Keep in mind that Dr. Consorti would be paid a considerable amount of money for doing the operation she had recommended.]]></description>
