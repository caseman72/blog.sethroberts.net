		<description><![CDATA[M, you write &quot;A blogger can be wrong on an issue and simply attract comments from others who have the same wrong view.&quot; By &quot;the truth&quot; I don&#039;t mean objective truth -- I mean it in the sense of what a person really thinks. Whether they like what you&#039;ve written, whether they like what you&#039;re wearing. &lt;em&gt;Truth&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of &quot;tell the truth&quot; (versus lie). People may have what you think is &quot;the wrong view&quot; but when they post comments stating that view or agreeing with that wrong view, they are telling the truth, as I am using the word.  

That said, I agree with John Harper, what&#039;s the &quot;one issue&quot;  that I write about where I have the wrong view and people just echo me? My guess is man-made climate change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[M: Your comment might be more useful if you&#039;d tell us what you think that one major issue is, and also why you think Seth is wrong about it. Don&#039;t let us languish in ignorance!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You say that writing a blog is one way to get others to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, I don&#039;t think it necessarily works this way.  A blogger can be wrong on an issue and simply attract comments from others who have the same wrong view, eventually driving out those who have other views.   I suspect this happens a lot in the world, leading to &quot;echo chamber&quot; blogs.  In fact, I think this has happened in the case of one major issue that you write about on your blog.  (I think you are right on many other issues, though!)]]></description>
