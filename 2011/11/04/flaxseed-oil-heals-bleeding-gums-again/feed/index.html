		<description><![CDATA[This is an interesting, yet positive, reaction to taking flaxseed oil.  I&#039;ve always know flaxseed oil was an excellent plant-source of omega 3 fatty acids and their anti-inflammatory effects.  I wonder if these effects would occur if you took an omega 3 fish oil or other sources of omega 3 fatty acids?  Nevertheless, I definitely agree with the use of omega 3 supplements;  our bodies cannot make these essential fats so it&#039;s very important we get these healthy fats in our diets.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Have you noticed any increase in hair loss/thinning as you changed your omega 3 consumption?&quot; No I haven&#039;t.

Why anti-inflammatories should increase hair loss -- if they do -- I have no idea. 

One of my students is measuring hair loss. He is also working on a study about inflammation. Perhaps he will be interested in studying this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I tried posting a question before and it appears to have not gone through. so I&#039;ll try again.

Have you noticed any increase in hair loss/thinning as you changed your omega 3 consumption?  There appear to be several people (40+) who posted on a hair loss blog with the observation that increased flax/fish oil produced significant hair loss/thinning.  Several of the comments were from women, which I found interesting.  Less clear was the effect of ground flax seed, which contains lignans, vs flax oil.  Some claimed it thickened hair, others that it thinned.  Since you&#039;ve used both methods for a long period, I&#039;m wondering if you could give your observations.  Also, anecdotally, there appears to be a link between turmeric intake and an increase in hair loss.  What is it with anti-inflammatories that could potentially have this side effect?

(the fourth google hit for &quot;flax seed hair loss&quot; contains a blog post where most of the comments I&#039;m referring to come from, though they appear in many other places across the web)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I agree regarding flossing.  I am a regular flosser who never had bleeding gums, yet I did have inflammation which manifested itself in the form of periodontal pockets.  I was told the pockets were the result of genetic bone loss.  As I posted previously on your blog, I significantly shrunk these pockets between visits to the dentist (6 months) by drinking flaxseed oil.

On a different topic, I&#039;m wondering how (if) you reconcile the ideas of people like Chris Masterjohn who believe that the degeneration of PUFA is what drives atherosclerosis.  I know flaxseed oil helps my gums, and I have a hunch it may help with my degenerating lumbar disc, but I am concerned about the seemingly contradictory effect on my vascular system.  Thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim, with regard to your procedure for taking flax oil:  I take about four tablespoons -- straight -- every day around noon, as part of my Shangri-La diet regimen.  I do not make much effort to mask the taste.  Sometimes I chase the oil with water, but I don&#039;t always do it, if I&#039;m busy.  Still works for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rashad, that&#039;s a good point. I found the same thing as you: if I flossed enough, my gums stopped bleeding. However, I don&#039;t think flossing changed them from red  (inflamed) to pink (not inflamed).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Leslie, I have not compared flax seeds to chia seeds. Flax seeds are much easier to get. When I&#039;m in Beijing,  I rarely eat fatty fish. I first discovered that flaxseed oil (just a few capsules) improved my balance when I was in Berkeley. At the time I ate fatty fish (salmon) regularly, once or twice/week. My initial observation was that a relatively small amount (by my current standards) of flaxseed oil noticeably improved my balance (measured by how easily I could put on my shoes while standing). Eating fatty fish (or anything else) had never done that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once again, add me to the list of people who find that 2-3 tablespoons of flax seed oil a day improves both my gums and joint pain. 

I suffer intermittent knee, hip and now shoulder joint pain and find after doing a few days on and then a few days off consuming the flax seed oil that there is substantially less pain when I take it. And yes bending down and picking something up is a much less painful experience when I&#039;ve been doing the oil. I don&#039;t like the taste of the oil and don&#039;t want to, since I also use it as weak-tasting calories in my weight loss efforts. I swallow it quickly in water with my tongue outside (under) the glass and immediately drink some strong green tea afterwards to mask the taste. It is work to do this, but well worth it... 

Onwards with more self experimentation! Pooling the efforts of even a small number of self experimenters, we seem to be able to come up with a lot of solutions to problems that high falutin scientists are blind to.]]></description>
