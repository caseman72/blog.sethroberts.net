		<description><![CDATA[I have had some experience with the medical system here in China. I work in a small international hospital in Shanghai which is clean and modern, but quite expensive. The standards we follow are often much higher than the standards imposed by the Chinese govt.

On vacation in Yellow Mountain (Huang Shan / ??) my girlfriend came down with pneumonia. We ended up going to a local, Chinese hospital. The doctor told her she would have to stay overnight in the hospital for 14 days while getting IV antibiotics. As a pharmacist trained in the US, I knew this was absolutely not true. In the US, she could easily receive oral antibiotics and be treated on an outpatient basis. Due to the language barrier, I had a hard time communicating this to the doctor, but the doctor apparently said something to the effect of, the drugs in China are not the same as the drugs in the US, we have to use IV here.

I don&#039;t believe this at all. I asked one of my co-workers, who is also a pharmacist and whose mother works for a local hospital in Shanghai. She said doctors will try to get any patients they can to stay overnight in the hospital and to get IV fluids and/or antibiotics, because they make &quot;grey money&quot;. I&#039;m not sure exactly what she meant by that, but it sounds to me like a case of doctors&#039; greed influencing their treatment of patients, leading them to choose unnecessary and inconvenient treatments over equally effective and convenient ones.

Staying overnight in a Chinese hospital is about the last thing anyone would want to do. Many of the patients are not well educated and will spit on the floor and smoke in the beds right next to you. In the hospital we visited, there were people vomiting into trashcans and no cleaning service to tidy it up afterward. I witnessed an old man pull his IV out by accident and get blood all over the floor. It was there for at least 2 hours. I never saw anyone come to clean it up.

We ended up gritting our teeth and coming in once a day for about 10 days to get IV antibiotics. We eventually managed to purchase some oral antibiotics (without a prescription) at a local pharmacy outside the hospital. My girlfriend&#039;s pneumonia cleared up and we haven&#039;t had any problems since.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim, I do not remember posting  &quot;research finding that more than half of Tsinghua professors fabricate or falsify data.&quot; On the other hand, the same student who told me about bad Chinese doctors has two university professors as parents. Her parents told her not to become a professor because of the &quot;darkness&quot; of Chinese academia. The big problem, said her parents, was what you say: fabrication and falsification of data, including plagiarism.

A recent paper by John Ioannidis and a Chinese co-author likewise suggested a large problem with data fabrication among papers from China.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
What you seem to be describing is Western-style medicine being practiced in China. Usually when referring to &#039;Chinese medicine&#039; one means &#039;Traditional&#039; Chinese medicine (TCM) which is the use of herbs, acupuncture, tuina massage and moxibustion, but primarily herbs. Chinese herbal medicine has been developed over more than 2000 years and is an awesome form of medicine when practiced by a qualified practitioner. My understanding is that although herbalism is practiced in some hospitals, the primary mode of health care in China is the Western style allopathic medicine and that TCM is a struggling if not dying modality.

I&#039;m not surprised that your story paints a poor picture of the Chinese medical &#039;system&#039;. I hope that readers don&#039;t associate this negatively with TCM.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A pretty horrifying picture of Chinese doctors! Is this just a reflection of mass corruption among Chinese authorities? Did you post research finding that more than half of Tsinghua professors fabricate or falsify data? 

One point: My understanding is that the experiments with &quot;sham&quot; acupuncture where you don&#039;t actually let the needles enter the skin but the person feels a bit of pinching finally offered a control. The research strongly shows that whatever is giving the (rather small) positive effects of acupuncture, it&#039;s not the needles puncturing the skin, since sham acupuncture got effects as good as the real thing. It is clear that people get some relaxation from acupuncture, most likely an endorphin rush from the needles, and that this can be taken away by an endorphin blocker, Naltrexone.]]></description>
