		<description><![CDATA[Hi Professor Roberts,

I understand you are conducting the butter experiment for cognitive results.  
I was wondering if you are self reporting any physical changes or noting any trends in blood work completed.  Also, in conjunction with the butter what is the quantity of other fats you consume daily? (I am assuming you are still take a couple of tablespoons of ELOO)

Thank you for your time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, Just a note from the other side of the pond. I wondered how you ate &#039;half a stick&#039; of butter a day as I eat loads of butter but would struggle to eat half a &#039;stick&#039;. Now that I see the 60g measure it all becomes clear! In the UK a &#039;stick&#039; of butter is 250g. I often make scrambled eggs with 30-50g butter as a way to get a good dosing per day.  I am going to try the melted butter in tea (and hot chocolate) idea and see how it tastes - thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I have had a casual interest in trying this for a while, but I hadn&#039;t figured out how to consume that much butter.

*You can eat it like soup.*

...did the trick!

I just &quot;souped&quot; half a stick of regular grocery store butter. I found it to taste *extremely* salty--much more so than eating it as a solid.

Do you use salted or unsalted butter?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Seth, great discoveries. But, what about  the cream? Is it not supposed to be the same type of  fat as the butter? As I use to cook with butter and have cream on sauces and coffee this is an important question to know as to define how much milk fat I take during the day and its effects. Thanks¡]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I have begun to employ your idea of consuming 1/4 or more stick of butter and have concluded there is great merit to doing this, if for no other reason than that it supplies the body with some healthy saturated fat.  It&#039;s also a great quick snack when melted in a cup in a microwave oven and topped with some grated parmeson cheese.  You can eat it like soup.  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;In addition to butter, do you regularly consume oils (that is, when you’re not experimenting).&lt;/em&gt;

I regularly consume flax seeds, due to their high omega-3 content. The omega-3 is entirely in the oil. Whether flax seeds are a better source of omega-3 than flaxseed oil I don&#039;t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;The easiest theory is that speed + accuracy is related to underlying arousal. (baseline arousal, potential arousal change). In which case it is hard to know which one is better slower or faster. &lt;/em&gt;

Increasing arousal does not make one faster at the same level of accuracy. It pushes you down (toward lower accuracy and greater speed) on a speed-accuracy tradeoff function. I observed that more butter made me faster at the same level of accuracy. Contradicting your theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;do you think that the effects of the Land o’Lakes butter are just as strong as with the premium (pastured) butter?&lt;/em&gt;

Yes. I have switched between expensive and cheaper butters several times and never noticed a difference. Doing yet another test isn&#039;t very attractive because there are too many things that are more likely to have an effect, such as sodium butyrate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Stephen over at whole health source seems to be suggesting that butters healthful properties come from its buytrate content - http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2009/12/butyric-acid-ancient-controller-of.html

I wonder if it is also responsible for its mind enhancing properties as well. Buytrate supplements are fairly readily available, maybe its time for Butter Mind 3!

Let me know what you think.
