		<description><![CDATA[@ Joseph B. who on 11/28 said in part re Vitamin D: &quot;...I don&#039;t know if it was building up soybean oil from these pills (I&#039;m fat intolerant)...

Joseph, you should not use a capsule of anything that contains soybean oil as the excipient because it is basically a trans fat slurry and, like all trans fats is pro-inflammatory.  There are plenty of D3 capsule formulations available that use better fats such as sunflower or safflower oil.  Or you can buy the dry tablet version of D3 and just take it with a tablespoon of light olive oil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;So let me get this straight: if I typically wake up at 7am and the sun rises at 9am [1], you recommend to take the dose at 9am?&lt;/em&gt;

No, I do not mean to be that precise. I am trying to say: 1. A few hours can make a big difference, because changing morning light exposure by a few hours can make a big difference. 2. Start with early morning (e.g., 7 am) rather than late morning (e.g., 11 am).  

And vary when you take by a few hours to assess the effect of a variety of times. It may have no effect at 8 am but a big effect at 6 am.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hej Jarno,
I was going to ask the same question because I live in Sweden, and in winter we have to go to work etc well before the sun rises, so it was not clear whether to take the Vit D on waking or at sunrise.

But I guess a Finn asked the question first.
