		<description><![CDATA[To continue our discussion: I have had dealings with superior, arrogant doctors, and doctors who didn&#039;t give a damn, and doctors who were sadists (OB/GYN seems to attract those, both male and female). I am very glad to now have a doctor who actually listens, who can admit she&#039;s wrong, and who is willing to learn.

The statin episode happened before I was well enough informed to suggest that my husband ask for evidence; I would be pushier now.

I think our doctor, like most of them, is battling patient expectations. She was delighted (and surprised) that my husband was perfectly willing to make dietary and life-style changes. 

I think many patients come in demanding Celebrex or Lipitor or whatever was advertised on TV last night. I think many more feel that the doctor is not doing his/her job if they don&#039;t come away with at least one prescription.

At one point our doctor advised me to &quot;take Tylenol or Advil,&quot; and I told her I would not, because of the side effects; if I needed an anti-inflammatory or an OTC painkiller I preferred aspirin.

She answered at once that of course I was absolutely right; aspirin is much better! But most people nowadays think it&#039;s old-fashioned or has been superseded somehow. So she doesn&#039;t suggest it.  

I guess doctors too get tired of doing the King Canute thing. I&#039;m just glad that I can challenge ours and have a thoughtful, reasoned discussion of what matters to me.]]></description>
