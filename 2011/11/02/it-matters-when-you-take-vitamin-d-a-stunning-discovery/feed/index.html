		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;I’ve been having massive insomnia, but it has been sporadic…or so I thought.

Within the past month there have been 5 cases of insomnia. Onset of sleep has varied. Waking time has remained constant.

D3 late at night (one hour prior bed) has been the only tracked variable that I have to point to and test. The D3 dosage has also been varied. I have yet to test but found it interesting to say the least.&lt;/em&gt;

I hope you will comment here to say what happens when you change the time you take your Vitamin D.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jim, I&#039;m confused as to if you&#039;ve made huge lifestyle changes before and gotten miraculous results through them why you still can&#039;t kick the binge eating!

You should check out Tim Ferris&#039; book 4-Hour Body. His plan is very close to a paleolithic diet, but with very low glycemic index foods, and will lower your blood sugar - and you can still eat wings, just not fried in peanut oil! I think that book would be a good one for you because there is one set binge day a week.

Check out the book by Eric Braverman, The Edge Effect. There&#039;s a test in there for your neurotransmitter balance. Supplementing certain amino acids can help balance your brain chemistry and help curb your desire to eat compulsively.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth!

It is my personal experience as well as observations that vitamin D in the evening disrupts awakening or sleep for some, so I generally always take it &lt; 12-3pm unless I am sick (in which case if I am coming down with a cold, it doesn&#039;t matter and I sleep well despite the timing of the dosage). 

Is this story from Tara at http://primalgirl.wordpress.com/? The link above didn&#039;t work right for me?




Jim Purdy,

Awesome story and biohacking!  Do you check your BGs frequently (20, 40, 60, 120 min after meals and fasting)?  Protein/amino acids and their timing make profound changes on hormones, growth hormone, sex hormones, insulin/glucagon and leptin.  

Sounds like to me that you have lingering insulin resistance issues. Do the food cravings persist despite eating 50 grams protein in the AM + 15-30 grams carbs in the morning?  Have you considered the value of 5HTP or L-tryptophan in the morning for cravings? Often these are deficient with leaky gut/intestinal permeability.  Would love to hear your progress.

		<description><![CDATA[I hope Seth doesn&#039;t get upset with me for going off topic with his blog, but I really appreciate everybody&#039;s input. And, actually, I only gave a very short version of my situation. Here are a few more details:

1. THE LEG THAT HAD TO BE AMPUTATED -- BUT I REFUSED
In early 2010, doctors told me that my right foot had a very bad diabetic ulcer, and that the leg had to be amputated. Being non-compliant, I did not have the amputation, and I went to work on exercise, especially walking up stairs. RESULT: I still have my leg, and it has healed just fine.

2. THE HEART ATTACK THAT WAS MOMENTS AWAY AND REQUIRED QUADRUPLE BYPASSES -- BUT I REFUSED
In the summer of 2010, cardiologists rushed me straight to a heart hospital because they said I needed emergency quadruple bypasses for had badly blocked coronary arteries and that I could die of a heart attack at any moment. I did not have the bypasses, and I relied on exercise and diet changes. RESULT: I exercise regularly now, and I no longer have any chest pains at all.

3. THE KIDNEYS THAT WERE FAILING AND WOULD SOON NEED DIALYSIS -- BUT NOW THEY ARE FINE
For a few years, doctors have said my kidneys were failing and that I would eventually need dialysis unless I too lots of BigPharma chemicals. I felt that the chemicals would actually be more of a burden on my kidneys and liver, and I didn&#039;t take any of them. RESULT: On my most recent lab work, my kidneys are just fine.

4. MY ONLY REMAINING BIG HEALTH ISSUE -- MY HIGH DIABETIC BLOOD SUGARS
Since all my other health issues have improved greatly with lifestyle changes, I am fully confident that the right lifestyle adjustments can control my diabetes. Interestingly, when I asked for advice from Seth Roberts and Jenny Ruhl (of Diabetes Update), they gave me very different responses. Seth recommended exercise, which is indeed what I am working on now in a brand-new exercise room in my apartment building. Jenny had only one suggestion: insulin. I &#039;m going to go with Seth over Jenny. Exercise has worked for our evolutionary ancestors for many millions of years, but BigPharma&#039;s injected insulin has only been around since 1921. I&#039;ll take my chances with millions of years of evolution, over 90 years of BigPharma lab products.

Sorry for the distraction, Seth, but I really appreciate the input here.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope Seth doesn&#8217;t get upset with me for going off topic with his blog, but I really appreciate everybody&#8217;s input. And, actually, I only gave a very short version of my situation. Here are a few more details:</p>
<p>1. THE LEG THAT HAD TO BE AMPUTATED &#8212; BUT I REFUSED<br />
In early 2010, doctors told me that my right foot had a very bad diabetic ulcer, and that the leg had to be amputated. Being non-compliant, I did not have the amputation, and I went to work on exercise, especially walking up stairs. RESULT: I still have my leg, and it has healed just fine.</p>
<p>2. THE HEART ATTACK THAT WAS MOMENTS AWAY AND REQUIRED QUADRUPLE BYPASSES &#8212; BUT I REFUSED<br />
In the summer of 2010, cardiologists rushed me straight to a heart hospital because they said I needed emergency quadruple bypasses for had badly blocked coronary arteries and that I could die of a heart attack at any moment. I did not have the bypasses, and I relied on exercise and diet changes. RESULT: I exercise regularly now, and I no longer have any chest pains at all.</p>
<p>3. THE KIDNEYS THAT WERE FAILING AND WOULD SOON NEED DIALYSIS &#8212; BUT NOW THEY ARE FINE<br />
For a few years, doctors have said my kidneys were failing and that I would eventually need dialysis unless I too lots of BigPharma chemicals. I felt that the chemicals would actually be more of a burden on my kidneys and liver, and I didn&#8217;t take any of them. RESULT: On my most recent lab work, my kidneys are just fine.</p>
<p>4. MY ONLY REMAINING BIG HEALTH ISSUE &#8212; MY HIGH DIABETIC BLOOD SUGARS<br />
Since all my other health issues have improved greatly with lifestyle changes, I am fully confident that the right lifestyle adjustments can control my diabetes. Interestingly, when I asked for advice from Seth Roberts and Jenny Ruhl (of Diabetes Update), they gave me very different responses. Seth recommended exercise, which is indeed what I am working on now in a brand-new exercise room in my apartment building. Jenny had only one suggestion: insulin. I &#8216;m going to go with Seth over Jenny. Exercise has worked for our evolutionary ancestors for many millions of years, but BigPharma&#8217;s injected insulin has only been around since 1921. I&#8217;ll take my chances with millions of years of evolution, over 90 years of BigPharma lab products.</p>
<p>Sorry for the distraction, Seth, but I really appreciate the input here.</p>
