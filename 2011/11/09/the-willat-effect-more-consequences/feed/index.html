		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t write down impressions, but I remember them. Smooth is better than rough, not bitter is better than bitter. Full is better than sharp or jagged. Perhaps what I call full other people would call rich. You&#039;re certainly right that I notice more than which tastes better: I can always say why (e.g., &quot;A tastes fuller than B&quot;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tonight I tried a new box of peppermint tea.  I brewed just from this new tea,  without a comparison cup which would have been brewed using my current favorite boxed peppermint tea.  I think of it as a tasting where the comparison is done in memory.  (I think it&#039;s valid but not as good as having them both available in real time.) I found myself describing this tea as &#039;fresh, has two sharp edges, a smooth mint flavor, fades well&#039;.  Which, I agree, sounds annoyingly like those wine snobs.

Which made me curious as to whether you record impressions during your black tea tastings (&#039;malty&#039;, &#039;bitter&#039;, &#039;rich&#039;), or if you are interested solely in the winner?  And if you capture impressions, have you noticed any patterns, or whether one way to describe is better than another?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This film connoisseur is a good example of your observation that connoisseurs are less demanding of conventional perfection:

http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2011/11/11/william_monahan_picks_his_favorite_british_crime_films.html

After the dogs of memory had had a few days to hunt around, I realized that I&#039;d heard this observation some 30 years ago at an AAAS talk by computer game designer Chris Crawford. He talked about candy, comic books, and computer games. In the first two cases, one expects that a small child will grow out of a predilection for simple confections and wish to experience more complicated flavors (spicy!) and may eventually become a gourmand, who eats some things that really taste _bad_. Crawford was largely expressing a hope that the level of connoisseurship and sophistication we see in cuisine and literature might come someday to computer games.

		<description><![CDATA[Elizabeth, I suppose our sense of beauty started with mate assessment. Our distant ancestors, including primates, preferred more symmetrical less damaged mates. But in humans this sort of assessment, at least applied to objects, has gotten much more complicated and powerful, I believe. In other words, whether something (not somebody) is beautiful or not plays a much bigger part in our lives than it does in the life of any (other) animal. The evolutionary purpose of this great expansion of a sense of beauty happened because it caused resources to be given to highly-skilled artisans -- the ones who can make the most beautiful things. These resources increased technological innovation. Here I&#039;m talking about visual beauty. I believe our appreciation of auditory &quot;beauty&quot; (music) came about because it caused the same thing: resources going to those who could make the best-sounding instruments. Who were the most skilled artisans, etc.

Perhaps the word &quot;beauty&quot; (what might be called the idea) was invented to describe the more attractive objects. Since many animals choose mates based on appearance, it isn&#039;t clear what it means to say the idea of beauty was &quot;invented&quot;.  It&#039;s like asking who invented hunger.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;My question is, where does “our enjoyment of beautiful objects” come in? How did that originate? What is its evolutionary benefit? &quot;

Beauty seems like a pretty basic &#039;moving towards&#039; valuation. So, we want to be around or look at things that are beautiful, and presumably these things tend to be good for us.

When it comes to art, it seems more like we&#039;re recreating the experience of natural patterns or events ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Elizabeth, I think connoisseurship was evolutionarily beneficial because it increased innovation. It increased innovation because it made it easier to make a living as a highly-skilled artisan. People with such jobs produce more technological innovation than people with other jobs. Basically connoisseurship raised their salary. Our enjoyment of beautiful objects, and willingness to pay more for them than similar but less attractive objects (e.g., decorated cup versus undecorated cup) likewise increased technological innovation. It caused innovation in decoration, which was a stepping stone to innovation in obviously useful stuff (e.g., better weapons).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

I have not been as diligent and methodical as you. However, I have meandered my way into being very bitchy about how my tea is prepared from experimentation and toying around.

1) Like you mentioned with black tea, I have consistently, across all forms of tea or tisanes, preferred less steeping than is suggested, and this is one of the most important factors as to whether the tea is tolerable (to me).
2) Whenever possible, I make tea in french presses so the leaves have plenty of room to move around. When the tea is finished steeping, I transfer the tea to another vessel. I also have a single cup+infuser for traveling, and spent a while finding a brand with an infuser I liked (holes were small enough to accomodate tisanes with small leaves, infuser was almost the entire size of the cup -- FORLIFE). As my main, I use a double-walled steel french press to preserve the temperature during steeping.
3) I pour the tea into either small cups (3.5oz) or halfway into larger cups (6oz) so that I can finish the cup while the tea is at a temperature I like. Rest is stored in a thermos.
4) Bagged tea is always terrible, unless it is luxury (fancy infusers, whole leaves) bagged tea where the prices are ridiculous. Fortunately, quality loose tea is very competitively priced to cheap bagged tea.

I still have many questions and curiosities and things I&#039;ll hope to figure out. For example, the samovar method of tea is common in some cultures and makes some delicious tea, at least black tea, but involves oversteeping and then diluting this oversteeped tea with hot water. Does the temperature of the water matter? Does giving a short pre-soak in cold water help? Does storing or serving the tea in metal vs. glass vs. ceramic matter? Steeping in cast iron vs. clay vs. glass ?

My conclusion has been similar to yours -- figuring these things out may not necessarily be the right way, but they&#039;re the right way for me and gives me pleasure when I&#039;m enjoying my hobby later. The only frustrating thing is, like you mentioned with the liners, you realize you want a product to solve your problem that doesn&#039;t exist yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Jazi

Several months ago I started drinking peppermint tea after supper.  I agree with your observation that there&#039;s a huge difference between brands.  I&#039;m about ready to throw out one brand because the tea tastes stale.  

Also, I hadn&#039;t thought about brewing for just one minute; I&#039;ll give it a test tonight.

@Seth

Another advantage to Upton&#039;s is that you can order samples for about a dollar each.

<p>Several months ago I started drinking peppermint tea after supper.  I agree with your observation that there&#8217;s a huge difference between brands.  I&#8217;m about ready to throw out one brand because the tea tastes stale.  </p>
<p>Also, I hadn&#8217;t thought about brewing for just one minute; I&#8217;ll give it a test tonight.</p>

<p>Another advantage to Upton&#8217;s is that you can order samples for about a dollar each.  That&#8217;s what I did in my first several orders, several dozen samples in each order, and then did a bake-off between them.  The smart thing I did at the time was to start a spreadsheet to track my ratings and reactions.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I drink only mint tea.

I always noticed
1) exactly one minute is great. 15 more seconds makes it ugly. Not nice in stomach, and not tasty.

I also noticed a huge difference between brands. It was hard to believe, but it was too clear to neglect.


2) i used sweeteners.
2.1) only one sweetener ( a mixture of aspartam and saccarine) was good in my sensitive stomach. I would run to other stores to find it and gather an inventory.
2.2) it was exactly half a ball of sweetener that was great. No more. No less....


I thoughts i am crazy or fantasizing. But i knew i am right

It comes together with many other things that I gave up my eyes because there was no theory, and common opinion were not accepting my eyes.
No more blindness! What I See Is What I Believe]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Are [I] brewing the Choco Late at a constant 185 degrees for 30 minutes?&quot; No. The water cools. Maybe I could get better results if I kept the water hot but that would be difficult. I have done that with a microwave and temperature probe -- brewed chai at constant temperature for 80 minutes.
