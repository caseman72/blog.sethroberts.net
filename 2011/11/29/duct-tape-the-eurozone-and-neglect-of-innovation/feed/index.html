Today I received one video from a bunch of guys who tested whether appliances actually stop bullets like they do in the movies (hint: they don&#039;t.  None of them will do particularly well on the written final, but they successfully carried out a piece of independent research and discovered something useful about their world on their own.  That&#039;s worth a lot.

BTW, have you tried &quot;contract grading,&quot; where you give students a menu of varied assignment choices/styles for them to individually pick from?]]></description>

That would mean a drastic reduction in the financial sector, which makes up a large chunk of GDP of many developed countries. 

Of course, the fact that a lot of money is spent on financial services instead of elsewhere (mal-investment!) is ignored.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;I think the best model is that of a Ponzi scheme.&lt;/em&gt;

I think your idea is good. Why was Madoff so successful? Because people (investors) were encouraged to be ignorant and passive. To fail to understand. To fail to ask. That was normal. Madoff was not only one who profitted -- the whole financial industry profitted. As you say.  Yet the reporting about Madoff blamed Madoff (and the SEC). The broader culture (the encouragement of ignorance and passivity -- reliance on experts) was never criticized, at least in what I read.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A lot of people have trouble getting their heads around these recurring financial problems, their causes and potential remedies.  Obviously a complex system can be viewed in different ways, using various simplified models to try to understand it.  Incorrect models do not lead to useful insight.

I think the best model is that of a Ponzi scheme.

In a Ponzi scheme, you will generally see the scheme operator offer complex-appearing and opaque investment vehicles to the Ponzi investors.  The early investors get generous returns, the Ponzi operators pay themselves very well, but at some point the money is gone and all remaining &quot;investors&quot; holdings are worthless.

A Ponzi operator can simply sit on the money, like Madoff, or actually make risky investments with it, claiming to the &quot;investors&quot; that the investments are not as risky as they actually are.

In the ongoing banking &quot;crisis&quot;, you have seen the investment banks offer complex investment vehicles with great returns for early investors, take a generous cut for themselves, then suddenly, all of the &quot;investments&quot; are worth nothing or next to nothing.

The challenge for the investment banks has been to get the governments of the world to purchase, in one way or another, these &quot;investments&quot; and give them large sums of money to keep the scheme running longer.

Viewing the events using this model, the remedies to avoid future &quot;banking failures&quot; are simple.  Ban all &quot;investment vehicles&quot; except savings accounts, company stocks, bonds, and simple mortgages.  Keep the banking reserve requirements robust.  In addition, and this is how this links to the Euro discussion, make sure every country has their own currency.

Something along these lines was done after the 1929-1933 crisis.  It does not look it will happen this time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice article. It&#039;s good to see people arguing against &quot;there is no alternative&quot;.

Interesting also, that people, who profit from the status quo have no shame arguing (threatening) with war.

I have borrowed $x, which I am unable to repay because I chronically spend more than I earn. So if I borrow more that will &quot;solve&quot; things? 

My 8 year old knows better.

My blog and twitter feed at www.aquatic-ape-diet.com is an example of an exo-self geared for max idea generation.

It is not just idea generation that counts - it&#039;s idea capture, processing, development, and feedback.
