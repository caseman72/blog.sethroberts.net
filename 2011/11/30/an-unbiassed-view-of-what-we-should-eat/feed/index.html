		<description><![CDATA[Eggs are notable for both choline and a high methionine-to-other amino acids profile. The thing about choline is that it&#039;s really hard to get enough of it from anything but eggs. Methionine is easier to come by. However, there may be some evidence to support that amino acid balance is almost more important than the old &quot;complete protein&quot; model. I&#039;m saying this as a person who has speculated that *less* methionine might be healthier than more, but regardless of my personal opinion, Mr. T apparently liked something known to be pretty high in methionine, so I guess it&#039;s his word against mine.

		<description><![CDATA[I am not a very good researcher, and, frustratingly, I&#039;ve not been able to find any documentation, so the following is produced from my possibly (very) sketchy memory.

Shortly after World War II, Dr. Clara Baker (?) conducted a nutrition experiment in the Chicago (?) area. She recruited 100 (?) babies who had never tasted anything but breast milk. 

Three (?) times a day the babies were set before an array of little dishes containing cereals, custards, scrambled eggs, and many kinds of pureed fruits, vegetables, and meats.

If the baby stuck its fist into a dish and tried to lick it off, the attendant was allowed to feed the baby one bite of that food..

At the end of the experiment (six months?), Dr. Baker determined that although the babies&#039; day-to-day intake was not necessarily nutritionally sound (e.g. nothing but mashed banana for two days), their diets were perfectly nutritionally balanced over the long term, better balanced than the diets of a control group fed by a nutritionist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scrambled eggs are a mixture of fat and protein, same as the rat&#039;s two other favorite dishes.  Now, if he preferred scrambled eggs to fried eggs, for example, that would be a conundrum.  Was that the case?  Saving the bread shows that he knows that bread will remain edible even though it is stale, while foods rich in protein and fat are likely to rot and make him sick if he doesn&#039;t eat them quickly.  Since he doesn&#039;t lack for food, he didn&#039;t need to touch the stored bread.  I bet if they didn&#039;t feed him for a day or two he would have gone back to the bread and congratulated himself on his wisdom in planning for the rainy day.  But as for the aversion to yogurt, I don&#039;t have a clue.  Could it have been tarted up with fruit or jam?]]></description>
