		<description><![CDATA[Evidence-based medicine is an improvement if you compare it not to innovation, but to doing the same thing that has always been done even when that practice does not actually work that well. That is usually what evidence-based medicine is compared to, and that is where the push for evidence-based medicine is coming from. It&#039;s not the practitioners pioneering new treatments who are viewed as a problem here, so much as the medical &quot;wisdom&quot; that is unstintingly followed, even when it turns out that it&#039;s not so wise after all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Didn’t you just the other day request that doctors always provide you data with evidence that their treatment works?&lt;/em&gt;

Not quite. I said it was always a good idea to ask for data. If the doctor has no data, fine, now you know. If the doctor has anecdotal data, fine, now you know. The problem with evidence-based medicine is not the emphasis on evidence, it is the emphasis on being an evidence snob. Asking for evidence, to be perfectly clear, is not the same as being an evidence snob. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Wolcott interview you cited has profound implications for diabetics. This statement was particularly meaningful to me:

&quot;... a small cut or sore can become infected, and flare into a limb- or life-threatening condition in as little as three days. These wounds are so difficult to heal that most of medicine considers them a lost cause and treats them with amputation.&quot;

In early 2010, I was hospitalized while numerous physicians and surgeons said that my right foot had a massive diabetic ulcer and that my leg needed to be amputated immediately or I would die. That didn&#039;t sound to me like a great idea, and I left the hospital after 6 days, even though the doctors said I would be back within a few days in much worse shape, if I didn&#039;t die first.

It took many months, but my leg healed just fine. Over millions of years, our bodies have evolved awesome defenses against illness, but doctors give up too quickly and perform many unnecessary life-changing leg amputations.]]></description>
