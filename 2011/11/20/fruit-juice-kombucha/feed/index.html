		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Heidi. The way you combine fruit and tea to make kombucha reminds me of the lambic beers I like so much. They involve two fermentations: beer and fruit juice. Also the way I got good results from using three fermented sources of flavor in soups: e.g., miso, fermented black bean sauce, and stinky tofu.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I processed the fruit in different ways depending on what it was and the form that I had it in.  For example with the sumac, I steeped the fresh berries in the fridge for 1-4 days.  With wild grapes and autumn olive berries I blended the fresh fruit and poured off the liquid.  The rosehips and elderberries that I had had been dried, so I steeped them in hot water.  The black current and raspberries were part of a green tea blend.  The black cherries I cooked, but if I could find a simple way to remove the pits, I would process them differently.  If possible I tried not to heat the fruit to preserve the vitamin C.  In general I processed the fruit separate from the tea and sugar and then mixed them both together at room temperature.  Occasionally, I steeped dried fruit with the tea and then strained it all off.  

My kombucha brew would be stronger than the weak tea and sugar that is typically recommended.  Different fruits combined better with different kinds of tea.  I always made two different blends at a time, plus I saved a few bottles from a previous batch.  So I did a lot of direct comparisons, and as Seth would say I became a kombucha snob or connoisseur.  

I stockpiled a lot of kombucha in my fridge and stopped brewing it for the winter.  The kombucha SCOBY can just rest dormant for a long time. I gather most of my own fruits.  So it was a labor intensive process.  But I have lots of new ideas and combinations that I want to try next year.  I would be curious to hear what combos other people discover to be exceptionally good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, can you ask Heidi for more-specific instructions?  It&#039;s not clear whether she includes whole fruit/berries with the tea, mashes it the fruit first, squeezes juice out of it, etc.  I&#039;d like to have enough detail to reproduce her kombucha  myself.]]></description>
