		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a good reason you go with the objective tests, though. 
If you have a bunch of thyroid symptoms but normal thyroid levels, most of the time it&#039;s because someone&#039;s made a mistake somewhere and your thyroid&#039;s fine. 

That said, in this case the House solution is perfect. Give &#039;em thyroid stuff and see if they improve. Unlike say, chemo, hormones tend not to have the capacity to cause permanent damage. May as well just try it and see.]]></description>

&quot;Listening to patients?&quot;

Now that&#039;s a concept that I haven&#039;t seen practiced by many doctors. They all seem to be spend my allotted 3-minute visit typing out expensive prescriptions that their computers tell them that my insurance will cover. Meanwhile, they ignore me sitting there telling them that I don&#039;t want any drugs for lifestyle-caused issues like cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar, and that I only want lifestyle advice.

Forget evidence-based medicine, I&#039;m ready to try shoe-based medicine. Maybe I could get a doctor&#039;s attention if I whack them over the head with a shoe.]]></description>
