		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I recently found your book on Amazon while searching for a book to help me improve my sleep . . . just ordered it and can&#039;t wait to start reading it. Very interested to know the principles laid out in the book and will definitely try the diet. Re: vitamin D, i am taking vit D3 with my first meal of the day but when too busy it&#039;s not until noon I get to do it . . . I am wondering if taking it first thing in the morning mean taking it on an empty stomach. Since I can&#039;t eat until around 11-12 noon I wanted to know if it is safe to take Vit D or any other supplement on an empty stomach. Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[lunchtime might be  best? 

J Bone Miner Res. 2010 Apr;25(4):928-30.
Taking vitamin D with the largest meal improves absorption and results in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
Mulligan GB, Licata A.

&quot;Many patients treated for vitamin D deficiency fail to achieve an adequate serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] despite high doses of ergo- or cholecalciferol.&quot; 

&quot;Thus it is concluded that taking vitamin D with the largest meal improves absorption and results in about a 50% increase in serum levels of 25(OH)D levels achieved.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Am I missing something?&quot; Yes. She usually took the Vitamin D in mid afternoon, not night. Unlikely that she slept poorly because her afternoon Vitamin D was interfering with her sleep. It might be true that although she usually took her Vitamin D in the afternoon, perhaps once/week she took it in the evening and that was enough to keep her from getting a high-amplitude (= powerful) circadian rhythm in her sleep/wake oscillator. An oscillator doesn&#039;t require constant (e.g., daily) input to work properly. You don&#039;t have to push a swing every oscillation to make it keep swinging in a big arc. A few pushes at the right time can have a powerful and long lasting effect. A few pushes at the wrong time can be very damaging. So perhaps she was damaging her sleep every night by once/week taking her Vitamin D at night. And once she started doing the right thing (taking her Vitamin D at a favorable time, morning, rather than a neutral time, afternoon) everything started working great. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little confused. I understand the claim to be: Vitamin D first thing in the morning helps you sleep better at night. 

Now here&#039;s the sequence of events as I see it:
1. Primalgirl has been sleeping poorly
2. She was and had been taking Vitamin D3 for a while
3. At night. 
4. She then started taking it first thing in the morning
5. Starts sleeping like a rock

BUT, crucially, she also says: &quot;Days I forgot and skipped the D3, I still slept great.&quot;

So it sounds like the Vitamin D at night was interfering with her sleep, and now it&#039;s been taken away and hence no more interference. If the D3 in the morning was actually helping her sleep better (than baseline) then she should sleep poorly (less better) on the days she skips it. 

Or am I missing something?]]></description>
