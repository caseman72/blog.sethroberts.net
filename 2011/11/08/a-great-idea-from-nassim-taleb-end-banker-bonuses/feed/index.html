		<description><![CDATA[Daniel, thanks for explaining your reasoning. What is your proposal for improving the situation? &quot;Paying for good decisions&quot; strikes me as too vague to be practical. The domain of &quot;good decisions&quot; can be anything. A surgeon would say if a patient survives, that shows the surgeon made &quot;good decisions&quot; during surgery. If a surgeon fails to give patient nutritional advice, is that a good decision, a bad decision, or no decision? If a primary care doctor fails to give nutritional advice, same question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Charging surgeons a fee when a patient dies doesn&#039;t necessarily fix the problem. The problem is simply that the agent (in this case, the surgeon) is incentivized by something other than matching the patient&#039;s intentions, and the system should try to be realigned to make that less the case. A bigger problem that I think of in this case is -- if a surgeon is paid per operation, how is a surgeon supposed to tell you that surgery may not be a good idea?]]></description>
