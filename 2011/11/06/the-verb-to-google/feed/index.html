		<description><![CDATA[American trademark law, as I understand it, does not protect verbs.  Therefore, you and everyone else are welcome to google generically in lower case -- even using Bing if you are not feeling especially pedantic or loyal.  It&#039;s unlikely that &quot;bing&quot; will ever be a verb.  MS should be so lucky.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As others have pointed out, genericization is a standard worry for big companies. As a marketing manager of consumer technology products, I&#039;ve sat through long lectures from our lawyers about what usages are and are not permitted. I&#039;m actually surprised that Google (the company) hasn&#039;t cracked down on &quot;to google&quot; a lot more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not modesty...they can lose their trademark if they can&#039;t show that they
actively protect it by correcting misuse.

Aspirin is an example of a lost trademark. &quot;Frigidaire&quot; is a mark that is still alive in the U.S. but has been lost in France. Kleenex and Xerox are marks that would be lost if their companies couldn&#039;t show concerted effort to prevent it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a wiki entry explaining Google&#039;s dislike of using the word as a verb:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_%28verb%29

&quot;Fearing the genericizing and potential loss of its trademark, Google has discouraged use of the word as a verb, particularly when used as a synonym for general web searching&quot;

Perhaps Google is getting too big for its own good. Maybe more of us should start using Yahoo and Bing for our googling. :)]]></description>
