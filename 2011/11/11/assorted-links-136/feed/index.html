		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
As for Reams, 
I think it&#039;s mostly anecdotal as far as the human data go, but if you read up on it or read Matt Stone&#039;s posts on it while he was interning there, you&#039;ll see that it&#039;s probably some of the most profound anecdotal data.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the ultimate solution, but having just a few of these measurable quantities like saliva and urine PH and salts and sugars and making thousands of these comparisons and tests over time has produced some fantastic results.

RBTI for humans is based off of RBTI for agriculture and I think the data is more established there.  At least the anecdotal evidence is also just as amazing as people report the tastiest foods of their lives incorporating this methodology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(Off topic...kinda)
Have you looked into Reams Biological Theory of Ionization?  Specifically with a homebase offshooting from Challen Waychoff  and Matt Stone?

It seems it would be an interesting study as there are specific measurements to test against.(?)  I am skeptical (perhaps because of my own bias) because of naturopathy influences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The popularity of a diet has nothing to do with its efficacy, and if one were to look at correlations, it&#039;s almost certainly an inverse relationship. Who would know this better than you!

And anyway, most of the vegans I know consider it an ethical diet, with any health benefits/risks of secondary importance.

I&#039;m a vegetarian myself. I find the paleo diet very interesting and believe may be the most healthy for humans. But I also believe that animal suffering matters, so I do my best to approximate it without the meat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The point about medical tests is valid.

However, in terms of cost control, you&#039;re going to wrack up 75% of the costs in the last six months of life.  A few tests or MRI are wasteful -- but they aren&#039;t what is driving the medical costs.

Most doctors aren&#039;t healers. They are guardians of death. One big exception is  psychiatrists, and like dentists, they should be excluded from most medical plans.]]></description>
