		<description><![CDATA[When I do a non-computer task that counts as work, I just log starting it at my computer, do it, and then log ending it at my computer.

I always found paper to computer transfer difficult and I avoid it as much as possible. I suppose my main tip would be that R is not so hard and you should probably try downloading the workspace and using it. You will need to learn a little bit of R.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been collecting similar data for the past month, but in a paper-based calendar with half-hour granularity. I am then digitizing it at the end of each week and doing some basic analysis (I watched how much TV?!). this has been useful in pinpointing the big areas I need to work on, but I know it is missing out on the minute-to-minute efficiency boost the constant feedback is giving you. I&#039;ve tried direct digital entry before, but it has never stuck for more than a few days. I&#039;m hoping I can slowly make the change from paper in such a way that the habit sticks. Do you have any tips? In particular how do you handle entry when you are away from the computer (if ever ;)? Looking forward to the day I have a system like yours happening - nice work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few commenters on previous posts have asked for the R code for this system. I was going to add my voice to that chorus but then, hubristic programmer that I am, I thought: I could write that myself. Plus I was looking for a little project that would give me some experience with Mac programming. So I&#039;ve spent a bit of time the last few days putting together this: https://github.com/czr/Efficiency

It&#039;s currently extremely rough-and-ready. It lacks some of the features of Seth&#039;s system and contains numerous bugs. Runs on OS X 10.6. Use at own risk, etc.]]></description>
