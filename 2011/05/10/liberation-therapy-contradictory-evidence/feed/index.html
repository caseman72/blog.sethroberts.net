		<description><![CDATA[All this conversation about the right method of taking ultrasound pictures is misleading. The golden standard for finding venous obstructions is old fashioned venography accompanied by IVUS. But it&#039;s the underlying question that matters: Is MS of autoimmune or vascular origin? Under this perspective, Zamboni is hardly the first one to talk about blood flow problems. Putnam, Prineas, Behan, Lumsden and Franz Schelling have almost proven that MS is NOT autoimmune.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If Zamboni were making all this up, I think we would have heard about it from jealous colleagues. I think that is impossible. On the other hand, I think measurement of blood flow in the brain is really difficult thus allowing the opponents to get the results they prefer -- they simply do bad measurements. And since they like the results, they don&#039;t look further. I think the contradictory papers reflect bias. If the scientists who found contradictory results really cared about the question, they would have flown an MS patient in whom Zamboni et al. had detected CCVSI to their lab to make sure they could find CCVSI when it is  present.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been following this debate for some time, and it is apparent that one side, or the other side, is lying.

The theory that the proponents of liberation therapy are telling the truth involves more liars and a larger conspiracy than the theory that the opponents of liberation therapy are telling the truth.

On the other hand, it seems obvious to me that those producing evidence against liberation therapy were committed to getting the results that they got, before they got these results, so I am inclined to think that liberation therapy does work, and its critics are lying, even though this theory requires a larger and more evil conspiracy than the converse theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JeffR, a vast number of people (millions?) have taken Zamboni&#039;s results seriously. That&#039;s what makes it newsworthy. Were they all fooled? Or did the non-replicating research teams do a poor job? 

Why this disagreement shows &quot;the importance of controlled studies or observational studies with n&gt;1&quot; I don&#039;t understand. Both sides of this disagreement have such studies. To persuasively criticize self-experimentation, you need to point to self-experimental conclusions that turned out to be wrong. This is unrelated to that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife has multiple sclerosis and she has been evaluated by Dr. Michael Dake, a U.S. colleague of Zamboni&#039;s, for possible evidence of CCSVI.  We&#039;ll find out the results next week.

I too am struck by the stark differences in these different studies and am obviously determined to get to the bottom of what might explain the diametrically opposed conclusions.  At this point, I have two hypotheses: (1) Zamboni&#039;s diagnostic method was not truly &quot;blind&quot; but involved an element of looking for what he wanted to see; (2) the diagnosis is objective and &quot;blind&quot;, yet complex and subtle, and the measurement of &quot;blood flow&quot; is sensitive to the particular parameters used or to control of possible interfering factors -- so that only those with the right technique or understanding can make the correct diagnosis.  This second possibility is not uncommon in science -- analytical methods are often riddled with artifacts or uncontrolled variables that mess up the analysis if you are not experienced.  I&#039;m hoping that the explanation is #2, but I&#039;m realistic enough to realize it could be #1.  And my wife and I don&#039;t want to take any chances on a procedure which is based upon a faulty hypothesis or wishful thinking.

		<description><![CDATA[How &quot;highly newsworthy&quot; this is depends on how much Zamboni isn&#039;t a crackpot.  

If it turns out liberation therapy is bunk, then of course we would expect results like Doepp&#039;s.  And the studies in support of Zamboni were wishful thinking, perhaps consciously, perhaps not.

This is precisely why controlled studies or observational studies with n&gt;1 are so important.  Anecdotes are fine for generating hypothesis but I&#039;m always concerned with your (Seth&#039;s) enthusiasm for their results.  Especially when this runs counter to what people in biology or public health are saying.  Being right about some things discovered with self experimentation (probiotics, acne?) doesn&#039;t mean every self experimenter has discovered a medical breakthrough. 

p.s. I haven&#039;t read any of the papers.]]></description>
