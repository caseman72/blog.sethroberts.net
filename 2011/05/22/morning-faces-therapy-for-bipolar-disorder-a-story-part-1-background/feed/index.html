		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

For the last few weeks, I have been looking for more efficient ways to add faces to my morning.  I tried the bloggingheads (without sound) but I wasn&#039;t thrilled with the result.  Then I came across picasa.  I have been using picasa&#039;s face recognition to catalog my family&#039;s pictures and once I had them all tagged by the face that was in the picture, I could easily create slideshows.  Then, after uploading them all to the web, I started using a web browser and running slide shows as more convienent.  But now I just run a generic slideshow of all the faces on picasa.  I never see the same slideshow twice and I can run it as long as I want.]]></description>
