		<description><![CDATA[I do think &quot;stuff of Seth&quot; is a phrase that will have legs...

This material interests me because I expect some day in the middle distance to look at retirement-and-beyond housing programs. I notice that the most well-regarded place in my city has excellent dinners, but people are on their own for breakfast and lunch. It strikes me that if I moved there -- or elsewhere -- I would try to spearhead a cadre to have breakfast together, even if they are not a natural seamless social group otherwise. (Fortunately I enjoy cooking and serving simple meals.) The retirement programs sponsor lots of social features for the apparent purpose of keeping depression at bay; but not in the relatively early morning. 

In fact, I now think I will keep my ear to the ground in my current homeowner&#039;s association for a chance to set up something. And do some very simple kind of record-keeping of the results.

Here&#039;s to further testing of Stuff of Seth!]]></description>
