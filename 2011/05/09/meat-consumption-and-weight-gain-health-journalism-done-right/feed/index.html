		<description><![CDATA[&quot;That’s astounding. Fifty authors and nobody caught that… Wow.&quot;

With 50 authors, I expect there was a 3- or 4-level hierarchy within the project, and a big budget. So, you can imagine an underling being afraid to criticize his boss and boss&#039;s boss, people he&#039;s unlikely to have collegial relations with. A more senior author (&quot;manager&quot; is perhaps the accurate term) might not want to risk discrediting the whole effort and earning the wrath of his peers (again, people he may not have true collegial relations with).

I wonder if a team of 15 might be more likely to self-correct, since team members (even of different ranks) might be more likely to know and respect one another.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Logical inconsistencies abound in medical literature, don&#039;t they. How bout the cholesterol myth and the fat makes you fat myth. Mark at MDA just posted today about how CLA supplements aren&#039;t beneficial after all. Seriously, the nutritional scientists don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing most of the time.

I think finding a wholly valid, well executed study would be a bigger feat!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Thomas, Agreed! It&#039;s like measuring a bag of nickles to determine how rich you are. Doesn&#039;t matter if they&#039;re real copper-nickle clad nickles or lead-wood fake nickles. Same logic should be levied at standard calculations of BMI which is agnostic to where the weight is coming from, fat versus muscle (it&#039;s both, of course, but the ratio is what really matters and is not determinable from conventional measures).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a good example of how lazy the thinking and methodology of scientists can get once prejudices are well established. Red meat is seen as suspect and weight gain is assumed to be fat mass gain. It would have been nearly as easy to measure change in waist circumference, which would have given a better indication of metabolic risk. The conclusion is applied generally to &quot;weight management&quot;, when all they&#039;re justified in saying is that active people could consider reducing red meat intake if they want to maintain a lower overall body mass. They could also conclude that inactive people shouldn&#039;t worry about their red meat intake&#039;s effect on their mass, but that wouldn&#039;t chime with public health prejudices. The incentive to bolster the public health message appears stronger than the scientific spirit, unfortunately.]]></description>
