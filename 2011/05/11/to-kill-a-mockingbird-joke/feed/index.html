		<description><![CDATA[I liked To Kill A Mockingbird, both the book and the movie. However, over the years I have come to have a more jaundiced view of this type of entertainment, the goal of which seems to be to make white people feel good about themselves. The second half of the 20th century saw an epic struggle for civil rights in this country. Why is it that when this era is portrayed in film, the heroes are always white? Why are the black characters usually so one-dimensional? This continues to the present day in films like The Blind Side, which again portrays affluent white folks coming to the aid of poor blacks. I don&#039;t know, it just seems patronizing. Like the only way black people can get ahead is if a noble white man comes along to help them out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read this book in my quest to read Penguin&#039;s Top 100 Classics. I&#039;m glad I picked this book early on because it set the tone for what I was looking for in a &quot;classic&quot;. Honestly, I can understand why she never wrote again. St. Thomas Aquinas never wrote anything after he had a mystical experience. He said that after God showed him what He had, there was nothing else worth writing.]]></description>
