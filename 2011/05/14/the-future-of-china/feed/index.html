		<description><![CDATA[Awesome. I would love that. You tend to blog a mixture of things that I strongly agree with, right alongside things I strongly disagree with, and I&#039;d love to freely comment without adding &quot;check that blog post&quot; to my agenda.

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a funny point, that Science Fiction is a broad enough genre that it doesn&#039;t always involve anything that has to do with science.

Also, I might comment more if I got an email when comments were made in response. Is this by design?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In American English (and possibly British English as well), &quot;Science Fiction&quot; has been modified sometime in the last 40 years to include what was originally called &quot;Fantasy&quot;.

The scenario you described is a fantasy happening in the future. There&#039;s no element of science (that would make it &quot;science fiction&quot;) - I&#039;m with your students on that one.

Almost every science fiction story has some fantasy, or it wouldn&#039;t be interesting as fiction.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; is pure fantasy - replace the light saber by magical swords and spaceships by dragons and you&#039;re there. On the other hand, most of Asimov&#039;s stories have a scientific element in them.

And there are always stories that defy categorization - such as http://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Man-How-Ate-Father/dp/0679750096 , which some people classify as science fiction, and some as historical fiction although &quot;fiction&quot; is the only descriptive characterization.]]></description>
