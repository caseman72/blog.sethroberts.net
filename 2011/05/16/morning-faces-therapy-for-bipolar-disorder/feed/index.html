		<description><![CDATA[This is a really interesting read. I love reading inspiring stuff like this
I was diagnosed with Bipoalr at the age of 17 and really had a torrid time at School because there was confusion between me just been a moody teen and Bipolar. 
Thankfully mental health is taken more seriously these days and the NHS do a fantastic job. (in the UK)

There is a stigma still attached to mental health issues. its a real shame that in this day and age that this is an issue



For people researching bipolar I write a Blog that is full of my personal experiences and information. I hope you find it useful. Mental Health has positive side that is often overlooked.

		<description><![CDATA[Re the above: with the looming phase-out of the incandescent bulb in favor of of the CFL, one has to wonder if we&#039;re heading into a period of low-level yet omnipresent mental illness (one that may dwarf the effect of the low-fat experiment we&#039;re mired in.)

BTW, Seth, when it comes to &quot;automatically rejected ideas&quot;, you are the thought-leader.  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a very inspiring story. Of course, parts of it are, well, very hard to read. Moving back to Berkeley was quite a move. And the ups and downs, well, all one can say is, More power to you. Do you ever get to a gym? You might look for a tough, and we mean that in terms of discipline, gym atmosphere. Maybe a martial arts type. These things can do wonders. Keep moving forward.]]></description>
