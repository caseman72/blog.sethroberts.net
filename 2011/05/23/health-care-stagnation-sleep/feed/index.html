		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’d say sleep — along with nutrition, weight loss, and a variety of other syndromes — are sub-medical.&quot;  I agree - and a good sign of its sub-medicality is that the Dr. Rudolph&#039;s advice to those with sleep problems is &quot;go to bed and get a good night&#039;s sleep - oh, and don&#039;t have sleep problems.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently discovered that eating fresh spinach helps me sleep quite a bit better, so I&#039;ve started eating spinach salads with dinner.  Without fail, when I wake up the next morning I can tell I had a much deeper sleep than normal.  I&#039;ve never noticed this effect with cooked spinach or frozen spinach, only fresh.

What I&#039;ve read indicates it&#039;s due to the magnesium.  I&#039;ve been meaning to try a magnesium supplement to see if I get the same effect, but haven&#039;t gotten around to it yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[charlie, sleep apnea is one major cause of sleep problems, and while the medical solutions (CPAP etc.) don&#039;t work for everyone, they seem to work very well and safely for a lot of people.

CPAP strikes me as being somewhat in the spirit of Seth&#039;s approach-- I don&#039;t know whether it started with self-experimentation, but it does seem like a fresh, practical look at a problem.]]></description>
