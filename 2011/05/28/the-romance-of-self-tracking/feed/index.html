		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,
You might find the article on this topic at: http://www.psycheducation.org/depression/LightDark.htm to be useful.  We have started using the amber glasses with our daughter who is ultradian cycling bipolar, hoping to reset the circadian rhythm.  You might be interested in the Dark Therapy link on that page.  We are also considering some blue light therapy or a dawn simulator in the winter months (we are in Canada so winter days are short).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you know if the blue blockers were a common &#039;over-the-counter&#039; variety, or medical grade specifically designed to block out the blue wave lengths that can disrupt sleep in the evening?  

I remember years ago trying to find blue blockers specifically made and marketed for the latter, but never could find any so just settled for some amber clip-ons, but I&#039;ve always wondered if there as good as those used in the John Hopkins sleep research where I first got the idea from.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This blue-blocking glasses thing sounds interesting. And it makes totally sense. I have noticed improvements in my sleep by looking in a daylight lamp (the ones against winter depression) throughout the day. And the newest iteration of these lamps does only use blue light. So it is the blue part of the light thats seems to do the job in the eyes. And of course in the evening we want want to avoid simulating it to be midday. So blocking away the blue part might be very helpful (especially when one is looking a lot in computer displays or works in a bright environment). I will definetly try this.]]></description>
