		<description><![CDATA[Karen &amp; Seth - thanks for all! Karen, I&#039;m enjoying the reading material. I just confirmed speaking at TEDxSOMA on the 18th, so it&#039;s going to come in so handy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Seth, I enjoyed reading your QS conference highlights and appreciate the speaking tips. Like @Eri, I wished I had had more time to see all the amazing projects, talks, breakout sessions, etc. I only attended the conference for a couple of hours on Sunday due to illness, so next year&#039;s will be that much more charming.

@Eri, I&#039;ll be posting QS posters online soon. Stay tuned. Two favorites public speaking and presentation blogs are Presentation Zen http://bit.ly/iF30u9 and Speaking about Presenting http://bit.ly/jXziK3 . You might like this tip article, &quot;Uncovering Steve Jobs&#039; Presentation Secrets.&quot; http://buswk.co/jJlsQn Good luck with your talk!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will post Christine&#039;s poster in a few days.

The speaking advice I got isn&#039;t easily summed up. Here is some of it: 1. Have less text on slides. 2. Have more of a punchline for the two slides about Nobel Prizes. 3. Start with a story. 4. Connect what I am saying to my job as a psychology professor. 5. More numbers (data) to support assertions. E.g., number of people using the ketogenic diet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, it was very much like a super-duper QS meetup! I really enjoyed myself and look forward to the next one.

What I didn&#039;t like was not having enough time to see everything! So, thanks for this summary.

I&#039;d really like to check out Christine&#039;s poster. Do you happen to know where there might be a copy online? 

Also, what speaking advice did you receive? (Incidentally, I asked Christine for speaking advice at the conference. I&#039;ll be doing my first keynote at OSCON this summer and wanted her input. I also got great recs!)]]></description>
