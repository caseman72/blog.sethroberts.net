		<description><![CDATA[Exactly the question.  Will the connection between clumsy controlling of the past and Mao&#039;s &quot;power out of the barrel of a gun&quot; be enough to save totalitarian government?

Not a betting man, but my guess would no, but  a lot of dead people in getting there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The article on China is wishful thinking on the part of the writer.  If draconian dialectics were in play, then there should have been a revolution ( a real one, not the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;) during the 1960s when things were MUCH more repressive than they are today.  Of course, there is the phenomenon of &quot;rising expectations&quot; that may seal the CPC&#039;s fate.

Paradoxically, it is the capitalists of the world who don&#039;t really want to see a change in China.  They like the cheap labor and absence of independent trade unions.]]></description>
