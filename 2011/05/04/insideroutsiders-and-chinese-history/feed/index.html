		<description><![CDATA[Actually, I&#039;m surprised a nutrition professor would generalize based on Key&#039;s study of young, active males.  The assumption that 1560 calories will be starvation level calories is not the case, even for those subjects, whose maintenance level was 3200 calories.  Starvation levels were achieved by extreme diet *and* a high level of activity, designed to burn 3000 calories.    By design, they had a 25% weight loss over 6 months.  It must have been hard on his subjects.  IMO, it is a good thing this is the &#039;only&#039; US starvation study.  

There is a great deal of variation in calorie calculators, based on weight, age, gender, and level of activity.  Even conservative calculators over-estimate my 1200 calorie maintenance level.  The nutrition prof would probably call me a liar or a diet cheater, since I&#039;d be gaining weight at her &#039;starvation&#039; level.  Fortunately, my doctor understands that patients are individuals, and people don&#039;t always present as a textbook case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I definitely agree with you. The woman who denounced your diet entirely failed to address the soundness of the supporting theory or data, relying entirely on a superficial view of what the diet was about -- suggesting she hadn&#039;t really read the book. Furthermore, there is nothing in the SLD diet that forces you to eat 1200 kcal/day or any specific amount of calories; the beauty of the diet is that appetite and food intake will spontaneously adjust, and you can continue to eat normal, nutritionally balanced foods.  Starvation means not getting enough nutrients to sustain health, and it may be that a temporary reduction to 1200 kcal/day or even less is fine, as long as you get essential nutrients, especially if you are overweight and losing excess fat.  If you look at Ancel Keys Minnesota Starvation Experiment (see Wikipedia on that) it was far from balanced -- consisting of potatoes, rutabagas, turnips, bread and macaroni -- a diet very poor in protein, fat, essentially fatty acids and minerals.  No wonder the participants lost muscle mass and became food-obsessed and depressed.  SLD is a far cry from the MSE!

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;the only published formal study ever conducted in this country on human starvation (Ancel Keys, 1950)&quot;: set aside the fact that Keys was a crook, what on earth is the import of &quot;in this country&quot;?  Isn&#039;t that carrying American Exceptionalism a little far?]]></description>
