		<description><![CDATA[Interesting.  With all the talk these days about different nutritional properties of different substances, it&#039;s very interesting that you&#039;re getting those good results with standard butter.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;My wife has made either hong shao rou (pork belly cooked in soy sauce) or lu rou fan (pork belly chopped super fine w/ mushrooms and a ton of spice, then boiled for hours) 2x per week for a few weeks now. I’ve eaten more fatty pork in the past few weeks than I’ve ever eaten in my life, but I haven’t noticed any extremely dramatic sleep or brain changes. That said, I don’t track either of these things in any rigorous way at all, although I might start doing so.

Do you think 2x per week is enough to notice something?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No. The effect of pork fat on my sleep lasted just one night. In other words, my sleep Tuesday night depended on how much pork fat I ate on Tuesday, but not Monday. And it takes a considerable amount of pork fat (80 g? 100 g?) to easily notice a difference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe - Congrats on the weight loss! I&#039;ve been vegan for 10+ years, and a couple of years ago I started to crave raw cabbage. I ate copious amounts of vingered quick pickled mexican cole slaw to satisfy those cravings, until I read about ice chewing, and started taking an iron supplement. After that, no more desire to eat huge quantities of raw cabbage. I&#039;m sure it was the same mechanism that drives some people to chew on ice: anemia induced cravings for crunchy things (theorized to resemble chewing on cartilage) - If your cabbage eating was the result of cravings rather than the result of a conscious dietary choice, or if you still have similar cravings, consider an iron supplement. My bloodwork indicated I was at the low end but within the &quot;normal&quot; range of iron, but once I started the supplement, the daily desire to eat raw cabbage completely vanished.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Is there anything specific about the type of butter you eat? I mean, is it raw, pastured-raised, is it sourced locally, is it organic or is it similar to standard (American) pasteurized grocery store butter?&lt;/em&gt;

I&#039;ve tried all sorts of butter, including Amish butter ($11/pound). I have found no difference between the expensive organic pasture-raised butter and the more common Land O&#039;Lakes butter.

		<description><![CDATA[because sharing is caring...In addition to the above details....

I have more or less eliminated all corn/vegetable oils and consume a minimal amount of olive oil. This started when I eliminated wheat. 

I have been supplementing with fish oil 3 to 6 grams daily for several years now (See Dr William Davis&#039;s track you plaque program) 

I have tried SLD using extra light olive oil - didn&#039;t notice a difference in appetite. 

Over 2011, I have tended to avoid lots of raw cabbage (which I used to consume copious amounts)  as it is a goitrogen - haven&#039;t notice difference in weight. 

As far a hunger goes - after wheat the substance that most stimulates my hunger  is Whey Protein powder......]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ouch....you want me to admit how morbidly obese I was?  I am 5&#039; 10&quot; and at my heaviest I was 320 lbs (man that hurts). I am currently at or about 240. I need to lose 40 more pounds. I generally do not track my weight on a daily basis. 

My weight loss has happened in spurts. I lose twenty or so pounds over 6 or 8 weeks period and then more or less stall for a period of time. When I am losing weight I am in the &quot;zone&quot; - meaning that I am:  
a) managing my hunger (as being hungry all the time is stressful)
b) exercising vigorously (circuit training with heavy weights)  
c) I am fasting  (which I have found it the easiest way to eat less calories) 

I actually misspoke - I have been stalled for less than 18 month - more like a year at this point. The last time I lost weight quickly was in Sept/Oct of 2011 when I went for 269 to 250 in about 6 weeks...l have slowly inched down from 250 to 240 during 2011 (after really working out like a dog over the summer).  As I indicated above during 2011 I have been trying different method to control my hunger (the high protein/low carb/low fat diet, fiber supplementation, coconut oil, bcaas)  - none of them really worked.  I have started using butter about 2 or 3 weeks ago and it seems to be doing the trick as it really kills my hunger and makes fasting &quot;do-able&quot; 

Peace,

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Joe, that&#039;s very helpful information. 

Could I ask some more questions? What was your starting weight (before giving up wheat)? How tall are you?

When you say you&#039;ve been &quot;stalled for 18 months&quot;, you mean you want to lose more weight but you haven&#039;t because you get too hungry? At what weight are you stalled?

I understand that eliminating (most) wheat from your diet allowed you to lose 80 pounds. I gather that at some point you started to eat much more butter. When was that? How much butter do you eat? What effect has the butter had on your weight? I understand it has reduced your hunger. But has it also reduced your weight?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What else have you tried? 

In addition to adding butter to my diet I have tried the following: 

1) Elimination of Wheat - very effective. Starting in 2008 - I have mostly eliminated wheat from my diet (not 100% compliant). This has lead to an 80 lbs weight loss. I have been &quot;stalled&quot; for about a 18 months because of can&#039;t seem to manage my hunger. See Dr William Davis&#039;s blog &quot;Wheat Belly&quot; for details. 

2) Vitamin D supplementation. Somewhat effective. I started the Vitamin D supplementation before I eliminated wheat. I don&#039;t recall the effect on my hunger - but made a significant increase in my quality of life. (I am sure I was significantly Vitamin D deficient)  
 
2) Higher Protein/Lower carb/Lower Fat i.e &quot;Body Builder diet&quot; (think veggies and lots of egg whites/chicken breast/pork loin ) Not effective 

3) Fiber supplementation (Oat Bran,  acacia fiber)  - Not Effective

3) Coconut oil - Not particularly effective by itself - seems to work when used with butter.  

4) BCAA supplementation  - Effective (Expensive and inconvenient)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Have you ever experimented with Cream instead of butter? Easy to drink a lot of it.&lt;/em&gt;

No, but I switched from adding half and half to my tea to adding cream. I agree, it&#039;s worth trying. There is a practical problems: In Beijing, where I am now, I cannot get enough cream. I have to go to up-scale supermarkets to get butter. Even those supermarkets don&#039;t have much cream. There is also a theoretical problem: It&#039;s unclear why butter and cream should have different results.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...eat them with nose plugged in the bathroom. Taste is gone in 2 minutes&quot;: one could easily mistake that for some sort of obsessional food puritanism.  Why not just enjoy some butter on your potatoes, on your veggies, on your steak, on your toast?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our farmers here in Norway could actually have delivered the butter needed, but were prohibited from doing so through regulations with quotas.
So in this particular case, it was a failure of state socialism, not capitalism.

I agree that this is probably going to continue for a long time, so I better learn making my own butter. Currently I am eating some specially imported French butter.

One of the really bad things about this, is that the shops now sells large amount of margarine, which is really detrimental to health, since it is made of chemically modified plant fats, something we are not built to handle well.]]></description>
