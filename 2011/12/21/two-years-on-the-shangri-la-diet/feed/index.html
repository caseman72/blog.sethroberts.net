		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Quigley should read my thread as well. I did SLD throughout my weight loss (I think that took about two years) and have been weight stable via eating paleo for the past two years at around 170 (it fluctuates a bit but always goes back down).
I started at 285.  I&#039;m 6&#039;3.  

If Dr. Quigley were actually the sort of person who understood he at least could be wrong, I&#039;d be happy to talk to him. The difference between the old me and the new me is so striking that it shocks even me when I look in the mirror, and I find myself having to get comfortable with getting a lot more attention. Unfortunately, very few people appear to be able to take the transparently obvious evidence before their eyes.]]></description>
