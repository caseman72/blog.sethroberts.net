		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;This is why it’s so easy to not take evolutionary psychology seriously, because most often amateurs, but in this case, even people with psychology degrees, can and do simply make up stories and declare them genetic in basis.&lt;/em&gt;

I suggest you read my paper and see if I &quot;simply made up a story&quot;.  That paper will also help you judge how plausible my explanation is. If you have another plausible explanation of the ubiquity of harvest festivals and the like, I would like to hear it. 

&lt;em&gt;propose a mechanism by which individuals with the genes in question benefited over individuals without.&lt;/em&gt;

Groups with the genes innovated more than groups without the genes. The more innovative groups competed successfully against less innovative groups. I am sure you are aware of group-vs-group competition, even if critics of &quot;group selection&quot; have had trouble with the concept.]]></description>

You say &quot;The underlying genes evolved because they increased sales of high-end “useless” stuff. This helped skilled artisans&quot; but stop! The underlying genes became human-universal so that they could help a small cadre of people? No way! This is group-evolution theory at its subtlest! An evolutionary psychology argument that has even the slightest bit of probability needs to not just be a Just So Story, but to propose a mechanism by which individuals with the genes in question benefitted over individuals without. Harvest festivals require massive participation to be beneficial, and would seem to benefit everyone once they exist. There is no mechanism (proposed or immediately obvious) by which this could influence the relative frequency of an allele.

Wishful thinking is a common failure of amateur evolutionary psychologists, and it does a lot of damage to the credibility of the field as a whole. It takes very very careful analysis to discover a genetic basis to human behavior because of the massive adaptability of human behavior.]]></description>
