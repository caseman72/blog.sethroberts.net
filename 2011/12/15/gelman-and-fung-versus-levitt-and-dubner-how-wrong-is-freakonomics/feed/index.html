		<description><![CDATA[I read the American Scientist article and found it unseemly. Levitt and Dubner&#039;s shtick is to popularize ideas they find interesting. Neither the book nor the blog can be held to the same standards as peer reviewed literature. 

Gelman and Fung&#039;s criticism reminds me of the way so many PhD&#039;s used to nitpick Marilyn Vos Savant&#039;s column during its heyday. There were entire blogs devoted to pointing out her suposed errors. It was just a column in Parade, for God&#039;s sake, a publication used mostly to line bird cages. Intellectuals should have celebrated the fact that Middle America was being exposed to some mathematics instead of factoids about celebrities.

In today&#039;s intellectual climate, dissenting from the conventional wisdom on global warming is about the worst sin you can commit. I&#039;m sure you know this. The fact that Gelman and Fung saved the geoengineering stuff for last suggests to me that that was their main problem with Freakonomics. Bringing up the fact that scientists in the 1970s were worried about global cooling might just lead the reader to suspect that science doesn&#039;t know everything about climate. And we can&#039;t have that now, can we.]]></description>
