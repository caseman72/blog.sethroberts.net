		<description><![CDATA[I like her attitude. You can&#039;t take no s**t from the medical profession. If they can&#039;t &#039;see&#039; it (either physically or in tests), they will say it&#039;s &#039;in your mind&#039;. I had a very lengthy health battle with a difficult to diagnose health problem (funky kidney - a congenitally &#039;spiral&#039; ureter, the kidney would block and swell up to the size of a football (major bump in my front), but randomly empty). No doctor believed me that I had a randomly appearing lump. After three years I was progressively told I was stressed, depressed and perhaps even schizophrenic (like my father). Finally the kidney permanently blocked and I went in there to show off my &#039;alien baby&#039;. Immediate action/surgery. What&#039;s that Foucault said about the &#039;medical gaze&#039;? I lost 80% of kidney function on that side (thank goodness for having two kidneys!), but did I get an apology for being called insane? Nope.

Fructose - I was just blogging a bit about this because I&#039;m doing Lentzner&#039;s junkfree jan and was confused about it. I think the demonisation of it is an over-reaction to the acknowledged problems of HFCS and sucrose - high intakes could certainly exceed the liver&#039;s ability to deal with it as the usual metabolic control systems don&#039;t work with fructose. I haven&#039;t found any studies that use fruit, fruit juice, dried fruit or crystallised fructose though. As far as I know, all the research has been done using HFCS (which brings in issues of GM, amongst other things). Somebody put me right if that&#039;s not the case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a short comment about fructose:

Isn&#039;t it possible that the effect of fructose follows a J or inverted U curve? No fructose is irrelevant or bad, a little amount of fructose (say, from fruits) is beneficial (faster resynthesis of liver glycogen) and only large amounts (from excessive sugar/HFCS) are bad for your health?]]></description>

Lots of work and persistence,

And a high level of clarity as for the outcome measure.


I have no idea how such feats can become commonplace.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I think it is hard for non-scientists (and even some scientists) to understand that all scientific work has dozens of “flaws”. Pointing out the flaws in this or that is little help, unless those flaws haven’t been noticed.&quot;

Put this on a plaque.

Every time I go to a journal club (I&#039;m a scientist), the participants basically masturbate over their ability to recognize such &quot;flaws.&quot;

When this behavior is taken to excess, I usually take it as an indication that the person lacks abstract reasoning, or at least difficulty in understanding the concept of parsimony.

For example, a mathematical model might be reduced description of some phenomena, such that the equations are capturing the &quot;essence&quot; of the phenomena, and omitting the irrelevant details--i.e. if the details *were* included, the model would be nevertheless be &quot;isomorphic&quot; to the original, simpler description.

Many people get high on their ability to point out flaws without understanding the underlying framework.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[personally, I look at a self-experimentation anecdote as a source of ideas to test, and ideas about testing.  A persuasive, data-driven approach would lend an air of false authority, after all this is just a random internet person making health claims.  Well-designed self-experimentation is &quot;cheap, easy, and quick&quot; so I suggest going directly to replication if you find an experiment interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing I don&#039;t like, which you kind of mention, is that she doesn&#039;t seem to try actual foods.  Almost every isolated nutrient I&#039;ve tried has had a neutral or negative effect (Mg, vitamin K complex, alpha tocopherol, gamma tocopherol, D3).  I feel like one always runs into problems with comparative deficiencies when not using real foods.  

#9 is an excellent point that has caused me to stop reading several blogs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;The author of the “Adventures” blog seems unaware of — or at least unconcerned with — possible confounding factors like regression to the mean, placebo effects, and various cognitive biases. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

She&#039;s aware of the possibility of placebo effects -- see Point #3. I don&#039;t know what cognitive biases you are talking about. Regression to the mean is rarely a good explanation when Possible Solution #7 worked and Possible Solutions 1-6 did not work.

On the other hand, I agree about the numerical measurement, in the sense that if she made numerical measurements and made graphs and so on, you and I and others would probably find her conclusions more convincing. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Blessing today and all the days of 2012.

Please don&#039;t stop taking D3 up the B vitamins.  It has helped me through a winter without a serious depression.  By depression  I mean when it is too much trouble to even take a shower or brush my teeth.  When the normal activities that I do without notice become so burdensome that every move is like moving through tar.

The western medical system shines if you have broken your arm or have been in a gun fight.  

The eastern medical system shines for chronic conditions.  Nutrition and diet are the last bastion of the snake oil salesperson.

Nutrition changed my life, finding out I am allergic to diary changed my life, restricting gluten seems to be doing the same thing.  I gave that up for the holidays and guess what I am sick and......I realized I am sick more often than not during this period and I also noticed I allow myself unrestricted access to all my favorite cookies, tarts, and anything else with lots of sugar and lots of wheat.

Happy eating, continued nutritional adventures.
hugs, hm]]></description>
