		<description><![CDATA[A more interesting tale than the &quot;two workers&quot; is the story of the massive, silent campaign to push memes like this, to distract from the obscene concentration of societal wealth in the hands of the top .1% of the population -- largely financial titans and CEOs (with lapdog compensation committees.)

		<description><![CDATA[Just curious to hear what appealed about the &quot;Tale of Two Workers.&quot; It&#039;s a cute reversal, but the reversal changes the way you view the worker&quot;s&quot; -- the initial framing describes two situations that anyone would describe as typical, and the twist turns it into a situation that anyone would describe as exceptional. Which supports the point made at the end, that &quot;it&#039;s all in how you tell the story,&quot; but also vitiates the apparent point of the story, which is that more fortunate people aren&#039;t obliged to help less fortunate people because less fortunate people could do it themselves if they tried. (A proof of principle doesn&#039;t necessarily mean much if the phenomenon still doesn&#039;t happen very often. It may be true that anyone could write the next Harry Potter, but no amount of hard work will change the fact that most people won&#039;t.)

Of course, the implied conservative/libertarian moral may be more mine than the author&#039;s. And I do think it&#039;s interesting how Worker A&#039;s &quot;disadvantage&quot; and Worker B&#039;s &quot;advantage&quot; are not as incompatible as they seem when the framing implicitly opposes them. That might be the most interesting thing about the story.]]></description>
