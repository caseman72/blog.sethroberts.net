		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Glen. Those are very helpful comments and I will study them carefully. You ask: &quot;Have you ever been to a Chinese factory?&quot; 

No, I haven&#039;t. Here&#039;s what I can add to the discussion. 1. It is far from the truth that Chinese factory workers are a sea of misery within a wider context of happiness and joy. In fact, a survey of happiness in China found that construction workers (not factory workers) were among the happiest of any group in China. Construction workers are quite different from factor workers, of course, but the point is that simple Western ideas about who should be happy and who should be sad are wrong. I agree that Halpern&#039;s reflexive assumptions along these lines (e.g., long hours = bad working conditions) are just wrong. It is utterly true that factory jobs are better than rural village jobs. That&#039;s why people migrate to get them, leaving behind their family and sometimes their children. 2. Comparison of raw suicide rates is not a good idea. Compare them after they are adjusted for age and sex and income. 3. Foxconn workers have legitimate complaints. Illustrated by Mike Daisey&#039;s show. &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.google.com/109183248235415148427/buzz/WuvhUELfCT1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;For example.&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Daisey actually went there.&quot; 4. I don&#039;t believe that much is gained by Apple deciding that a Foxconn factory should be X, Y, and Z. That is the &quot;audit&quot; approach. I believe a lot can be gained by figuring out a way that Foxconn workers can have more power over their own working conditions. (Just as my work illustrates how one person can have more control of their health.) Isn&#039;t that one thing Apple supposedly sells: empowerment?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cultural products are software running on the operating system of human perceptions and emotions. I think it&#039;s more likely that instead of humans developing a tendency to observe days of celebration because it provides some opportunities for specialized trade, humans already had an ability to observe and respond to seasonal events, in common with other animals. Monkeys would show up at stands of trees at certain times of year, just when the fruit was ripe. There&#039;s also seasonal migration as part of the explanation of holidays.

Now we aren&#039;t looking for where the food is in nature at certain exact times of year. We&#039;re creating the experience of that in our artificial ways, indoors. Christmas meant to me when I was little a long trip to see our relatives, and mandarin oranges, the smell of Christmas trees, and some other kinds of treats, including nuts. That should be a clue what secular holidays are, besides an oxymoron.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s hard to get rich selling people what they need, as we need so little. But what we want never ends.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I disagree. I think what we want is an excellent guide to what we need. When we are cold, we want warmth. When we are thirsty, we want water. Societies need innovation...you can&#039;t keep doing the same thing forever. Innovation costs resources. To get those resources, the need for innovation must be turned into wants that cause innovation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard to get rich selling people what they need, as we need so little. But what we want never ends.

Yesterday, I stumbled into a &quot;Home Goods&quot; store. It was the first one I&#039;d ever seen, though apparently it&#039;s a major chain.  And it occurred to me: Everything in this store is useless.  No one needs ANYTHING in here!]]></description>
