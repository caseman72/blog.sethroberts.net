		<description><![CDATA[Filmmakers will tell you exactly how they perform their cinematic magic, down to the equipment used and the technical specs. This wide sharing of knowledge has resulted in the quality of special effects rising, and the costs dropping, exponentially. The movie-going public has developed higher standards of verisimilitude as a result, but it hasn&#039;t put them off watching movies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of points:

First of all, I recently read a book called, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Sleights-Mind-Neuroscience-Everyday-Deceptions/dp/0312611676/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals About Our Everyday Deceptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, by Stephen L. Macknik and Susana Martinez-Conde.  It wasn&#039;t as interesting as I thought it would be, but I think the very existence of the book is a sign that magic is expanding beyond its usual domains.

Second, I&#039;m all in favor of revealing the secrets behind magic tricks.  Hucksters like Uri Geller, Sylvia Browne, and Jonathan Edward (among many others) prey on naive people who don&#039;t realize how easy it is to be fooled by simple conjuring tricks.  Perhaps if some of these tricks become common knowledge, the public will become slightly less gullible. One can only hope, anyway.  (On the other hand, even people who ought to know better can be duped.  See this write-up of James &quot;the Amazing&quot; Randi&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Alpha&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Project Alpha&lt;/a&gt;.)]]></description>
