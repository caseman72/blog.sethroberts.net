Seattle -- where she lived before Ireland -- is also very cloudy. On the other hand it is possible she spent more time outdoors in Seattle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;What I don’t see after a quick perusal, where did she move to Ireland _from_? What about _that_ dairy? What’s the difference?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She moved to Ireland from Seattle. My guess is that Irish dairy is less processed (e.g., less heated) than Seattle dairy. Milk contains dozens of different molecules. Seattle processing destroyed something that the Irish processing left intact. Another possibility is that Irish cows are better nourished and certain allergens were at higher concentrations in Irish dairy than in Seattle dairy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We give Kerrygold to our autism kids because we&#039;ve found it contriutes to peace around the house.

Because we get it at Costco and it&#039;s priced well, I wonder how it&#039;s being processed, etc. There&#039;s got to be something wrong with it, right? I&#039;d like it if there was a third pary who could verify what exactly grass-fed means to Kerrygold and how the product is handled before it makes it to the store shelf.

However, the results are pretty good. So, yay Kerrygold.

To your point about grass-fed not neccessairly meaning good, what is grass? As consumers we want to imagine cows in a patoral scene grazing lazily in a field of deep green beside a crystal stream of mountain snow melt. I imagine the commercial or regulatory definition (if there even is one) of grass-fed is much broader.

It could be that Kerrygold is racing to the bottom by being cheap. Or it could be they&#039;re the second coming of Warren Edward Deming in the dairy industry, an application of scientific method to the process of creating butter with a long term focus on the integrity of the product and the business. Who knows?

In the end, I&#039;m happy with the results in our family and we eat a lot of it.

What I don&#039;t see after a quick perusal, where did she move to Ireland _from_? What about _that_ dairy? What&#039;s the difference?

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I would eat Irish dairy which is grass-fed and natural as they come before chinese dairy that has god knows what contaminants in it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree. There has just been &lt;strong&gt;another&lt;/strong&gt; scandal about contaminated milk in China. In Beijing, I eat American butter (Land O&#039;Lakes). The cream I use is from Nestle but thanks to your comment I see it is made in China -- I won&#039;t buy it again. No wonder it was much cheaper than other cream. I cannot avoid buying Chinese milk but I buy the most expensive brand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;But at this point, when I do have cream or milk with coffee or something dairy like a dessert I feel like indulging in, it’s often just a matter of hours before I can feel my face heating up somewhere and I know I’ll have a spot the following day. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This does not fit the grass-fed/non-grass-fed emphasis we usually hear when discussing the quality of dairy products (grass-fed = good, non-grass-fed = bad). Grass-fed is supposedly better because grass has more omega-3 than the alternative to grass (e.g., corn). The presence/absence of omega-3 in cream or dessert is unlikely to make such a big difference so quickly. Nor is it clear how omega-3 can cause skin problems. It sounds like something else about Irish dairy is causing the problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Glen, good points! What I may not have done a great job explaining in my blog post that I covered in great detail in my talk is that each of those things I cut out for a month. So no caffeine for a month - no result? Okay, caffeine back in. When I cut dairy out it was dairy only. Everything else in my diet was the same. As you mention, it would be impossible to attribute it to one thing otherwise! 

Now I have introduced goats milk back in to my diet and occasionally cows milk cheeses. But at this point, when I do have cream or milk with coffee or something dairy like a dessert I feel like indulging in, it&#039;s often just a matter of hours before I can feel my face heating up somewhere and I know I&#039;ll have a spot the following day. But the difference is that now I can weigh the cost and I know what I&#039;m getting in to.

Hope that clarifies a little, sorry for any confusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth I live in Ireland and used to have acne, cutting out dairy didn&#039;t do a thing, increasing it helped though. What was the ultimate cure for me was increasing intake of vitamin E. Anytime people cut out a food they replace it with something else. For all we know that&#039;s what made the difference.

		<description><![CDATA[Another quibble: she&#039;d need to &lt;i&gt;resume dairy for a bit&lt;/i&gt; (and see the acne return) to conclude it was the dairy and not something more like regression to the mean. Her treatment course as described sounds a lot like what convinced doctors to over-trust depression meds. To wit:

&lt;i&gt;I have condition X, so I try treatment A. That doesn&#039;t help so I try treatment B. Then C. Then D. At the end of a year, condition X resolves and I credit the last thing I tried right before the improvement - which was treatment H.&lt;/i&gt;

If you try one thing and get better right away, that&#039;s evidence that the thing you tried worked. But if you try 10 things over the course of a year it&#039;s a foregone conclusion that you were trying &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; when you get better, but the evidence is weak that the getting better had to do with the specific last thing you tried.

(The things she mentions trying are the removal of: chicken, soy, sugar, glu­ten, carbs, starches, caf­feine, meat, fish, dairy). Ten things. Heck, for all we know it could be one of the earlier ones (with some delay in effectiveness). Or none of them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; The evidence so far (she didn’t have skin problems until she moved to Ireland) suggests that at least for her American dairy (i.e., dairy where she lived in America) is better than Irish dairy. I have heard Irish dairy praised. They sell Irish butter at Beijing stores near me. I won’t be buying it.

Or it could be an equilibrium effect - she tolerated whatever it was in dairy until a shock to her system weakened her. Could retrospect for similar massive shocks (going to college? a parent dying?) and try to recall if there were any acne outbreaks.

You&#039;ve probably seen https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/tara-parker-pope-fat-trap.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all which discusses an equilibrium shift for obesity.

(I think something similar happened to my sister which lead to her gluten allergy becoming a huge problem and then discovered.)
