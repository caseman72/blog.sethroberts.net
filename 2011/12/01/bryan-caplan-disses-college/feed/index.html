		<description><![CDATA[I want to do a little thought experiment with what Tracy W said, &quot;So college should be providing something that can&#039;t be gotten far more cheaply in other ways.&quot;  College is but a small part of the world of knowledge, but should college offerings only be what people can &quot;make a living at&quot; there would not be much left to college at all.  What, then, might people be missing?  Quite a lot that makes the world go round.

The problem for college is not that it is impractical.  The problem for higher education is that it has not been able to integrate the actual use of knowledge in its many forms at local levels.  When people can not actually validate their worth amongst one another through knowledge, they eventually react by insisting that knowledge is not even important.  This is the real issue that formal education needs to address.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;for most professors, the thing they can do that is unusual and not easily replicable by someone without their training, is to evaluate how close what the students are doing is to what said professor would have done &lt;/em&gt;

True. But in most cases college isn&#039;t optional. For a large fraction of good jobs, you must go to college. Professors have a captive audience. Their students did not choose to be there. This is why it is unreasonable for professors to simply do whatever they want to do. That would be abuse of power.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read your examples here, and I think they&#039;re very interesting, but I wonder how much of what you do here you can do because you&#039;re a professor of psychology, and thus these things shouldn&#039;t be expected of every professor. Take for example evaluating whether someone has displayed courage - your student giving a talk to a high-school class - can a professor of mathematics bring anything to this evaluation more than a lay person? When I was 13, we had to give speeches at school and one of my friends was so scared she was crying while doing it, but she didn&#039;t run away, and since then I have considered her one of the bravest people I know. I haven&#039;t learnt anything from university that has led me to change my mind. You might have a special insight into the level of courage displayed from your psychology training, but what can a maths professor be expected to add? 

Or take your students&#039; project, reading your linked article, it sounds like the students didn&#039;t do anything they couldn&#039;t have done without going to university, I know people who volunteer for a depression hotline despite doing a full-time paid job in a very different field. What you appear to have provided was a &quot;kick-up-the-bum&quot; to try something new. A good school teacher, or scouts leader, can do the same. As a psychology professor, you might be more competent at working out how to do this, and how to evaluate the results, than most people, but I can&#039;t see how a political science professor would have similar skills. 

And the other thing is that college is very expensive, a lot more expensive than high school, or joining toastmasters to practice public speaking, or taking a cooking course to improve the quality of your food, or trying your hand at writing funny stories and posting them online for feedback. Indeed, some ways you can even get paid for doing some of these things, for example if you want to demonstrate courage, joining the army and specialising in mine clearing would be one way. So college should be providing something that can&#039;t be gotten far more cheaply in other ways.  

Not being an expert, but I&#039;d say that for most professors, the thing they can do that is unusual and not easily replicable by someone without their training, is to evaluate how close what the students are doing is to what said professor would have done (and perhaps provide the structure of learning, the only way I&#039;ve been able to defeat my procrastinating tendencies when it comes to learning maths is by signing up for a formal class). As a psychologist you are, I think, unusually qualified to do different things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Most psychologists don’t in fact glorify IQ, because they know that IQ is a construct that bears little relationship to ability. Nobody has even been able to pin down what intelligence actually IS. Is the rest of your article any better researched?&lt;/em&gt;

&quot;Researched&quot;? Huh? I lived it, am still living it. I am a psychology professor. I haven&#039;t encountered any researcher who worries that &quot;nobody has even been able to pin down what intelligence actually IS&quot;.  As to whether or not IQ has been glorified, can you tell me a book about some other mental ability that had the impact of The Bell Curve? Among psychologists, Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg are important exceptions to the general rule of focusing on IQ as the most important way that people differ. .IQ tests predict who will do well at school. We have a society that rewards people who do well at school. Then those very same rewarded/powerful people turn around and say:&lt;em&gt;Doing well at school (= IQ) is the most important thing!&lt;/em&gt; When the circularity is pointed out, they get confused. They fail to understand the &lt;strong&gt;whatever is, is right&lt;/strong&gt; feature of their argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After thumbing through Critical Path (yet again) it&#039;s hard to say exactly which quote impressed me most.  His belief in the individual, however, really stayed with me.  He believed that - if we would tell the truth - we had a great chance at not just survival but much more.  He had the kind of hope for knowledge that I also hold, that it can somehow survive in the Universe for the long haul.   Buckminster Fuller would stress to people that they should never give up on their own unique way of looking at the world, that our uniqueness was the very element that could make the difference.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;After maybe half a dozen responses by the GSI, I discovered a clear (albeit never explicitly stated) theme: to get an ‘A’, you needed to regurgitate EXACTLY what the professor had said in lecture.  This completely shocked me (hey, I was only 17). This was a Sociology class taught by an (allegedly) “cutting edge” professor who said lots of radical things (well, they were radical to me).&lt;/i&gt;

A lot of what we call education is substituting one religion (sometimes even with a catecism!) for another.  Jim Purdy, take note.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lying fingerprints:

All methods I have seen for analyzing fingerprints are inaccurate heuristics which throw away information and do not make proper estimates of uncertainty or the amount of information present in the prints.

DNA analysis is a counterexample to this, because there there are several very good deep statistical methods which do a very good job, but forensic people still mess it up in courts from time to time.

Detectives McKie and fingerprint expert Bayle have been victims of the typical tribal nonsense, communism style, where status and hierarchy counts more than evidence and truth.

Looking at the results from the 2006 Fingerprint Verification Competition, I see that the best fingerprint programs typically extract 5-8 bits of information from each print, with some outliers of 9-12 bits on easy tests. This is much less information than is actually present in most fingerprints. From my experience, what happens here, is that the programs are fragile. They do better when the prints are easy to recognize, but typically deteriorate a lot when there are even slight modifications to the prints, such as being partial, deformed, dirty, scarred, worn, etc., which they typically are in real life.

As a comparison, DNA tests today can read billions bits of information from a cell, though those methods are not used by forensics.

My fingerprint analyzer, which was made about 10 years ago, read about 7 bits per print, and was fairly robust. This was fairly good at the time, unless one take into account that this was done on encrypted fingerprints, without having keys for decryption. Then it was quite fantastic, far beyond everything similar in the industry.

To identify a person uniquely, 32.5 random bits are necessary, for 6 billion people. To identify all persons uniquely, twice this is necessary, 65 bits.

In the article, they claim 99.97 % accuracy while searching the forensic database of fingerprints, which corresponds to about 12 bits of information, similar to the best entries int the FVC on easy prints. 

As for my education as a physicist: I could not have made my fingerprint analyzer without a lot of that math and physics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s difficult to teach those things that are most important to a successful career.  I spent a huge amount of money to get an MBA degree, but I learned almost nothing that was useful to me.

Off the top of my head, these are the skills that I think are most important to succeed in the business world (note that I don&#039;t claim to be good at any of them):

1) Getting along well with others, including navigating office politics

2) Maintaining a sense of optimism and enthusiasm even in the face of set-backs

3) Appearing sharp and &quot;on the ball&quot; at meetings

4) Being organized, dependable, meeting deadlines, and keeping your promises.

There are probably others, but those are the ones that come to mind.  None of these things were taught in business school (well, possibly indirectly -- and not very well).  The stuff that we &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; learn, like net present value calculations and the Black-Scholes pricing model, never came up again for me.  And if they did, I probably could have learned them on the job.]]></description>

<p>3) Appearing sharp and &#8220;on the ball&#8221; at meetings</p>
<p>4) Being organized, dependable, meeting deadlines, and keeping your promises.</p>
<p>There are probably others, but those are the ones that come to mind.  None of these things were taught in business school (well, possibly indirectly &#8212; and not very well).  The stuff that we <i>did</i> learn, like net present value calculations and the Black-Scholes pricing model, never came up again for me.  And if they did, I probably could have learned them on the job.</p>

&gt; You mean: valuable to students?

School work may be largely (although not entirely) meaningless. But getting a degree demonstrates that you can follow instructions and work hard and achieve deadlines. It&#039;s not everything - but knowing this much about someone is more useful (to an employer) than not knowing anything.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Not since Buckminster Fuller was alive do I remember reading about human worth in this way.&lt;/em&gt;

Becky, yeah, there is some similarity. I found this quote from Fuller: “Everyone is born a genius, but the process of living de-geniuses them.” What were you thinking of?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: the comment about no advantage to lower IQ. That&#039;s true, but in many fields there are diminishing returns above about 120. Think about how important (and highly compensated) sales jobs are. Do you think the average sales guy would benefit from a 150 IQ?

Michael Milken made all his money not because he was brilliant, but because he was good at sales. Jack Welch and Ted Turner spoke of how much he seemed to care about their personal lives instead of just trying to push a transaction.

Further, something like 20% of successful entrepreneurs are dyslexic (including such names as Charles Schwab). Shouldn&#039;t such relatively rare learning disability predict failure?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;What is an example of a problem that has not been solved very well because the group of people working on that problem put too much emphasis on the IQ of the problem solvers and not enough emphasis on the diversity of the problem solvers?&lt;/em&gt;

Here are two examples:

1. The 2008 financial crisis. The people in charge had/have high IQs. I believe a more diverse group of people would have found a better solution. (They would have had less of a status-quo bias, for one thing.) 

2. Stomach ulcers. People with high IQs think that those two Australian Nobel Prize winners, Marshall and Warren, found the cause of stoma ulcers (a certain species of bacteria). I think a more diverse group of problem solvers would find a better solution. (Almost everyone who has the supposedly causative bacterium doesn&#039;t get ulcers.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; The glorification of IQ has had a solipsistic aspect and has ignored what should be obvious, that diversity of talents and skills promotes innovation. Without a diverse talent pool, any society will do a poor job of solving the problems that inevitably arise.
