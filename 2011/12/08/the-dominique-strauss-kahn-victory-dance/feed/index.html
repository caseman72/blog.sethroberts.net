		<description><![CDATA[To sum up, many (most ?) french people now firmly believe in a political plot. I don&#039;t believe at all DSK is a rapist, but what is sure is, DSK&#039;s appetite for prostitutes (or should I say sexual disorder) would have, sooner or later, undermined him politically. Yet multiple sexual scandals didn&#039;t kill Berlusconi, the economical near collapse of Italy did. 

Still, DSK knew that his sexual misconducts would be the catalyst of his own demise. He also knew that Sarkozy knew everything about them, and that he would try to kill him politically with this weapon. So for me, everything was ready for a trap. 

I didn&#039;t mention that the behaviour of Ray Kelly, the chief of NY police, looks to me extremely suspect in this affair. He is very well known to Sarkozy (who awarded him the Legion d&#039;Honneur medal), and I believe he is at the source of numerous police leaks with blatant lies, like the fact that DSK fled the hotel in a hurry (which is proven false by the video). He also fired the police officer in charge of sexual affairs, who quickly discovered that Diallo was lying (as was accounted by the NY Times). I suspect him to have done everything he could to slow down the investigations.

There are many unanswered questions:
- what was the role of N. Diallo in such a plot ? What did she do in room 2820 ?
- who was the occupier of room 2820 (the Accor group refuses to give his name) ?
- where is the &quot;FMI telephone&quot; ?
- what was the content of the conversations between the Sofitel management and Paris ?

It is clear that in Paris, there will be NO serious investigation, as the power of the judges are dependent on the ministry of Justice, which is indirectly under the orders of Sarkozy. So the hopes for any full understanding entirely resides in America.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I should have read the whole post, I see that we share the same doubts.

I want to add a few things that you guys may not know from your side of the Atlantic.

1) The first person who twitted about DSK arrest is a guy who belongs to UMP youths, (UMP is Nicolas Sarkozy&#039;s party). He twitted about something &quot;exceptional&quot; happening at the Sofitel about 15 minutes after the arrest. That&#039;s WAY earlier than any journalist. That was one of the first facts that led to the Sarkozy conspiracy hypothesis.

2) It seems to me that the Sofitel security called Paris BEFORE calling the NY police. They took one hour before calling the police.

3) It is now clear (as written by daily newspaper LibÃ©ration on 12/09/2011) that the french ministry of foreign affairs (quai d&#039;Orsay) called the prosecutor Cyrus Vance Jr on may 15th, the day after DSK&#039;s arrest, to weigh in to maintain him in prison. DSK&#039;s name was cited in an investigation in an affair of prostitution. The quai d&#039;Orsay illegally communicated to Vance elements of this investigation that are normally protected by the secrecy of judicial instruction (in France, Justice is not independant from the executive, leading to such problems...). DSK was about to be released on parole against $250,000, but after the call, the prosecutor changed his mind and DSK was incarcerated that very evening at Riker&#039;s Island. The initiative came from Paris and was completely stranger to any judicial procedure.

4) The director of security of the hotel is an ancient member of the DGSE/DCRI (the french secret services) who worked under the current chief of DGSE/DCRI.

DSK was by far the most dangerous opponent of Sarkozy for the french presidential elections of 2012, beating him by more than 25 points in all polls.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; The victory dance, she wrote, âdoesnât seem outlandish, given the sorts of things men do in New York, particularly when talking about sport.â 

Really ? There was NO sporting event of note that day. And cheering like that ONE MINUTE after having called the police, are you kidding me ?
Also, how comes the two guys are both struck with amnesia about this event ? How comes they can&#039;t remember having cheered about it ?
The ACCOR group states they were cheering about a won bet on a (non existent) sport event. Given the way they cheered, obviously they won a LOT of money. How comes they can&#039;t remember it ??

That doesn&#039;t make any sense. They are ALL lying, this is obvious to any person who looks at this with a fair eye.]]></description>

I assume you&#039;re a man. When was the last time you picked up another man and swung him around?]]></description>
