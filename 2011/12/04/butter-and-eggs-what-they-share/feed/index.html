		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the milk and egg theory but I think it also comes down to the phenotype, life stage and life style of the person. I see these foods as anabolic overall, and if your system still contains anabolic capacity than it could be good for you, however if you do not have this anabolic capacity left than it can be deteramental. Staying on the edge of and measuring your Homeostasis is hard but swinging up and down between anabolism and catabolism on average would put you on that edge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am thinking about what might cause the effects you see with high butter consumption.  As your diet was low fat, do you think you are experiencing the benefits of fat-soluble vitamins? (D, K and A specifically are quite high in butter, particularly Vit A, retinol form). If you analyse your diet as it was, perhaps you were low in these vitamins? The question of Vitamin D is interesting because eggs also contain it, but apart from fish, there are hardly any other dietary sources (milk, eggs, fish and some mushrooms, I think that&#039;s it for vitamin D). Do you think you might have been in a state of vitamin D deficiency perhaps and have rectified it with the butter and egg consumption?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dang, it accepted them even with the spaces.

Anyway, before the section you want to italicize, enter a shift-comma, then a lowercase i, then a shift-period.

To stop italicizing, enter a shift-comma, then a forward-slash (unshifted questionmark), then a lowercase i, then a shift-period.

(You can bold by replacing the lowercase i with a lowercase b.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aaron, it&#039;s a pretty standard markup.  Hopefully the symbols will come through if I put in additional spaces:

[Obviously, remove the extra spaces before and after the angle-brackets (shift-comma and shift-period) when you use them]:

Start italics:  &lt;i&gt;
End italics: &lt;/i&gt;

Start bolding: &lt;b&gt;
End bolding: &lt;/b&gt;]]></description>

&quot;only in&quot; is too strong. Lab experiments -- that is, not in an EEA -- show that rats can choose a healthy diet, as I described in my original Mr. T post.
