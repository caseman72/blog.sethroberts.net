		<description><![CDATA[I am honored that Seth has referenced my posts on his blog, but I wanted to make one minor correction: I&#039;m a girl.  (I chose the user name because of Carl Jung&#039;s use of it, but I can see how it could be confusing, because men have an anima, but it represents feminine qualities.)  My gender is not salient, but ADHD manifests differently in women, and both it and Non-24 are far more prevalent in males, so I think it worth noting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This worked for me. I can&#039;t take vitamin D pills, but limiting nighttime blue light exposure gets me to sleep faster, and eating quickly after waking and stopping eating 12 hours before I want to wake up allowed me to shift my Circadian to normal hours. Awesome!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One more thing that might not be incurable-- I can make tinnitus stop for months by relaxing the big neck muscle on the same side as the ear. I generally just move my attention down that muscle a number of times, but massage or visualization might be worth exploring, too.

Writing this makes me realize that I should explore moving my attention along other muscles I want to relax.

Note-- I&#039;ve never had major exposure to loud sounds, the tinnitus seems to be related to anxiety, perhaps especially anxiety about money.

Another note to make all this more plausible-- when I move my head, I&#039;ve occasionally felt the way neck muscles connect to my ear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who is bipolar, I look forward to trying these suggestions.  I have not had depression since using Seth&#039;s suggestions on morning faces.  The only problem has been some mania and anxiety.  I have these same problems with sleep.  Going to bed very late and sleeping very late.  Started back on ambien recently.

Cutting out sugar has really seemed to help my anxiety of late.  I realized I had really increased my sugar intake when my anxiety began.  Of course starting back exercising has helped too. 
 Cold showers helped my depression last year at this time. 

I was off medication for the first time in 9 years this summer, but the aforementioned problems from life stresses led me to get back on Cymbalta and Lamictal along with use of xanax when needed.  The xanax seems to be the only thing that helps.  Hope to eventually be able to get healthy on natural remedies only.  Slowly and carefully.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Seth, 

Thanks for this post and your writing on this site.

Have you tried using the Vitamin D in the morning and the leg stands together for better sleep?

 After reading for a while I started taking Vitamin D in the morning. I have been using the sleep cycle app on my I phone.  Yesterday I walked about 9.5 miles, and I fell asleep quickly and woke up rested, and according to my app it seemed I sleep more deeply as well. Have you heard of anyone mixing vitamin D  and walking?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The book &quot;The Brain That Changes Itself&quot; had a fascinating bit about attention deficit - researchers found that having kids memorize long poems and practice a new alphabet (handwriting , not computers) was more effective than drugs for treating AD - the author remarked that a generation ago, it was common for kids to learn poetry (most of our grandparents can still recite poems they had to memorize for school) and of course, there was great emphasis on penmanship.

These things were jettisoned in the sixties, when educator figured the typewriter and recording devices rendered these skills unnecessary.]]></description>
