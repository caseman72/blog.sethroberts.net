		<description><![CDATA[Finkelstein&#039;s career has been ruined ever since he started taking on the powerful Israeli lobby.  Several universities have been pressured out of hiring him.  Meanwhile a liar and fraud like Dershowitz has a comfortable well paid seat at Harvard where he advocates legalized torture. 

With the recent death of Christopher Hitchens Steve Sailer wrote that no one has paid a price for being wrong on the iraq war, - and no one who was right (hat it would be a disaster) was rewarded or even acknowledged. 

Likewise, to date, not one top figure in the mortgage meltdown/crisis has gone to jail, despite obvious criminal activity. 

This is what a corrupt society looks like.]]></description>
