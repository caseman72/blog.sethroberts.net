		<description><![CDATA[Steph, I think it might be a psychological effect whereby you&#039;re more likely to explore some interesting, off-the-wall idea if you&#039;ve discovered it through your own research vs. having someone (particularly are relative) recommend it to you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jenny, I&#039;m with you.  I loved the SL book, and have been using the oil (not consistently - need to get back on track), and I love how it helps suppress appetite, and I did a post about the SL diet to spread the word, and told some family members who confided that they want to lose weight, and gave the book away to one of them...

And there have been no takers, just polite, &quot;Oh!  Interesting.  Well, I just need to make better food choices and get moving...&quot;  Which is great, but not at all incompatible with SL.

 I don&#039;t know why anyone would NOT try something that is 1. safe, 2. painless, 3. healthy, and 4. potentially very effective for weight loss.  I&#039;m stumped.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brian is right on the money.

In addition trying to share something even with relatives is tough. Everyone has their own way of thinking, mine just happens to have become so calculative that I take in ALL DATA and FACTORS and form a very comprehensive world view that incorporates all perspectives and facts.

Other people only siphon what is of interest to them and refuse to step outside of their comfort zone, and effectively restrict themselves to strict parameters that do not vary.

Sharing may be caring but not many people are receptive to care these days :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Makes me chuckle. I think the comment says more about the commenter than about the commenter&#039;s diet. When I find something that works in some way, I want to scream it from the rooftops so that all my friends and family could reap the benefits, (but I put a lid on it for the most part not to be a nag, unless they ask). Why wouldn&#039;t I want people I love to lose weight and feel better?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brian, last night I told a female friend of mine about the competitive-women comment. She thought it was very funny and said she wouldn&#039;t  be like that -- she would tell her friends.

		<description><![CDATA[I think the reasons why the diet is not more popular is because it flies in the face of conventional thinking, and it isn&#039;t continuously promoted.

The unconventional nature would appeal to a certain small subset of the population that likes to try offbeat things or believes that solutions are to be found in unusual places.  This will gain traction with certain people but in order for the idea to attain a broader appeal, it has to be packaged in a way that it can be easily consumed (the idea, not the diet).

The Atkins diet was unconventional, but was also heavily promoted, not just with a single book but an orchestrated marketing campaign.  For example Wikipedia says that the Atkins Center had 87 employees in the mid-90&#039;s.

People with a scientific / engineering bent often think that a great idea will market itself.  This is the downfall of many a nascent software company for example.  Unfortunately, this isn&#039;t true.  An idea needs to be effectively and continuously promoted in order to take hold.]]></description>
