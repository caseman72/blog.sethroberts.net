		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, I&#039;ve been a huge fan and reader for a while after seeing your work on the Quantified Self then 4HB. One angle to look at the productivity increase is your recognition and reinforcement of your intentionality through visual feedback.

You mention the difference before and after seeing feedback when a previous reader mentioned the Hawthorne effect, and I kind of dig the experimental set-up. It isn&#039;t the information that changed your work efficiency. but a subconscious change in your behavior that indicates an increase in self-efficacy. In this post you name a gentle pressure and realistic goals from already establishing a baseline for comparison. Mindfulness practictioners would call this a non-judgmental attitude combined with an acceptance of your previous efficiency. By visually feeding this back, you could explain the benefit to your efficiency through behavior change that arose from the awareness aspect.

I generally liked your definition of work (actual work + related tasks), though email is such a tricky THING to categorize. It definitely is difficult to thread the needle between doing work and being busy with &quot;work&quot;. :)]]></description>
