The 2005-2009 weight drop was caused by me being on ADHD medication.
The early 09/11 weight spikes were caused by massive amounts of dairy intake. 
In 2005 I changed my weight scale body fat analyzer measurement from &quot;athlete&quot; to &quot;regular&quot; which is why the bf% shot up. Otherwise my bf% is highly correlated with my total weight.

I&#039;ve been eating paleo/primalesq/lc since around September 2009.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve a friend who went to no flour, no sugar, lost 190 lbs in about twelve months and has kept it off for four years, tomorrow (he was a day short this morning when we talked).

But his Taubes style diet is rigorous.  He is part of a group using it and they&#039;ve noted that any deviation and the weight starts to come back.

Interesting, my weight has gone up and down (my rest point is 189 +/1 10 lbs, though it went up to 205 over Christmas, is down to 197 this morning).

I&#039;ve been paying attention to various inputs that seem to make a difference and find the whole very interesting.  If I switch to a noseclipped meal in addition to my normal regimen, I drop weight.  If I increase ditto food I can push weight up.

I&#039;m not sure how far I can push weight up with ditto food, I bailed out at 205.  I lack the willingness to embrace weight gain for scientific study, at least past a certain point where my comfort zone ends  ;)]]></description>
