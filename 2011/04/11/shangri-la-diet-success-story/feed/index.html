		<description><![CDATA[I am so happy for you Kainin.  I&#039;ve been on SLD for 1 week and lost 8 lbs.  I started at 350 and weighed in today at 342.  I only half did it and got great results.  I do 3 tbs. ELOO in the morning before work and get in SW during the day.  I still have some hungry periods and that&#039;s when I start to drink the SW.   I don&#039;t quite have the 2 hr window together yet but I&#039;m working on it.  This is a diet (I mean a way of living) that I can use the rest of my life.]]></description>
