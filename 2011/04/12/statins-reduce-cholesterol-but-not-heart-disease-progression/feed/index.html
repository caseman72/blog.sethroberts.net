		<description><![CDATA[Bryan, I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t understand your friend&#039;s comments. Why was she &quot;appalled&quot;? I would have thought someone in health care would be &lt;strong&gt;happy&lt;/strong&gt; that I managed to reduce my heart disease risk. 

By &quot;the machines measuring your cholesterol&quot; I assume you mean the machine measuring my heart disease progression.  My two heart disease progression measurements were done on the same machine. I strongly doubt your friend knows details of the machine&#039;s calibration, such as who calibrated it (&quot;two different techs&quot;), when it was calibrated (&quot;a year apart&quot;), and the accuracy of the calibration. 

Neither of my measurements is unusual, that is, neither is an &quot;outlier&quot;. It is when they are compared that the results are unusual.]]></description>

Your last comment does not accurately describe my position (I think statins are fast-acting *on LDL* and I never said or implied otherwise) nor do I think it accurately describe the study authors&#039; (entirely linear) calculations but I certainly agree that I&#039;ve learned something from the discussion and that we&#039;ve beaten this topic to death.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You bring up a good point. I am indeed assuming that the statin changed LDL quickly -- in a week, say. If the statin changed LDL more slowly -- say, took 1 year to have its full effect -- then your comments make sense. I think the statins change LDL quickly -- so a person who starts taking a statin January 1 will have much lower LDL (if the statin dose is large enough) for almost the whole year. But I did not make that assumption clear. I think it is correct, however.

Now I understand your Regression 2, thanks. It makes an assumption of linearity that the power analysis done by the authors does not. (For example, it assumes that a change from 80 to 40 will produce the same effect as a change from 60 to 20.) Their power analysis however assumes fast-acting effects of statins, as I said. I don&#039;t agree with you that your assumption (linearity) is plainly more plausible than theirs (fast-acting effects), but at least I now understand what you are saying.

I prefer dosage-variation experiments to placebo-vs.-treatment experiments because they are far less confounded.

I&#039;m afraid that&#039;s the last comment I am going to make about this. Thank you, Ragout, for your comments, which have helped me understand this better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;[Regression 1] would give you the difference to expect between groups in your experiment. &lt;/i&gt;

Regression 1 gives you the difference to expect between people with initially low LDL and initially higher LDL, but these aren&#039;t analogous to the treatment and control groups in the experiment.  In fact, because the experiment is a randomized trial, both groups will have the _same_ initial level of LDL, on average.  So regression 1, used by the authors of the paper you cited, tells you nothing relevant to the power analysis.

More properly, the treatment group consists of people whose LDL will go down more during the course of the experiment compared to the control group.  So you make regression 2 by looking at an earlier experiment.  For each person in the earlier experiment, you know (a) how much their plaque changed over the course of the experiment and (b) how much their cholesterol changed.  You plot a against b.  What&#039;s so hard about that?  (aside: you might want to use only the treatment group in your plot).  So Regression 2 would have been the relevant calculation to perform for the power analysis.


&lt;i&gt;I say the benefit is surprisingly small, given how much money is spent on them.&lt;/i&gt;

Then you should look at experiments that examine the benefits of statins (vs. placebo), not whether more statins are better than less statins!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How can I say statins have no benefit? I don&#039;t. I say the benefit is surprisingly small, given how much money is spent on them.

Re the power analysis. Your two regressions are:

(1) d Plaque = a + b LDL and
(2) d Plaque = a + b d LDL,
where d is the 1-year change.

With regression 1 you would look at the graph and compute a difference: d Plaque at one level of LDL minus d Plaque at another level of LDL. That would give you the difference to expect between groups in your experiment. The scatterplot behind the second regression is mysterious (how could it be made? what does it mean?) and could not tell you what difference in d Plaque to expect between groups. One way to make a plot with d LDL on the x axis would be to compute differences between groups. But then the y axis would be d d Plaque, not d Plaque.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;A graph that shows plaque change per year as a function of LDL concentration certainly allows one to estimate how much plaque change per year will go down (or up) if LDL concentration is altered. &lt;/i&gt;

It occurs to me that a simpler answer is: no it doesn&#039;t.  A graph that shows the level of plaque as a function of the level of LDL might arguably allow one to estimate the change in plaque as function of the change in LDL.  However, the graph you mention (changes vs. levels) simply doesn&#039;t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;So I am afraid I don’t follow your criticism of the power analysis.&lt;/i&gt;  

It&#039;s wise of you to focus on this distinctly secondary question.  I&#039;ll answer it, but first, let me ask you about the main question: how you can possibly rely on this study to  back up your original claim about statins? 

To recap: numerous studies of statins against placebo have shown that statins reduce plaque build-up and reduce the incidence of hear attacks and stroke.  Now scientists can no longer ethically or legally conduct such studies, since it would be immoral to withhold drugs the medical community has determined are beneficial, so scientists have moved on to secondary questions.  In the study you cite, the secondary question is whether high-dose statins have additional benefits in patients already responding well to low-dose statins.  Even if the answer to this secondary question is no, how can you possibly conclude that statins have no benefit?

On the question of what precisely is wrong with the power analysis of the particular study you cite: surely you don&#039;t deny that using change in LDL would be better for the analysis than the level of LDL, since changing LDL is exactly what the authors plan to do in their experiment.  

More generally, I see no special reason to think that these two regressions will have the same coefficient b:

(1) d Plaque = a + b LDL and 
(2) d Plaque = a + b d LDL, 
where d is the 1-year change.

In fact, there&#039;s every reason to think that the b coefficients will be different.  I think that LDL in regression 1 is a proxy for the previous lifetime path of LDL, which is what really mattters.  By contrast, in regression 2, past values of LDL have been differenced out.   In short, what you&#039;re really missing is that atherosclerosis (plaque buildup) is a cumulative process that occurs over many years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I take statins, various blood pressure medications, and now a drug for diabetes, plus baby aspirin, plus an antidepressant. When I asked my doctor, who I respect, whether we really know that these are helping prolong my life, he was honest. He said we don&#039;t know, but that something is helping at-risk people like myself to live longer with fewer heart attacks and strokes; it could be reducing stress or better aerobic exercise, or people changing their diets, more than the medications. There is simply no way to disentangle what is causing the positive effects, but no one is denying that people at risk who take these drugs are living longer, with less morbidity... Correlational data is dubious and you can&#039;t do studies where you deprive people of exercise and rest and take it from there. And longitudinal follow-up studies have serious problems as well...

So I take them... My intuition is that getting plenty of rest and plenty of exercise are probably the 2 most important factors, but it&#039;s only an intuition, probably biased by the fact that I get plenty of both...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;The amount of progression they measured was what you’d expect from people taking no statins. &lt;/i&gt;

I think you&#039;re wrong to suggest that a 25% progression per year is some kind of universal law.  For example, in the study the researchers cited in their power analysis (Callister et al), untreated patients experienced a 50% progression per year.

Anyway, here&#039;s the mistake the authors make in their power analysis (used to determine the needed sample size).  The authors write: &quot;With regard to the sample size, a reduction of LDL cholesterol levels by 20% was expected in the 80-mg atorvastatin group compared with the 10-mg atorvastatin group. On the basis of results presented by Callister et al16 with a regression coefficient of 0.6, a difference of 10% between treatment groups was expected for progression of the CAC volume score.&quot;  Unfortunately for the authors, if you look at the regression in Callister et al, it&#039;s a regression of the change in plaque on the *level* of LDL cholesterol.  But what the authors need for their power analysis is a regression on the *change* in LDL, a very different thing, so their power analysis is wrong and they used too small a sample size.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did mean it as a serious question. What&#039;s the answer?

&quot;The sample size was much too small to detect the expected effects.&quot; The sample size was about 500 people. You seem to be saying that the effect was so small that an experiment -- not a survey, an experiment -- of thousands of subjects would have been necessary to detect it. Experimental psychologists routinely find reliable effects with n = 8. The beneficial effect of lime juice on scurvy was noticed with n = about 10. The idea that such an effect -- one that requires a year-long experiment with thousands of subjects to detect -- is large is new to me.

&quot;The main reason is they were testing high-dose versus low-dose statins&quot;. The amount of progression they measured was what you&#039;d expect from people taking no statins. Suggesting that neither the high nor the low dose had an effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;why did the study I discuss fail to find a difference in plaque build up between a high dose and a low dose?&lt;/i&gt;

I could explain why I think their power analysis was incorrect, and hence the sample size was much too small to detect the expected effects.  But I doubt you mean this as a serious question, so I&#039;ll just give a general answer.  The main reason is that they were testing high-dose vs. low-dose statins, rather than statins vs. a placebo, so one can expect smaller effects that are harder to detect with a small sample.  Of course, they designed the study that way because the benefits of statins have become so widely accepted in the medical community that it would now be unethical to test statins vs. placebo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Some studies have found that moderate smoking can help prevent Alzheimer&#039;s in certain groups of people. &lt;/i&gt;

We know little about the causes of Alzheimer&#039;s and I doubt we have much idea about how smoking might prevent it, so of course we shouldn&#039;t be convinced by one study.  

But we know tons about the causes of heart attacks (e.g., blood clots lodging in plaque-narrowed arteries), and we know tons about how statins suppress one cause of heart attacks (statins suppress plaque build-up).   That really ought to be enough to convince us of the benefits: studies that show that statins actually do prevent heart attacks are just icing on the cake.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the reference. You write: &quot;many studies have shown that statins reduce this plaque buildup&quot;. If it&#039;s so clear and repeatable, why did the study I discuss fail to find a difference in plaque build up  between a high dose and a low dose? As far as I can tell, the authors expected a difference -- agreeing with you -- but they didn&#039;t find one. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;in seven years’ time there is a one chance in about 120 that your death will have been prevented&lt;/i&gt;

Yes, if you only examine *direct evidence from randomized clinical trials*, you can only show that statins have this (pretty important) benefit for those with some cardiovascular risk factors.  But why do we have to limit ourselves to this tiny slice of the evidence?  

In fact, there is every reason to believe that statins are even more beneficial when taken for decades.  Many heart attacks and strokes are caused when blood clots lodge in arteries that have been narrowed by plaque buildup.  Many studies have shown that statins reduce this plaque buildup (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9264419&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;).  Applying the slightest bit of deduction to these facts, we can conclude that statins, taken over many decades by those moderately at risk, are likely to reduce the incidence of heart attack and strokes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;&gt; ...statins are awesomely effective in preventing a second heart attack (in people who’ve already had a first). Just that, plus the fact that statins seem to work by preventing plaque build-up in the arteries suggests that long-term use by those at moderate risk is likely to be highly beneficial. &lt;&lt;&lt;

I think it&#039;s the leap from your first sentence to your second one that many find objectionable.  There are studies that show benefit for certain high-risk individuals.  But none that show benefit for healthy people, and many that show harm.  Assuming that something that makes sense for high-risk people also makes sense for low-risk people just doesn&#039;t logically follow.

Some studies have found that moderate smoking can help prevent Alzheimer&#039;s in certain groups of people.  Should we extrapolate from this that the general population should begin to smoke moderately in order to prevent Alzheimer&#039;s?  Obviously not.]]></description>
