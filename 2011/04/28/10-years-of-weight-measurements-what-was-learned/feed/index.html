		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,
I just read this article by Stephan Guyenet in which he talks about body fat set point as a function of flavor. He references a rat study which showed that rats overate if given a chocolate drink but not with strawberry-flavored or vanilla-flavored drinks.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be interested to see this data expanded horizontally, with smaller units on the x axis, particularly in light of the &quot;no reason at all&quot; weight drops. It&#039;s possible that the &quot;random&quot; weight drops are related to changes in long-cycle circadian rhythms (on the order of seasons, not days). There are other well-established long-cycle circadian rhythms, and it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if increased amounts of daylight slightly altered metabolism in such a way as to reduce energy stores, whereas decreased total daylight levels might be associated with small anabolic basal metabolic changes.]]></description>
