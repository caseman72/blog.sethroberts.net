		<description><![CDATA[This strikes me as a too-theoretical critique. Sure, people lie, and scales break. In my experience, all forms of measurement have weaknesses and limitations. The comparison with perfection (&quot;people lie&quot;) doesn&#039;t interest me for that reason. Self-report is used with success very often in social psychology, clinical psychology, and psychophysics. If the critics of self-report would point to examples where self-report was misleading, that would interest me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Self-reporting isn&#039;t unreliable because it&#039;s subjective, it&#039;s unreliable because people lie/signal. For example people tend to underreport the number of calories they eat. Calories in isn&#039;t &quot;subjective&quot; (compared to, say, &quot;Do you eat well?&quot;), but people lie to both themselves and whoever they&#039;re reporting to because they want to be seen as someone who eats less.

But even if you lie to yourself, as long as you do it in a consistent fashion, you could still see progress over time. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry if this double-posts.  My first attempt at posting didn&#039;t seem to work.

Seth, the &quot;Buttermind&quot; study didn&#039;t seem to reveal anything interesting, until you log-transformed the data (a straight linear plot didn&#039;t reveal much).  Is transforming data a technique that you would recommend to people who don&#039;t have formal training in statistics?  If so, what kind of concise guidelines can you provide?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I use R to store my data. It stores it in a structure that R calls a &quot;data frame&quot; -- like a matrix, except that the columns can be different data types. For example, one column can be text, another numbers. I like R because it gives me great flexibility of data analysis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you have a preferred method of storing your data, like perhaps a plain ol&#039; spreadsheet?  I&#039;ve been tracking my weight in a free calorie counting program (cron-o-meter) that creates the pretty graph for me without any additional work - I know creating a graph in excel is easy once you&#039;ve done it a few times but might be a pretty big barrier to entry for a lot of people.

I don&#039;t have a fancy smart phone yet but there exists a great opportunity for someone to build a powerful self-experimentation app..if there isn&#039;t already one.]]></description>
