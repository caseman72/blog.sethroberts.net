		<description><![CDATA[I thought triangulate meant to form a triangle, the two ears being two tips of the triangle and the origin of the sound the third point.

To increase hearing sensitivity, a technique I learned was to open my mouth wide, and look at where the sound was coming from.  I haven&#039;t tested this with rigor, but it seems to work.  Opening the mouth seems to give me a more specific location on the vertical axis of origin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason bats have such weirdly shaped ears is exactly as q describes. There&#039;s a whole chapter devoted to them in The Blind Watchmaker.

A tiger&#039;s growl is low-frequency enough to do the phase difference; high-frequency sounds don&#039;t refract around the head so well, and the brain does amplitude difference instead. Mid-range sounds are harder to locate.]]></description>
