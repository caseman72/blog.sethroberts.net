		<description><![CDATA[How many species of &quot;good&quot; bacteria are in our gut?  I think I read at least 150 different species.  Do fermented foods, or even the best probiotics, normally come near supplying that many species?  I don&#039;t think so.  On this protocol, you are killing bacteria every few hours (take the Vitamin C and salt with meals).  Can you really repopulate your gut with such an aggressive protocol?  Don&#039;t get me wrong...if you KNOW that you&#039;ve got Lymes, it would be worth the risk.  I have some of the symptoms that the Chronic Lyme people suggest indicates Lyme disease (including some lab results), but it&#039;s such a long laundry list that just about anybody could have Lymes, based upon that.  

According to the website, it might be necessary to persist with this protocol for up to 3 years.  What kind of havoc could that play on your gut bacteria?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have hear different view on &quot;Chronic&quot; Lyme.  A lot of people say that it doesn&#039;t exist. That is the mainstream position that may or may not be right.  IA few years ago, I was diagnosed with Lyme and even got Lab results from Igenex lab that indicate I have Lyme and Babesia.  I was sent to a &quot;Lyme specialist&quot; who put me on an expensive protocol.  I became frustrated because of a severe reaction to the antibiotics prescribed and because I was confused as to whether or not &quot;Chronic Lyme&quot; even exists.

I am tempted to try this protocol (aafter all, it&#039;s cheap) except for one thing.  Wouldn&#039;t it cause just as much gut dysbiosis as a course of antibiotics?  What do you think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Coming up with and publicizing a new way to cure Lyme disease is a &quot;really harmful thing&quot; because it didn&#039;t say you should measure your blood pressure? Perhaps the author of that website felt it was obvious. Or perhaps he himself did not get high blood pressure from the salt he was eating. Both of those would call your outrage (&quot;idiots&quot;) into question. However, I agree with you to a certain extent. As I said, the author of that website should make it easy for others to share their experiences. Whether that often includes high blood pressure remains to be seen.

In the case of RLS, you seem to fail to understand that if your RLS is cured by taking iron supplements, it is likely you had an iron deficiency to start with. People who have iron deficiencies and then take iron are unlikely to get heart damage from doing so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the big problems with the personal science movement you espouse is that idiots on the internet can suggest really harmful things. This is one of them. Nowhere on that website does it say that you should monitor your blood pressure, and if you&#039;re eating that much salt 4 times a day, you really should be monitoring your blood pressure.

Another example: all over the internet people talk about the few papers which link iron deficiency with RLS. The problem is, that&#039;s only for _some_ class of RLS patients, and it&#039;s not easy to get iron levels tested on your own. Taking supplemental iron pills, which I&#039;ve seen recommended on RLS fora all over the place, can cause long term heart damage. 

If you don&#039;t publicly talk about this kind of thing, and suggest or discuss ideas to remediate it, you are part of the problem, since you are strongly recommending to people that they try things like this. One reason doctors are so cautious is liability. I think this post is pretty close to something that should be considered liable if people read it, go and eat salt until they have strokes.]]></description>
