		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if this has been mentioned in the comments to previous entries, but Rescuetime does this automatically.  It tracks what program you&#039;re in, or even what website you visit, and allows you to say what you were doing when not on the computer.

When I was having trouble focusing at work, I downloaded it, and it greatly increased my productivity.  Just knowing that I was 20% more productive than the average user was a strong motivator to keep it up.  It also immediately showed me where I was wasting time and what days were the most productive, so I could tweak my work schedule to optimize this (I was best right when I got into the office and the few hours before I left, so I tried to get meetings in the middle of the day).]]></description>
