		<description><![CDATA[Nothing to complain about here Seth. You were given the money back, no hassel. Besides, GV is a free, but I&#039;m almost 100% sure that when you first sign up for GV you have to provide a credit card # as ID.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was recently forced by Google to cancel my YouTube and Blogspot accounts, even though I had had both accounts since before Google took over those sites. Why? Because Google wanted my phone number in order to let me log in to MY OWN Blogspot site that I&#039;d had for like 2 years already. I don&#039;t give my phone number to drunks in bars, creepy guys who hit on me in the library, or anyone else who has no business calling me. The only reasonable response to a dick move like that was to cancel my Google account (which I NEVER signed up for, but apparently got by default when they took over my youtube and blogspot accounts). Cancelling the Google account that I did not sign up for also cancelled (I had no choice about it) my Blogspot, and my Youtube accounts. 

A few weeks ago, I thought Google was a pretty great search engine, and had no negative feelings about it. Now, I find Google creepy in the extreme, just like the smelly 50-year-old men who hit on me in the library when I was 16 (gross!). I don&#039;t use the search engine any more. Other search engines turn out to be completely sufficient for my needs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A similar thing happened to me where I received a receipt for a pair of sunglasses purchased through Google Checkout.  I investigated, but the charge had reversed itself.  I have never given my credit card to Checkout now used it in my life. 

Google is really screwing up in the privacy area lately, but at least now that Schmidt has taken a back seat from CEO, the public face of Google won&#039;t be as creepy.  The man just radiates creepiness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google knows everything!

I took a look under my own Account Settings and I don&#039;t have a My Products listed.  I guess this means that something you have used seems to have opted  you in for the My Products and - I guess - added your credit card in too.

Scary.  Big Google is watching you!]]></description>
