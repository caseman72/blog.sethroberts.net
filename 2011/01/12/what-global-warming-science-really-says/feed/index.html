		<description><![CDATA[I seem to recall that climate modelers predicted in the &#039;90s that it would be noticeably warmer today than it was then.  Sure enough, it is, and by the amount they predicted (i.e., their worst-case scenario, which is what the data really indicated).   Lately, every year is, or matches, the warmest on record.  What makes that not a successful prediction?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[M, a few years during the 1930s were also really hot. If you leave aside the models, the rest of the data doesn&#039;t make a good case that it is so much hotter than ever before we should be concerned. If that website had started by realizing the models are worthless, I might trust it. Since that website takes the models seriously, I don&#039;t trust it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your approach sounds reasonable (ie, &quot;falling back on data that bears on the question without needing a model&quot;).  You point to the Medieval Warm Period.  The skepticalscience list that you linked to says: &quot;Globally temperatures are warmer than they have been during the last 2000 years.&quot;   http://www.skepticalscience.com/medieval-warm-period.htm]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I experienced the same unnecessary complexity while working in the industry of oil field simulations. The argument for it was always &quot;The customer wants features.&quot;

I doubled the accuracy of the simulations just by inventing a simpler and more accurate venturi model, with fewer variables and more realistic behavior. 

The reactions to this was a brutally hard lesson in practical psychology for me. The customer demanded endless amounts of new documentation instead of just asking why it worked better and paying for that information. The new boss tried to fire me for producing too little code. The supposed expert on the original code claimed my job should have taken a few hours, while never achieving anything like it himself. Eventually most employees there quit.

According to the anthropic principle, and my other job experiences, these events are typical. So I guess similar stuff happens in climate modeling, pharmaceutical research, economics, psychology research, whatever. I do not quite understand why this stuff happens, but I find it damn stupid.

As for following Ockhams advice of decreasing the number of entities, such as variables: There is another similar trick, which you obviously know, used a lot by JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber, that of making the model more robust as measured by sensitivity to variations in the variables. The entities that are decreased in both cases are the amount of data needed to describe the model, as the number of variables, or accuracy of variables.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[M, in the absence of reliable models I fall back on data that bears on the question without needing a model. In the case of climate change, current temperatures are not unprecedented -- the Medieval Warm Period, for example. That makes it harder to believe that humans are causing unprecedented warming. So the answer to your question is no, I would not be saying we should be worried about climate change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe you that complex models are often unreliable. But suppose mainstream scientists&#039; complex models were instead predicting a stable climate -- would you then be writing skeptical blog posts suggesting we should be afraid of climate change?]]></description>
