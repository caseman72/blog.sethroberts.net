		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for mentioning that, Justin. I was curious who runs the Mnemosyne Project but couldn&#039;t figure it out from the website. That they are collecting memory data makes it seem like an academic project -- something done by a professor somewhere.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I started using free software this month (http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/) to test you at gradually longer increments to help you get things in long-term memory. I don&#039;t have a firm ruling on its utility yet, but the potential seems strong enough that I am going to keep using it for at least a year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, in a classroom the difference is pretty obvious: students are taking a test or they aren&#039;t. With flash cards, I agree, you can hardly study them without testing yourself. But there are many other ways to study Chinese besides flash cards. When it comes to Chinese, the learn-by-testing advice isn&#039;t trivial. Should I spend 20 minutes staring at lists of English words and their Chinese counterparts, should I spend 20 minutes copying characters, should I spend 20 minutes listening to a tape, or should I spend 20 minutes testing myself?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand the distinction they make between studying and testing. When you take a vocabulary test, you&#039;re presented with some words and attempt to define/translate them. When you study vocabulary using flash cards, you look at a vocabulary word and attempt to define/translate it. So studying is often already a kind of testing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;an appreciation for learning that should begin in school and last a lifetime.&quot;
That sentence is so wrong that it could nearly only come from someone who&#039;s blinded by thinking academically.
All young children have a appreciation for learning. It&#039;s school that kills the appreciation instead of school that creates the appreciation.]]></description>
