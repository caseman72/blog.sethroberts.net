		<description><![CDATA[John, Jon Stewart commented on Sarah Palin&#039;s talent for turning criticism into victimization. It&#039;s the same with placebo effects. If something that should not have an effect does have an effect, it implies the experimenter doesn&#039;t understand what&#039;s going on. Exactly that, no more, no less. All that talk about placebo effects being due to &quot;expectations&quot; goes beyond the evidence. Yet somehow placebo effects are taken to mean the experimental subject is credulous. Medical researchers, in other words, are showing a talent for turning indications of their ignorance into indications of their sophistication (&quot;we controlled for placebo effects&quot;).
dearieme, thanks for bringing that article to my attention. My interpretation is that the skepticism of doctors (dismissing acupuncture, for example) isn&#039;t really skepticism, it&#039;s self-interest. When being credulous is in their self-interest (e.g., thinking statins are wonder drugs, without serious side effects), they&#039;re credulous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People, especially the elderly, often go to doctors for a bit of human contact when they feel isolated--drugs can&#039;t relieve social isolation on their own.  Some researchers are now looking at the placebo effect not only of drugs themselves but of the medical rituals of examining patients, prescribing, etc. For some depression, CBT is effective, and so is psychodynamic therapy--apparently roughly equivalent.  The human connection with the therapist is an important factor in healing.

		<description><![CDATA[I filed for a primary care physician during a summer in college.

I was shocked and disturbed by the prevalence of mental health issues with  the doctor&#039;s frequent visit patients.

I guess it sort of makes sense.  It&#039;s difficult for people suffering depression to make changes in their life and that leads to other medical issues. 

I&#039;m not sure what the answer is.  But it does seem like mental health drugs do not work as well as we once thought and that cognitive behavioral therapy is fairly effective.]]></description>
