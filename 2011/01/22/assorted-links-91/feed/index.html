		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;m curious if you&#039;ve every experimented with &quot;high meat&quot; (which I just heard of today.)  It&#039;s &#039;ultra-aged&#039; meat that&#039;s been allowed to turn.  People are reporting reduced susceptibility to colds, improved moods and energy, etc.

Here is one post, but if you search that forum for the phrase &quot;high meat&quot; (including the quotes) in the forum&#039;s Google Custom Search box you&#039;ll find a lot more.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Early on in Neverware&#039;s history, Hefter contacted Dell and Intel, eager to share with them his approach. It was the equivalent of calling the major oil companies to show them a design for a solar powered car. &#039;I also don&#039;t know that we&#039;d be interested in &quot;radically extending the life...of desktop PCs,&#039; was the reply Hefter got from a higher up at Intel.&quot;

Kind of like going to a school system (or--my God!--a School of Education) and saying you have a way of teaching the same amount in half the time.]]></description>
