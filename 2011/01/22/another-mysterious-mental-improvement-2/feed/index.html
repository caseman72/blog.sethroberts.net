		<description><![CDATA[I was told by a dentist that Mercury amalgam is quite safe because it is an alloy with another metal, so the atoms are bound together, so there is no direct contact with Mercury itself.

As a solid state physicist I know that is totally false. An amalgam is NOT an alloy. It is instead very thin layers of alternating pure metal, somewhat similar to the ridges in a finger print. This is what gives amalgams their flexibility and crack resistance.

So there is indeed direct contact by tongue, spit, and food to pure poisonous Mercury, making even worse chemical products.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, the hair test lab is Doctor&#039;s Data.

Alex, the doctor took precautions but of course I had no idea at the time how adequate they were. These results suggest they were adequate, in the sense that the removal seems to have done more good than harm.

Gunnar, good question but I don&#039;t know what the replacement material is. The dentist did a weird chiropractic procedure in which he put various materials in my hand and pushed down. That is silly and next time I should figure out what I want.

pip, since the change started in Berkeley the Berkeley/Beijing differences are not especially plausible.

Tyler, unlike doctors, who do not themselves take the drugs they prescribe, dentists are exposed to the materials they use. Mercury poisoning is a serious risk among dentists. I don&#039;t think anybody has claimed that the new substances wouldn&#039;t have any unintended side effects; they just thought the new substances were likely to be an improvement over doing nothing. For example, ether anesthesia. Our houses are full of new substances, such as plastics and metals. They aren&#039;t perfectly safe but they are on the whole improvements.

vic, that&#039;s a good question. I will look into it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested to see where this goes. Both my parents have mercury fillings without apparent problems, but perhaps there&#039;s room for improvement?

Over the last couple years I&#039;ve lost a lot of respect for the dental profession. Many of the practices seem rash- Mercury fillings, Fluoride applications, Bisphenol-A in all the resins/sealants... It strikes me as incredibly naive, to think that adding new substances such as these that have never been present for the last 2.5 million years of human evolutionary history in these quantities (or at all - BPA), won&#039;t have any unintended side effects. 

What do you think?
