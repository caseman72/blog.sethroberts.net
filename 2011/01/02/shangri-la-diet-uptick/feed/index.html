		<description><![CDATA[Just one day on the diet but am amazed how my hunger was diminished.  I&#039;m going to use Shangri La in conjunction with Dukan since I&#039;ve been eating way too much at night on Dukan (even though I&#039;m eating low -carb).  For those days on Dukan where I can restrict my calories somewhat, my results have definitely been better.  So I have great hopes if things continue to work as they have on this first day.
  I&#039;ve got an order in for the Shangri La book. Least I can do for what seems like a great idea.  Think it is unfair for some to ask you to put your book online (ie. more specific info and details about the diet) when you aren&#039;t even charging for web access.  What do some expect you to do, give everything away for free? Is that what they do with their businesses?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i think that&#039;s great.

seth, i have always had a really hard time navigating those forums.  it&#039;s also been hard to find a clear, succinct HOW TO / WHY description of the diet that i can tell people about.  even sorting by date doesn&#039;t work well -- it seems to sort by alphabetical month for example.

you might try invision boards as a better alternative?

(it worked for me -- i lost 20 pounds in the first half of last year with virtually no effort on the diet after losing 10 the previous year with huge effort, and i have kept it off -- i may try for another 10 at some point, but i&#039;m pretty happy with where i am.)]]></description>
