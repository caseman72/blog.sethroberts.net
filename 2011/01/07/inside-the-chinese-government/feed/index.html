		<description><![CDATA[revelo, I agree completely.

Contemplationist, yes, expensive regulation is a wonderfully effective tool that benefits large corporations at the expense of small ones. Food safety laws, for example, require an office for a food safety inspector in certain cases. Small companies cannot afford this, big companies can. But that does not change the overall point that, as the examples given by revelo suggest, governments really do make it harder for the strong to exploit the weak. You may not have heard of the Wallenbergs.

They are an incredibly wealthy and powerful Swedish family. I asked my Swedish uncle how they compare to the Swedish government. &quot;They act as a brake on each other,&quot; he said.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Many people, such as Hayek and Milton Friedman, want less government. But I have yet to hear one of them answer the point that if government becomes too weak, rich people will control it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seth, you need to get out more. The field is called &quot;Public Choice Economics&quot; and is now 40 years old. Its dedicated to answering precisely how BIG government is controlled by &quot;rich people.&quot; Whatever happened to criticizing the nexus between Wall St and the government? Or Big Agriculture n Govt? Or Big Pharma and FDA? I mean, are you kidding or this argument for real? Unless you are claiming that we currently have laissez-faire, all these instances are strikes AGAINST big government. 

The libertarian argument is that regulation does not control &quot;rich people&quot; or corporations but gives them more levers to loot the common man. The most effective controller or regulator of corporations is OTHER corporations that compete with them. The key thing to focus on is keeping dynamic, open markets with as low cost-of-entry as possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absent a strong democratic government, the rich mutate into feudal lords. That is, they set up their own non-democratic government, and they oppress their subjects far worse than under our current society. The subjects can&#039;t leave because there is always a hierarchy of slaves, guards and boss at the top, such that the boss treats the guards well in exchange for controlling the slaves. This is how things were in Latin America or the American south for that matter back in the good old days that the libertarians pine for. These libertarians better make sure they&#039;ve arranged to fall into the guard or boss group before exchanging our current flawed democracy for feudalism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth

If you think that a  Strong Government is one that can do what the hell it pleases, and conversely a Weak Government is one which cannot necessarily do so, you have comingled as weak both the government which is constrained by constitutional checks and balances, within which it can indeed  get done what it pleases (Hayek, Friedman); and the government which may be less constrained in priciple, but due to corruption or special-interest-group influence or exaggerated ambition, fails to enforce the law, fails to put its policies into effect, and / or cannot sequester the resources to fulfill its plans. Of course special interests (including &#039;the rich&#039;) will try to overthrow the constraints on the first type, bringing about the second type. The answer is to defend the pinciple and actuality of constitutional constraints on government. 
 
 
 In terms of how &#039;the rich&#039; can control you without government, it simply comes down to they can offer you money to do something you wouldn&#039;t otherwise do. They can&#039;t make you do it, not in the way the government can, with its legislation, policemen, judges, jails and executioners. 
Actually your list applies pretty well to government too:
 Bribe teachers - don&#039;t need to, just control what they teach and how 
 Ruin your local economy - actually with misguided policy they can ruin the whole economy, not just the local one
 Threaten to fire if you don&#039;t do X or Y - Yes for government employees and through extensive regulation for many many others
 Cheating you in business - No need to cheat, just take your money in taxes
 Pollution - Does the government police its own pollution as rigourously as everyone else&#039;s?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am with Thomas. it is very true. I mean &quot;THE RICH&quot; would so be the government plus if you see pictures of china they don&#039;t maintain it like cuba but cuba is much worse. because in china the place that the tourist see is very nice but behind it it is very messy. Like cuba.
Tahnks for reading!

		<description><![CDATA[I dunno - there are just wrong assumptions in every line of this post.

First off: I&#039;ll never get why people believe in what their politicians say. Shouldn&#039;t history taught us by now? Well I guess the Chinese don&#039;t - they know the system is rigged.
But why on earth believe Obama&#039;s words? Look as his actions: He has done nothing he promised. But he is not weak (just look at what Bush did with less political power) - he just never intended to. That shouldn&#039;t be surprising to anyone.

Rich people in China do pretty well. I doubt most of them fear the government - because ... I mean, I&#039;m no expert, but I bet that the most of the rich ARE the government.

And about the idea that &quot;if government becomes too weak, rich people will control it&quot; ... well: then it wouldn&#039;t matter, right? The problem is that companies in the US love big government - and want big government (despite saying otherwise). Just not for the people - only for themselves. So they get constant subsidies and bails if in trouble.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first thing missing from this discussion is a definition of strong central government.  If you agree that a central government can be small but effective, then its court system is what must be strong.  With a monopoly on force and an effective judicial system, then you have an ideal scenario.  Moreover, the debate between strong and weak central authorities overlooks many important factors such as state and local governments which provide regional protections of property.  Beyond the system of organization, there is the human population and population genetics.  There can be little doubt that people of British descent possess a positive combination of behaviors that leads to greater individuality and acceptance of freedom while also respecting the property rights of others.  Taken together, it makes any comparison far more difficult.  

In any case, your suggestions that big corporations can degrade education through bribes or cheating other people are behaviors that were long ago forbidden in the English system.  Having a government serve as protector of life and property is not new and does not mean that it has to be large.  The remainder of the methods you suggest corporations could control the rest of us, are specious.  If a firm sells bad products, then people won&#039;t buy.  There is nothing for which there is not a realistic substitute, so if a firm invents something and achieves 20 year monopoly control, the public can likely just buy something else.  Moreover, people are not going to buy the item if it is not good, when they have unlimited alternatives for spending their cash.  The issues of pollution and libertarianism are more difficult to solve, no doubt.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How the rich can control you without government: By degrading your education (e.g., bribing teachers). By ruining your local economy (so you must move away to get a job). By threatening to fire you if you don&#039;t do X or Y. By making your workplace less safe. By lowering your salary. By selling crummy products. By cheating you in a business transaction. By lending you so much money at such bad terms that you spend the rest of your life doing payback. By polluting a river from which you drink. By polluting air you breathe. To give just a few examples.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand: If government is weak, how do rich people control me? Government has a monopoly on force and thereby can tell me what to do, or else. Without that they can&#039;t. So how do rich people exercise control over me without co-opting government?

I can only see how the rich exercise control over me via government. Perhaps there are other ways I don&#039;t see?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Paul, I&#039;m not saying China&#039;s way is preferable to America&#039;s way. I am saying it is different. Both countries have government enterprises (a minority of people) and non-government enterprises (most people). In both countries, people outside government are wealthy. In America, wealthy people outside government do not fear government officials. In China, they do. The financial crisis -- in which a large number of wealthy Americans gambled using taxpayer money and caused great unemployment -- suggests that there is a problem with American governance. Obviously there is a problem with Chinese governance -- the vast corruption, for example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The comparison seems to me to be  a strange one.  While there are rich people in China who aren&#039;t officially members of the CCCP, aren&#039;t almost all high ranking members of the CCCP rich?  As well, didn&#039;t most of the non party wealthy in China obtain their wealth through their guanxin?  I thought that the story of China was more or the less the same as the story of Russia.  The state privatizes the assets of public companies, but sells them at a favorable price to those who are politically well connected, who in turn funnel large amounts of cash and other resources to party member.  The same thing happens in real estate development, and basically with anything that needs approval from the government, which, from what I understand, is most anything that would stand to make you wealthy.  So, I don&#039;t really see how this is preferable to the way the U.S. does things.  I think that it is correct to infer from Hong Kong and Singapore that governments must be actively involved in an economy if it is to be productive.  However, Hong Kong and Signapore have not been governed in the same manner that China has, and hence they are notably much less corrupt.  Lee Kwan Yeu may want to believe that leaders of the CCCP wish to emulate him, and some may want that, but I have a suspicion that even more want to emulate Putin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Zubon, yes, my hypothesis is that the realistic choice is between a government like the one we have now (in the US) or a stronger government (as in China). An example is financial regulation. Brooksley Born argued for stronger regulation; she was dismissed by people, such as Larry Summers, who gave free-market arguments. Summers pointed out the number of wealthy bankers that agreed with him (&quot;there are thirteen bankers in my office...&quot;). That is a specific example where a stronger government would have been less controllable by rich people. On the other hand, the reason I raise this issue at all is not to preach about it -- I don&#039;t have strong opinions -- but to ask . . . I really do wonder what people who believe in smaller government say to the problem of control by rich people.

&quot;A weak central authority is not worth exploiting.&quot; What did Hammurabi and Moses have in common? Both offered protection. This is why people supported them, I surmise. The weaker the central authority, the less it can protect people. The financial crisis is one sign of how much protection we need. Another is the obesity epidemic, if it is due to the growth of the processed food industry. Perhaps China will have both -- a financial crisis and an obesity epidemic -- in which case it will be clear that a strong government is not the answer. Perhaps China can avoid a financial crisis but it is less clear it can avoid an obesity epidemic, a diabetes epidemic, a lung-cancer epidemic, and so on.]]></description>
