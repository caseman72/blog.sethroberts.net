Promoting a new brand for a small biz or one of the well known brands we are all familiar with.OK Having said all that I enjoy doing a real showy demo.I like to gather a crowd and break down the cost as I cook with the ingrdient or product.I would love you to send me good info as to how to do this myself.]]></description>
