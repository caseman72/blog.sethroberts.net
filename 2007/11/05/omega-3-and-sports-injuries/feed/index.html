My experience with 3T/day of flax seed oil have been more or less identical to his -- before: high doses of NSAIDs just to survive training, constant soreness and fatigue, &amp;c.; after: no joint pain at all, complete discontinuation of NSAIDs, lower frequency and severity of injury.  I&#039;d really like to see a large-N peer-reviewed study on this effect, which I speculate is caused by the influence of omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid balance on eicosanoid production.

		<description><![CDATA[[...] This is a new idea in nutrition (at least, new to me). It is supported by and explains some of the most interesting data I&#8217;ve posted. It explains why Tyler Cowen&#8217;s gums got so much better so quickly &#8212; because he was taking almost exactly the best amount of flaxseed oil for his gums. Tyler chose his intake of flaxseed oil based on my behavioral data, which suggested the best amount was between 2 and 3 tablespoons/day. The gums and the brain could hardly be more different, but the best level for the brain turned out to do a wonderful job of healing his gums. Same thing with Anonymous and sports injuries.
