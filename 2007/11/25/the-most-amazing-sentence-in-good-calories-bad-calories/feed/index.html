		<description><![CDATA[I think the point of the book was that we tend to get dogmatic about all of this instead of looking at the facts. We don&#039;t have all the facts yet. In the context of set points, even though there is evidence that they exist in the human body, we still cannot prove that they do. It is very hard to prove until we understand how all of the related factors correspond on the entire system. This is not religion we are talking about, though and we cannot go on faith. It has to be based on science. I think that was the point of the book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The appetite regulating mechanism is probably far more complex and variable than any of us currently imagine. There&#039;s grehlin and leptin and insulin, all interacting to regulate hunger and satiety and fuel availability. 

Probably, then, the biggest hindrance to developing a good working model of the appetite regulating mechanism is the biochemical variability of the metabolic machinery in cells and the physiological variability of the various organs of digestion, absorption, and hormonal regulation. Taking data on all of this variability with all of its attendant uncertainties and making statistical sense of it is a major challenge for modern science. Perhaps we shouldn&#039;t argue passionately about particulars at this point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Still not convinced there is a disagreement of substance. Taubes is not denying that you can intervene in homoestatic systems; you can reduce body temperature with aspirin or cold. Or even change the depth of a lake. He is just saying the regulatory system may be the whole body itself rather then a thermostatic system in the brain, a little homunculus in charge of things. The existence of the system for hunger control is to me, undeniable; and god knows we can intervene in it, but whether there is the equivalent of a thermostat in the brain may be an open question. The causal system may resemble a thermostatic system without their being some special mechanism &quot;in the brain&quot; that &quot;sets&quot; hunger levels. 

Yes, thinking of it in the way you do may lead heuristically to better interventions. It actually seems kind of conceptually tricky because we have a biochemical neurological system interacting with consciousness -- awareness of flavors and memory of previous flavors -- so straight biochemical concepts are not quite enough. The thermostat has no consciousness; it&#039;s straight chemistry. The brain/body does... 

John Searle claims there is a lot of intellectual confusion because people confuse behaving according to a rule, and following a rule... 


Assuming all of this makes it easier to intervene. You are making a conceptualist argument; there is a system that can be intervened upon sure, I guess the question is whether it &quot;sets&quot; a hunger level the way a thermostat does, or whether what is set, is constantly changing, which is where the metaphor breaks down... Of course thinking about it this way enables you to intervene; it clearly is a system of causal forces, analogous to a thermostat... 

Part of the system can be destroyed and it no longer regulates; a person can have a stroke and their temperature regulation system can fail... Whether there is a homunculus in the brain, or just a more diffuse systemic bodily system. Taubes would not deny that you can intervene in the other systems; you can lower body temperature with aspirin or cold packs; you can lower hunger by getting calories without taste, or sugar water (the latter would blow Taubes&#039; mind).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why does it matter whether there is a &quot;thermostat in the brain&quot;? That Taubes is wrong about something pretty obvious makes it more plausible to me that he wrong about something less obvious -- whether there is a set point for weight.

If you think there is a set point for weight you can entertain the possibility that the set point is adjustable. If you think it is adjustable you can entertain the possibility that it is adjusted based on environmental conditions (as Cabanac concluded the temperature set point is). If you believe in an adjustable set point based on environmental conditions you can begin to wonder what the exact rule is. The more detailed your theory, the easier it is to derive predictions that you can test.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find it hard to know how much of this is semantic. Science often proceeds by understanding biological functioning in terms of technology. We didn&#039;t know the heart was a pump until someone invented a pump; that is not metaphoric -- the heart actually is a pump of sorts. I&#039;m told that radar technology helped get the mind back into psychology in the 1940s...

Understanding weight control in terms of a thermostat may just be a metaphorical mapping where some parts hold but others do not. There is a regulatory system with causal interactions that can be identified -- exposure to poorly learned tastes reduces hunger, to strongly learned ones increases it; enduring hunger and losing weight (in my view) increases &quot;sensitivity&quot; or readiness for the system to learn or respond to taste-calorie associations -- but how much does it really matter if we add the notion of an entity, a noun, &quot;a thermostat in the brain&quot;. If we find some controlling mechanism in the brain that does that, fine. And is there really a &quot;point&quot; that the &quot;brain&quot; sets in some way? Is this a metaphor? Or is there just a set of causally interactive processes at work that are easier to understand if we talk this way? When do we need to say that there is a central regulator regulating a biological system and when do we say there is just a system that regulates itself? Does positing a &quot;thermostat in the brain&quot; explain the system or merely re-describe it? Perhaps that will only be known if one is identified. Or is it obvious that there *must* be one given the functioning of other neurobiological systems?

How do we empirically determine the difference between a system that merely behaves as if there were a thermostat in the brain and a system where there actually is one? Ad nauseum...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another example is re blood sugar levels. Dr Bernstein writes about sampling thousands of normal blood sugar levels, and finding them all at 83, +/-3.

Some of this may be a mater of semantics, though, rather than disagreement about mechanisms. The set point for blood sugar appears to primarily due to pancreatic machinery that is &quot;set&quot; for 83, rather than something in the brain per se. Still, the brain is intimately connected to glucose homeostasis, and controls diet and cephalic-phase insulin when you eat familiar foods.]]></description>
