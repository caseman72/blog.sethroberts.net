		<description><![CDATA[I have been looking for information on what has happened to me since I began to take omega 3,6,9,   I have had surgery for a Chiari malfoamation in my brain, and have ruptured all of the disc in my neck. Needless to say I have lived in pain for the last 7 years. my normal routine for taking pain meds is lyrica (antiimflamitory),ultram (pain) and a muscle relaxiant 2x daily and inbetween I would lay on icepac and take ibprofen. The pain was bareable but never gone. I had been taking omega 3 and seen some relief but I still hurt. I went to sams and found the omega 3,6,9, on sale so I decided to get some the first night I took it and when I got up I was pain free, so I took it again in the morning making me take 2x the sudjested dose daily. I have seen my pain get better and this last weekend when I held my sick grandson for the whole weekend I hurt but after a day of rest I was back to having relief and it usually would have taken a week for me to get back to my normal pain level. I have quit taking my morning meds and am planning on weening off of my night pain meds. Praise be to God for creating a body that would respond to foods so well. I look forward to being my drugfree self again soon for the first time in over 7 years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you people are funny.
suspecting flax seed oil is causing or fixing all your problems.
crackpots are too many.

I wouls strongly look into the daily amounts that you consume. everybody is different.
I read several sources claiming 2-3 grams is best, exceeding does not add any more benifits, possibly triggering reactions or side effects at higher doses.

for me I take a small teasppon of flax seed oil daily, or around 2 grams.. 
reason being..
duh!
eat fish soy, tofu tempeh and you get mor eomega three on top..
getting different omega three from fish is a nice way to add more.

oh oh..i have an elbow pain...could be I am not drinking enough flax see oil?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been taking fish oil 3x a day for the past month and a half.  A week ago, I just sprained my ankle worse than ever before.  It&#039;s still purple and swollen, tender to the touch.  Clearly omega-3 delays the healing of more internal wounds and soft-tissue growth.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been taking the flax seed oil for several months, now; I was at 2 tablespoons and have gone to 4 in the last 3 weeks. I&#039;ve had bad gums for years. 2 months ago I had gum surgery. My orthodontist warned me that it would take a long time to heal and there might be problems with one area. When I returned after 2 weeks she said, &quot;I&#039;m surprised! It&#039;s healing very well!&quot;

Then when I returned after 2 months, she said, &quot;You&#039;re doing very well! You must be working very hard to keep your gums in shape!&quot;

The truth is I have not been working that hard, not been doing everything she recommended, at best doing what&#039;s adequate. It seems to be the flax seed oil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I take flax seed oil, I get something similar to a sinus headache- like something in the oil is causing a histimine reaction.  The longest I&#039;ve been able to take it was two weeks.  I noticed an improvement in my gums, but that strange headache feeling masked any other improvements.

I&#039;m hoping I can avoid the adverse reaction by finding a different source of Omega-3s.]]></description>
