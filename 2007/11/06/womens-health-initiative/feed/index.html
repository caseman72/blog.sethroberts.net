		<description><![CDATA[Does anyone know why they chose 49,000 participants, which is an astoundingly large number? It seems that kind of number would pop out of a power calculation if you expected the effect to be very small and/or the background variation to be very large. If its the former, it makes the interesting point that the study cost will be decreasing in the magnitude of the effect you expect to find. This isn&#039;t to say that some very small effects might have a big social benefit and that you would want to know about them, but it is still a perverse property of research!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reasonable point. I quoted too selectively and misled you about what the author meant. You are right, by one meaning of &quot;quietly buried&quot; they were not. The author meant they received far less coverage than they would have had they come out differently. She meant &quot;by comparison, they were quietly buried.&quot; That isn&#039;t clear from the single sentence I quoted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

The original quote was that the results were &quot;quietly buried.&quot;  you may believe the results deserved wider coverage, but that&#039;s quite different than suggesting they were &quot;quietly buried.&quot;  I do think publication in one of the pre-eminent medical journals and coverage in a pre-eminent newspapers is ample evidence against quiet burial.]]></description>

If they didn&#039;t exist, we would be able to trust our bodies and eat well.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;When we enjoy a variety of foods from all of the food groups â€” as most everyone naturally does when theyâ€™re not trying to control their eating â€” and trust our bodies, weâ€™ll get the nutrients we need to prevent deficiencies.&quot;

There is something pleasantly Jane Jacobs like or Hayekian in that statement (very anti-central planning/anti-expertise).  

But sadly, in my personal experience, if I let myself spontaneously choose what I want to eat, I&#039;ll eat very unhealthy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rich, coverage in the NY Times (once?) doesn&#039;t make your point. Was it covered on the Today show? Good Morning America? Oprah? A hundred other places?

How much coverage did it deserve? Well, the notion that Americans have been given poor nutrition advice for a long time is very important -- had the advice been better, lots of lives would be better. I think the results deserved lots of discussion about &quot;where we went wrong&quot; or &quot;where the experts went wrong&quot; or &quot;where the funding system went wrong&quot; -- whatever you want to call it. There was none of that.]]></description>
