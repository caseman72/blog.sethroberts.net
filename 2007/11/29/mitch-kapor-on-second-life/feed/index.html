		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t had a cold like this -- obvious symptoms, lasting a week -- in about 10 years, ever since I started standing a lot, etc. But it isn&#039;t completely surprising because recently my sleep has been the worse it&#039;s been in a very long time. I don&#039;t know why. So in a way this new cold supports my idea that better sleep = more resistance to colds.

To get reliably better sleep by standing I found I had to stand about 8 hours. Below that the effects were unclear.

No new developments on the sleep/immunity connection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth -- interesting post, but also noticing that you report having a cold, and recall you had gone I think several years without one having virtually perfected your sleep.  Has the record been broken for a while?

Any new thoughts/commentsdevelopments in this sleep/immunity situation?  Would be interested to hear.  I have tried the standing technique and not achieved similar improvements in my sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The quote from the forums is wonderful and something I can relate to. I&#039;m around 100 pounds lighter than I used to be now, and have ranged from 80-100 pounds lighter for more than 2 years. I still get a thrill when I see people I haven&#039;t seen for a long time,  usually acquaintances or people who I&#039;m friendly with but not exactly friends. I start talking with them, they wonder who the hell I am and then go through a shock of recognition -- &quot;Tim?!&quot;

And at a dinner party a few months ago with a number of people who had weight problems present, a woman I was meeting for the first time asked, &quot;Have you *always* been thin? How do you do it?&quot; I delight in being asked that. 

I have not had the experience of a new job with people who only know me as thin. That must be interesting, like taking on a social identity...
Cheers!]]></description>
