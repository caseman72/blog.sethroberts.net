		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps off topic, but I recall reading years ago that said traditionally Chinese use honey to help with dieting and weight loss.  Now I have always loved honey and have never found that it diminished my appetite in the least.  But then I put it on top of toast.  I find the SLD matches my observations and anecdotal experiences over the years.  Our Western diet patterns clearly increase our appetites.  The oil approach decreases my appetite and that is all I ask for.  I&#039;m reluctant to try the sugar water approach just yet.  Honey may also work just fine if it&#039;s used in an SLD pattern, but I&#039;m going to stay with what&#039;s working for the moment.]]></description>
