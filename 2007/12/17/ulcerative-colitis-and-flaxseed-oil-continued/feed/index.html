		<description><![CDATA[Alice, you needn&#039;t worry about the effect flaxseed oil will have on the diet. Because it is a super-unsaturated omega 3 oil, the fatty acids are oxidised at such a rate that intake of omega 3 oils actually increase the metabolic rate. It is for this, and their anti-inflammatory effect amongst others, that I recommend omega 3 oils to all my clients. Should this be in the form of flaxseed oil, I would suggest around 20-30ml per day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am worried that having the flax oil when on a low calorie diet will compromise the diet. Am I being a neurotic fool or is Flax oil a very high calorie addition to diet? I heard that it stimulated the metabolism and coud help weight loss. Is that true?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I have Crohn&#039;s, which is similar to ulcerative colitis. Based on the amount of EPA/DHA in the fish oil capsules I&#039;m taking (1000 mg fish oil containing 400 mg EPA and 200 mg DHA per capsule), could you give a recommendation for an appropriate dosage of these capsules for Crohn&#039;s? I&#039;m currently taking 5 a day.

		<description><![CDATA[Caleb, 1 cup of ground flax has about 600 calories; about 75% of those calories are from fat. That gives about 450 calories of oil.

		<description><![CDATA[Caleb, I don&#039;t have UC (although a friend does), but I&#039;m vegan and eat ground flaxseed every day for its fiber and omega 3s. 

My bag says that a serving size is 3 Tablespoons, so I generally grind 2-3 Tablespoons of flaxseeds every morning and mix them with my cereal.

For those of you who have never used ground flaxseeds, just buy a bag of whole flaxseeds and grind them as you need them in a coffeegrinder. Whole flaxseeds do not need to be refrigerated, but ground flaxseed does. (Which is why I only grind what I&#039;m going to eat that morning.)

		<description><![CDATA[Two tablespoons equals 30 millilitres, so if flax oil were the same density as water, that&#039;d be 30 grams, or 30,000 milligrams. Since oil&#039;s lighter than water, say 20,000 - 25,000. That means about 11,000 to 14,000 mg of omega-3.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Dennis. In authoritative discussions of what causes gingivitis, you won&#039;t find any mention of over-reactive immune system, just as it isn&#039;t mentioned in what you quote. Here&#039;s an example from the National Library of Medicine:

&quot;Gingivitis is due to the long-term effects of plaque deposits. Plaque is a sticky material made of bacteria, mucus, and food debris that develops on the exposed parts of the teeth. It is a major cause of tooth decay. If you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. Bacteria and the toxins they produce cause the gums to become infected, swollen, and tender.&quot;

http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001056.htm#Causes,%20incidence,%20and%20risk%20factors

Nothing in that description would lead one to suspect that enough flaxseed oil would eliminate gingivitis. But it does.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; To begin to understand the cause of this disease, you must know that ulcerative colitis is found only in parts of the world where people follow the Western diet, high in meat and dairy foods.  This is an autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks the body (in this case, the bowel primarily).

The course of ulcerative colitis is characterized by frequent exacerbations (relapses).  Previous studies have found a high intake of dairy products, and a low intake of dietary fiber, are associated with relapses.  Patients with ulcerative colitis also have higher concentrations of sulfur in their intestines and the course of the disease correlates with that amount.2  Sulfur appears to be toxic to the intestine.  So, where does all this sulfur come from?

The amount of sulfur in the intestine is increased by consuming animal products, which are inherently high in sulfur-containing amino acids, like methionine and cysteine.&quot; http://www.nealhendrickson.com/mcdougall/2004nl/041100pufavorite5.htm]]></description>
