		<description><![CDATA[Correction 
The ( fact ) about the orientals living healthy and long lives was thought by the western world to be because of the consumption of normal soy beans. Apparently that is wrong, and is actually due to fermented Soy, as in sauces and Natto.
The fermenting makes certain chemical changes which makes it a very different food source.
I put falsehood instead of fact....sorry...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The difference between fermented and unfermented Soy beans can be found on Dr Mercolas website. he is a Doctor but well into the healthy side of life.
The falsehood about the orientals living healthy and long lives was thought by the western world to be because of the consumption of normal soy beans. Apparently that is wrong, and is actually due to fermented Soy, as in sauces and Natto.
The fermenting makes certain chemical changes which makes it a very different food source.
Having soy sauce every day can help balance the hormones and helps ladies with hormone flushes. 
I cannot say whether the risk of hormonal cancer would still be there..Dr Mercola may have something to say about that. It is a long time since I looked at the subject.
I thought, since the fermented soy balances, rather than escalates, then that particular danger would be gone.
Certainly I feel very unwell on the Western world&#039;s soy powders and drinks, but I don&#039;t on Soy sauces.
I haven&#039;t tried Natto as I can&#039;t find a source in my country so far.
Apparently ALL fermented Soy products are safe, unless of course someone has decided to add something horrific to it !!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Skin cancers and melanomas are the curse of God against white people for their skin sins and continued evil of today. In Daniel, Isaiah and Revelations God warns He will curse the evil with the Sores That Do Not Heal. Skin cancer and melanomas are these sores.

Based on their skin color, whites exalted themselves above everyone else on the planet and called everyone else: ugly, evil and inferior.

Now, that giving everyone else life burns whitesâ€™ skin.

That giving everyone else life is God. The sun is God. The sun hates white people. God Hates White people.

God has fixed His holy light to discriminate between black and whites so that it burns the whites.

Ultraviolet light is the fire of the 2nd Rapture burning evil from the earth.]]></description>

C&#039;mon.  Already.  This is snake-oil.  

I fear that the soy bandwagon is just another false information cascade.  It is not often mentioned that the soy phyto-estrogens &lt;b&gt;may&lt;/b&gt; encourage cancer cells to grow in women have had breast cancer.  Somewhere I saw a reference to a linkage between soy and reduced sexual drive in rats as well as endometrial hyperplasia (abnormal vaginal bleeding).
