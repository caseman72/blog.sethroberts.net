		<description><![CDATA[FYI, a response from the OHRP is here:

They seem to be saying that as long as you&#039;re not *researching* whether checklists actually WORK, it&#039;s okay to just go ahead and USE them.  Which seems a bit weird, but oh well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m stunned at David Hunter&#039;s comment that elevates an administrative procedure to the same level as &quot;medical research&quot;.  This is the same type of medieval madness that objected to doctors washing their hands and cleaning up the bloody surgeons gowns.

Who will protect us from the &quot;ethics&quot; protectors!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth I don&#039;t see the problem here.

Why did John Hopkins not simply apply for approval before they began what was clearly research?

You seem to be siding with Hopkins because it worked, but what if it hadn&#039;t? What if their experiments had negative effects, would you then be condemning them? The job of research ethics committees is to ensure research is carried out ethically, and I don&#039;t see how bypassing them is laudable.]]></description>
