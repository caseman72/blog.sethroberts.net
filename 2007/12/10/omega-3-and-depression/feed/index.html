		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth, if you don&#039;t mind I could use some of your advice here. For the past few months I&#039;ve been steadily going into a mild depression, and the pattern fits your findings on seeing faces in the morning almost perfectly - I&#039;m generally in a very bad mood during the day, which causes me to sleep in until afternoon when my mood begins to go up. Finally night time comes and I&#039;m either at a party, which causes me to sleep in late, or at home going through insomnia and unable to sleep. Either way I go to bed late and the next day the cycle continues. Fortunately I&#039;m about to start my internship, which will allow me plenty of interaction with my co-workers in the morning and which will force me to go to bed at a decent hour, thus fixing most of the factors that cause the depression. 

 However, my problem is thus - I appear to be addicted to clubbing. Again, your theory would support this fact for if clubbing is my main way of getting social interaction then I would grow to be quite dependent on it. But at least at the moment I am slightly hesitant to cut off all of my clubbing entirely, as being a student this is quite a big part of my social life. (doubly so for being an extremely social person that I am). 

My first thought was to compromise and only go clubbing until say 11-12 at night, but your article says that the amish go to bed even earlier than that (9pm), which is a bit impractical for me. What would you recommend here? Would it be better to have a small amount of clubbing nights that end quite late, or a more frequent amount of clubbing that ends early?  Or should I cut out clubbing entirely?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Or eat a lot of fish. Yeah, good point. Someone should measure their omega-3 levels. The Amish don&#039;t have unusually low rates of bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder might be more sensitive to omega-3 than unipolar depression. There is a large cross-national negative correlation between rate of bipolar disorder and fish consumption, if I remember correctly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You point out that the Pennsylvania Amish have a one-year rate of unipolar depression of about 0.1 percent (page 238 of your paper).

I guess it&#039;s a pretty safe bet the Amish don&#039;t consume large amounts of either fish or flaxseed oil.]]></description>
