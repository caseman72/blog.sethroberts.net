		<description><![CDATA[I think Seth&#039;s general point that we should be alert to new hypotheses is well taken; and in many domains new hypotheses can be readily tested through self experimentation -- if we could have 1000 skilled self experimenters working together around the world, to judge from Seth&#039;s achievements, we could do a lot of good.

Regarding &quot;placebo&quot;: It&#039;s a concept that hides more than it reveals. It could reflect a dissonance effect resulting from intolerance of psychological contradiction. It&#039;s well known that if you can get people to choose to participate in a second experiment, after going through one already, that causes them to suffer more electric shocks or eat more salty foods that require enduring thirst, their act of choosing causes them not only to say that they are less stressed by the shocks or thirst the second time around, but physiological measures confirm this. 

And people in nursing homes live longer if they are given more choice over their environments. It may be that Sarah&#039;s own initiative and choice resulted in symptom reduction, which is real, but caused not by the agent she consumed but by her own positive attitude and belief.

And we have to allow for reporting effects where someone says there pain is reduced and wants it to be when it isn&#039;t; I&#039;ve done this. When I pay good money for something, it&#039;s hard to admit it&#039;s not working.

Second, when is &quot;placebo&quot; just return to the mean? If people seek help when their suffering is bad and will get better on it&#039;s own, a placebo effect may just be an effect of time and not an effect of &quot;belief&quot; or &quot;expectation&quot;. 

As I recall, a meta-analysis of placebo effects done a few years ago found zero effects for blood pressure and cholesterol; and very small ones for pain. 

&quot;Placebo&quot; is a concept that reflects a lack of precision and rigor in those who use it....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Why didnâ€™t the conventional treatments benefit from the placebo effect?

Maybe because the alternative treatments offer something conventionals donÂ´t: a sense of power, not a passive acceptance. People like to read about &quot;natural&quot; treatments in popular magazines that are written for the lay person (they gat an exlpnanation of the suffering) and they let one take charge of their problem and do something active appart from obeying a doctor.]]></description>
