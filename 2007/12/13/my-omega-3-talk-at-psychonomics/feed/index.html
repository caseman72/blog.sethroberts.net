		<description><![CDATA[For one thing, I dispute your ability to notice a decline in gum health with excessive amounts of fat intake (or a plateau, or lowest effective dose--these things require more subjects.  shocker.)  Without this, you&#039;re stuck saying &quot;brains need this much, but any amount is good for gums.&quot;  

2-3 tablespoons of oil seems like a large amount even for early coastal humans, let alone those on the savanna.  It seems a stretch to claim an optimum.

In fact, browsing your presentation, I notice you didn&#039;t even find the optimum for the brain, only a plateau in effect.  An easy (and easily confirmed) explanation for this is that storage has maxed, but there are others just as relevant as your conclusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[NEI, I don&#039;t follow your reasoning. If you have a different explanation of why a dose of flaxseed oil chosen based on brain measurements did such a good job of improving gum health, I&#039;d like to hear it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is really sketchy reasoning.

Your appliances were designed for 2 things: to be useful, and fit your 120V line.  Evolution happens at the edge of life or death, and my first inclination would be to say that only one of the advantages: anti-inflammation or better reaction time etc, is necessary at any one cusp.  The probability of needing optimums of both is (to first order) unlikely.

In any case, without more specific examples (specific proteins and vitamins from the past, and studies showing the optimal coupling of the involved systems) I wouldn&#039;t have made the strong statement about &quot;should&quot;.  Could, might?  Maybe.]]></description>
