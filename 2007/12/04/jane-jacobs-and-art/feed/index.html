		<description><![CDATA[No, I&#039;m just saying that blogging is a say of publishing.  Writing is the creative activity, blogging is the medium.

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. Maybe you are thinking that painting and writing are &quot;large&quot; while blogging is &quot;small&quot;. What I was thinking is that painting and blogging are activities that inherently involve a lot of emotion. Writing may or may not. Do newspaper writers care a lot about their assigned topics?

I think so, unless it&#039;s a job.]]></description>
