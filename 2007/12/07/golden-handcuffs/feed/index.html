		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;ve seen this throughout my career.  What is strange is that everyone knows these stories in business, and yet they still seem to think they are not the stupid ones. 

The problem is getting worse, as Paul Graham&#039;s essay showed and which you pointed to in an earlier post.  The cost of startups, at least software startups, is now almost zero, so they are proliferating.  The majority will lack any social proof, so it takes a different skill plus luck to differentiate the wheat from the chaff.  Graham argues that those, like Google, who have sat the other side of the table and been ignored by large corporates and investors, will be better equipped to function in this more uncertain ecology, where the acquisition of the right collections of talent and technology will determine success.  But the tendency in business will be to cluster around what is known, like Hollywood does with stars, who then grab a disproportionate share of the cashflows, while not necessarily delivering success.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The bit about the helicopter made me laugh. I worked in marketing for DEC for a few months in the late 80s. The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of all our sales strategies was always just that: fly &#039;em to DEC headquarters in the company helicopter, they&#039;ll be putty in our hands!]]></description>
