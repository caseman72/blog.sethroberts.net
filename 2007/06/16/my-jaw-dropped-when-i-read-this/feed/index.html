		<description><![CDATA[You do know this is a hatchet job, right?

From the very first sentence, this reveiw is loaded down with trigger words meant to paint Justice Thomas in a very bad light.  No doubt the book does too, but really, the very part you quote would suggest the improbable nature of the author&#039;s point of view.  It&#039;s his family!  Obviously he loves his family!

Plus, the right to free association, to name just one off the top of my head, would mean anti-miscegenation laws would be unconstitutional to anyone with his political views.  Seriously, this is a BAD hatchet job!  Can you really imagine somebody being as conflicted as the review suggests and being able to function at all, let alone sitting on the Supreme Court?]]></description>
