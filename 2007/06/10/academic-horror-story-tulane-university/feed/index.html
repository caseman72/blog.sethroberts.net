		<description><![CDATA[Hey,

I know someone with a similar case. He received a 2 year suspension for using material from a website on a 4 page paper in his last semester before graduation. I am interested to know if you know what happened to the person you wrote about (if he was able to finish college, get a job, etc). Thanks and have a good one!]]></description>
