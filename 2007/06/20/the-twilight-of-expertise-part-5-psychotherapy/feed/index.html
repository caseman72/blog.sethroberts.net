		<description><![CDATA[Someone had trouble posting this:

Bill Wilson, the founder of AA, is an excellent example of someone who made a great discovery through self-experimentation. The AA program was adapted from an earlier program based on Wilson&#039;s observations about what worked and what didn&#039;t work for alcoholics. The entire program continued to be shaped by this type of experimentation and by group collaboration. AA is far from perfect, but evidence-based medicine has so far failed to come up with a treatment option that rivals the 12 step approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re right. 

Unfortunately if you go to a cafe for breakfast you are unlikely to have long conversations with the other patrons. Which is why I like the OneTaste breakfast. The mother of a friend of mine suffered from severe depression; she couldn&#039;t get out of bed. She got better when she started a business breakfast for women. Maybe other sorts of breakfast groups are possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I repost, it seems I have some problems.

Very nice post. Now I think I have a reason why so many people like to have breakfast at a cafe (a habit I hate). It canÂ´t be they are too lazuy to make a cup of coffee.]]></description>
