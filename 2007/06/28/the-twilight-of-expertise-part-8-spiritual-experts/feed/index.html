		<description><![CDATA[If this Tibetan practice is widely followed, wouldn&#039;t it qualify as a folk practice rather than expert-driven practice?  

An example of twilight of expertise in religion is the rise of clergy-less places of worship.  I&#039;m most familiar with Jewish case:  the chavurah (a type of clergyless prayer group) movement is a few decades old, and recently the most dynamic parts of Judaism are arising from non-denominational independent traditional prayer groups which have sprung up starting with Hadar in Manhattan, and subsequently in most urban centers.  Of course, many of these groups were started by skilled lay leaders who attended a couple of Ivy League colleges, so maybe it is just a different type of expertise.  

Someone who has a finger on the pulse of Christian movements can comment on that.  My sense is that the rise of non-denominational evangelical Christianity has brought greater opportunities for substantial lay leadership.  The few street ministries that I know of were started by people who don&#039;t have any particular credential except experience in witnessing, and they perpetuate it by training lay people.]]></description>
