		<description><![CDATA[The bit on the front of the book that says &quot;Baik untuk Diabetes &amp; Kolesterol&quot; is roughly translated as &quot;Good for those with diabetes and (high) cholesterol&#039;. 
&quot;Tanpa&quot; does indeed mean &quot;without&quot;, you&#039;re spot on on that (doesn&#039;t guessing right make you feel smart? It always does for me). &quot;Tanpa lapar, tanpa pantangan, tanpa olahraga&quot; therefor means &#039;Without hunger, without restrictions, without sports&quot;. 

Sadly, if I had seen this Indonesian version of the book in a store, I would&#039;ve laughed my ass off and passed it off as a fad diet that&#039;ll crash and burn within a month. The Indonesian cover seriously sounds that bad... (Luckily, I heard about this diet through different channels. I haven&#039;t tried it yet as my book hasn&#039;t arrived yet at the store, but once it&#039;s there, I&#039;m going for it. Wish me luck!)]]></description>
