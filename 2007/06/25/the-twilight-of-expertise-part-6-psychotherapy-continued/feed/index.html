		<description><![CDATA[Yes, so very true.  As a practicing therapist and director of an organization dedicated to promoting healthy psychotherapy and counseling, I can tell you that the inability of some therapists to self-examine is a big issue.  As a general rule of thumb I believe that if the therapy is not going well, then there is a part in the way.  The part may be an aspect of the client, but it is just as likely to be an aspect of the therapist.  A good therapist makes an effort to know themselves and to be conscious of how parts of themselves may be interfering with the clients work or reacting to the client in subtle and significant ways.  It&#039;s an excellent subject to talk about and one that we at goodtherapy.org are trying to being more awareness to.  Thanks for the blog post... I look forward to reading more and exploring your blog.
