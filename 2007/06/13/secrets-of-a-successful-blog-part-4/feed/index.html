Being regular and frequent doesn&#039;t work out for me.  I have to find a good article and the passion to write about it.  I need to have that spark of fire that drives me to write and I don&#039;t have that everyday.  I have blogs inside me waiting to come out but I just don&#039;t have the fire to write them aggressively.  I am going to try to write more frequently.  That should be my goal.]]></description>
