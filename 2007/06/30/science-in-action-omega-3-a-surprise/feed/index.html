		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m afraid i wasn&#039;t clear.  you can buy flax seed oil that contains high lignan in the oil, so you don&#039;t have to eat the flax seeds separately.  You have to check the label for &quot;high lignans&quot;  (if you do decide to eat flax seeds separately they must be ground up to release, among other things, lignans.  If you eat flax seeds whole -without grinding- it will likely just pass thru you system.  you can use a coffee grinder to grind the seeds.  i purchase a Krup, which is effective and wasn&#039;t too much $$$)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yeah, the author of the article noted that the potential increase risk stemmed from most flaxseed oil&#039;s lack of lignans.

eating actual seeds sounds like its more difficult to deal with than oil.  and I bet that oil enters one&#039;s system more effectively than eating seeds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if flaxseed oil increases the risk of prostate cancer. An excellent just-published article (that I will describe in an upcoming post) implies that omega-3 fats decrease the risk of colorectal cancer -- and therefore presumably all cancers.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks. I think you could increase your intake of antioxidants like vitamin E, selenium, etc. I read (PeltonÂ´s book) that high Omega 3 intake requires adecuate antioxidants.

On the subject of fatty acids and creativity, have you read this article (I donÂ´t remember where I found it mentioned that caused me to download it, maybe here)?:

Psychoses and creativity:is the missing link a biological mechanism
related to phospholipids turnover?
Bradley S.Folley*,Mikisha .Doop,Sohee Park
Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University, 301 Wilson Hall, 111 21st Ave. South, Nashville, TN 37240, USA

Horrobin has suggested [3 ]that evolutionary brain
changes occurring 2 million years ago coincided with the
appearance of both psychoses and creativity,and that
creativity and psychoses-proneness have made us truly
human.Elements of both psychotic thoughts and
creative thinking occur in all humans at some time;
indeed there is a continuum attributable to both of these
states suggesting that all humans are capable of
psychotic thinking and creative problem-solving.If
these elements can be ***related to changes in dietary fat
intake***,then it is also possible to assume that alterations
in catecholamine neurotransmitter function mechanisms
may have evolved as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently read in an article that drinking flaxseed oil increases one&#039;s risk of prostate cancer. The article states that the risk can be avoided by eating actual flaxseeds.

Does the risk of prostate cancer have a strong scientific basis?  and are there any disadvantages of eating flaxseeds as opposed to drinking flaxseed oil?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[4 tablespoons / day is a high dose. Do you take extra antioxidants?.

From which dose do you start to notice balance improvement?. I need to have a reference to give flax oil to an old person with balance problems. I will post results if I can convince this person to take it.

Thanks.]]></description>
