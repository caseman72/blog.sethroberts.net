		<description><![CDATA[Wow, thanks for the compliment on my writing.  And thanks above all, for my new healthier and svelter self.  I can&#039;t believe how easy it has been to eat reasonable portion sizes and cut down on junky snacks.  I&#039;m so happy with my new relationship with food, and as an added bonus, I find that sipping a cup of sugar water is a great way to relax.  I tell any and all who will listen about the good times I&#039;m having in Shangri-La!]]></description>
