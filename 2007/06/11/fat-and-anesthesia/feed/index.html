		<description><![CDATA[are you suggesting that olive oil, which is touted as a heart healthy oil, makes the cells in general and brain cells in particular, less responsive?  are you saying that taking olive oil will reduce one&#039;s ability to maintain balance and compute mathematical problem (with the inference that such a reduced ability reduces one&#039;s mental ability)?]]></description>
