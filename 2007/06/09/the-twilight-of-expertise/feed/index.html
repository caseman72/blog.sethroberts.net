		<description><![CDATA[I would note that self-experimentation is a bit more difficult when trying to make infrastructrue changes on a broad level - transforming the energy economy is one example I know that Stewart Brand has also been addressing. But then there&#039;s another problem when dealing with these sorts of things: what is an &quot;expert&quot; ?  Is it a researcher who has never tried to implement solutions on a broad scale?  An engineer who has - but is likely servng as an official spokesman for his/her particular business concern?  A longtime activist who has done some research?     Just some food for thought.]]></description>
