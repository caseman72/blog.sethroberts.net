		<description><![CDATA[I have found taking omega 3 fish oil supplements more effective when taken with salty food than when taken with unsalted food.

If I take fish oil with a salty meal, the improvement in my concentration, articulacy and mood is noticeably larger than when I take fish oil with a zero salt breakfast of muesli and full fat milk.

I have noticed this effect many times. Anyone else?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[seth,
Ar you looking at the ratio between omega-3 and omega-6?  Since omega -6 helps the blood clot and is part of the imflammatory process (CHD), I am interested in the ratio.  Do you test both?  What methodology do you use?
have you heard of Mondello or Michael Pollan?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[how many g&#039;s of omega-3 would you recommend taking per day?  do you think it matters what form it comes in (flaxseed oil, fish oil supplements, real fish, etc.)?]]></description>
