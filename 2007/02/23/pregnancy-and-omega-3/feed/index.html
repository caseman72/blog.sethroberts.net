		<description><![CDATA[I just read a book that fish oil / omega 3 oils have a positive effect on the brain and behavior if taken in the right doses. The doctor actually cured some depression and anxiety problems in patients with just high doses of high quality omega 3&#039;s and fish oil supplements. If it works in them why wouldn&#039;t it work in children??

		<description><![CDATA[I guess in  every intake of food, be it fish or supplement, there ought to be an balance, in moderation with gynae&#039;s advice. There are many different kind of fishes and certain are definitely have to to be avoided like swordfish...
I guess fried fish isn&#039;t healthy to eat as well, since fried stuffs are supposed to be one of the unhealthier range of food for consumption..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fish oils definately is good for mother and child.However,moderate intake should be practised as too much of DHA has been proven to actually imbalance the immune system for the infant.

Once again,the intelligence of a child do depend on how well the brain is stimulated and not soplely on DHA]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a vegetarian and as such do not eat meat.  Not because I have any morals to uphold, but simply because I don&#039;t like the taste.  Anyway, this leaves me somewhat limited in terms of food to eat.  Fortunately I love fish, so when I was pregnant that was pretty much all I ate.

Needless to say my son is a child genius.  Well not quite, but he has above average intelligence for his age; coincidence?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it the Omega-3 or the fish?  I think the DHA.  I took DHA throughout my pregnancy because of studies I had read about in the book Tomorrow&#039;s Baby - that taking DHA during pregnancy produces larger brain size and smarter children.  Now this fish study comes out...wonder who sponsored it!  Why not take Neuromins, an algae-form of DHA, and avoid the mercury risk?  

This from Wikipedia - 
A study[6] found that preterm infants fed baby formulas fortified with DHA derived directly from algae gained weight faster than infants fed formula fortified with DHA from fish oil. Additionally, there are no risks of harmful contaminants such as methyl mercury or dioxins, which are present in fish and fish oils.[citation needed] This is especially important for pregnant and nursing women and young children.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good point, although I&#039;m pretty sure it would have been impossible -- too much work. They did control for &quot;maternal highest educational attainment.&quot; In one analysis they controlled for paternal seafood consumption and the maternal effect was still present.]]></description>
