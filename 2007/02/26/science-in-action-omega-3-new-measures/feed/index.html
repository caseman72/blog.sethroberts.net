		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s something that might make chess measurable:

http://chess.emrald.net/Welcome.php

Chess tactics problems. Each one is rated based on its difficulty (according to how hard it was for other chess problem solvers). Each has one right answer, and times how fast you get the answer right. I&#039;m not sure how easy it would be to grab the data off of their pages to put into your analysis, but worth looking into, maybe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good suggestion about trying harder problems. I may eventually do that. With harder problems, it is more difficult to stay at the same place on one&#039;s speed/accuracy tradeoff function. But that doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t worth a try.

When I analyze my data I do subtract the linear drift. I will post examples.

That&#039;s good news about my diet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems likely that you will improve through practice in any activity that you choose. You can, as you have previously remarked, reduce the effect of this drift by alternating your omega-3 in time. You could also subtract out the linear term in your fit to the data, and compare only the intercepts. (Assuming of course that you fit on contigous data during which the dosage was constant - as you did in some earlier plots). 

If I were doing this, I would be tempted to try somewhat harder arithmetic problems. You remember what 5 + 8 equals, but you probably have to calculate (in your head) what 329 + 846 equals. I&#039;d imagine a different part of your brain comes into play. 

By the way, I&#039;ve been on your oil diet for about a month and have lost about
3% of my weight. So far so good!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Based on this blog, I upped my daily dose of Omega-3. Previously, I was taking 1 tablet per day of Costco (Kirkland_ brand fish oil Omega 3. These tablets contain 1000 mgs, with 180 mg being EPA, 120 being DHA, and the balance unspecified. 

After reading about Seth&#039;s experiment&#039;s, I started taking two pills per day. I noticed an immediate depression effect on my mood. After a few days of this, I took two days with no pills, and my depression lifted. I am now back on one pill and I seem to be fine. 

I do not take any anti-depressants or other medication.]]></description>
