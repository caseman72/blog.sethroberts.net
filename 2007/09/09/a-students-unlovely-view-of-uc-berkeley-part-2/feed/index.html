Many schools have classes that encourage students to do internships and volunteer work. They are often called &quot;fieldwork&quot; classes.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The student who spoke to me said that UC Berkeley did nothing to help her find out (a) what she was good at and (b) what she enjoyed.&quot;

I agree that these are important things for college students to find out, but does any college help students do this, and if so, how?  

Any advice that college students receive is complicated by the fact that they&#039;re trying to be fiercely independent, and it&#039;s hard to tell them very much that they&#039;ll listen to.]]></description>
