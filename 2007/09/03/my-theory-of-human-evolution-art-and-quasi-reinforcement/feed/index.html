		<description><![CDATA[Although your argument is appealing, I think you are ignoring the same nature of incremental development that happens in all of technology.  For example, the Internet has been one of the most impressive technical tools to recently happen.  To think that all of the parts of the Internet had to be in place and working for it to have value is wrong.  There was a constant pattern of developing useful small changes in the 25 years prior to the world &quot;discovering&quot; the Internet -- each a small refinement of previous results.  That pattern of small improvements is repeated over and over in the tool making world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[years ago i did bio-feed back training.  The object was to maintain a state of mind in a particular range of brain waves (i forget the precise type of brain wave).  When i maintained the desired state i got the equivalent of brownie points which were reflected on a screen and after i reached a sufficient number of points a grand finale occurred, such as a compute depiction of a volcano erupting or fireworks.  this reminds me of what you call &quot;quasi-reinforcement.&quot;  you also see it on message boards, where posters appear to compete for recognition and &quot;recommendations&quot; of their messages.  a broader inquiry would be the evolutionary purposes of what you call quasi-reinforcement and its derivatives, since it appears to manifest itself widely.]]></description>
