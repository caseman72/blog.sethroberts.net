		<description><![CDATA[I was a runner when I was younger and am now a big brisk walker; I&#039;ve never gotten the same &quot;high&quot; from walking that I once got from running.

A comment on showers: it is clear to me that taking hot showers, probably by increasing blood flow to the brain, causes more mental activity -- I will have  flurry of thought, association, memory in my consciousness when I take showers. Descartes liked to think with his head near stove; he claimed it activated brain activity. Anyway, showers may be a confound worth considering. My guess is that people tend to sing in the shower because the brain is activated there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, as I think I mentioned before, you might want at some point to try &quot;intervals&quot; of cold shower bursts.  Athletes use contrast bathing to speed recovery, and I&#039;m confident it has an effect on cognitive function.  Three intervals of 30 seconds each of warm vs cold was the recommendation of the physios at Bath University Sports Training Village, who look after some of our leading international competitors, including the England Rugby team, some of whom reportedly go in for more extreme exposure to cold.  

I&#039;ve been doing this consistently and almost daily since June/July and am satisfied of the benefits.  I believe mood, cognition and dealing with stress have all been better as a result.  There was one week when I could not cold shower and did not always feel so fresh. 

Some research has been done on the effects of cold on mental function and is mentioned here:-

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of anecdotal suggestions:

With me, I definitely feel sharper after exercise, but also not immediately after.  I may feel duller for a couple of hours, but much more alert and &quot;on top of it&quot; about six hours later.  This happens both on days where I do my &#039;sprint&#039; training (absolute max. effort for 30 seconds alternated with 3 minutes fast walking, repeated several times) or my resistance exercise (very heavy weights, slow cadence, one set to failure.)

Second, I agree with Willy that walking will give you little effect...it&#039;s not really exercise.  

Finally, the NY Times recently ran an article on recent research that exercise increases the formation of new brain cells, even in the elderly:
