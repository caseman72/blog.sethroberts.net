		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t be so concerned with an undergraduate commenting that his office is â€œlike a soap opera.â€ Such rhetoric is the stuff of small talk. When I was a consultant, I would often talk to past associates about the zoo that my current project is or relate the dramas going on in my old project.

Now that I am back in academia, I talk to my old friends about the &quot;soap opera&quot; that is my current department.

Maybe MIT can do a better job of preparing its graduates. However, I don&#039;t take such comments as an indication that they are not doing a good job of it now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another view from M.I.T.

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7603731854830368188&amp;q=fab+labs&amp;total=79&amp;start=0&amp;num=10&amp;so=0&amp;type=search&amp;plindex=0

Hopefully the link works.  Its a Ted Talk from Neil Gershenfeld.  He&#039;s started something called Fab Labs (fabrication).  Anyway, it&#039;s fascinating, and it proves demand driven education works.  I can&#039;t go into a full description here, but I think this is a great model for how things could work.  

He has a book out there by the same name too.]]></description>
