		<description><![CDATA[Gary Taubes&#039; diet recommendations sound similar to SLD and especially Dr. Atkins diet.

Did anyone really disprove Dr. Atkins?  I know there was a giant backlash against him with people distastefully making fun of how fat he was when he died.

Didn&#039;t Atkins start all of this? or at least popularized the idea that Seth and Gary Taubes seem to agree with: the type of food one eats, NOT THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES, matters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello, this is a very interesting and important finding.

I think I would choose running 10 minutes on the spot (better on a rubber mat). The problem is sweat. Not good for when you are at the office.

Instead of coffee machines there should be places to walk and exercise at work.

No wonder a school of philosophy is called &quot;peripatetic&quot;. The greek walked to think. Maybe for a different reason, it seems that when you put your body to work or in movement your mind is more free of tensions. But it could also be due to what you describe here.]]></description>
