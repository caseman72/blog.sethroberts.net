		<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth, a general finding about performance and the presence of others, which is believed to be an effect of arousal. We perform well-learned easy tasks, like simple arithmetic or tying our shoes better, faster, when in the presence of other people. The presence of others is arousing physiologically and that makes it easier.

We perform more novel, difficult tasks worse in the presence of other people; it is believed because we are more aroused. It was suspected that this was because we feared being judged by others, but it holds even if the others present cannot see us. 

Robert Zajonc is the one who theorized all of this, that is, made sense of the disparate findings about performing better or worse around other people.

I wonder if the arousal effects of exercise might differentiate in terms of easy versus difficult tasks.]]></description>
