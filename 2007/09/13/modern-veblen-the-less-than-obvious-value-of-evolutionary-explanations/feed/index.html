		<description><![CDATA[Interesting blog. It&#039;s a tricky business. &quot;Just so&quot; stories make good servants but bad masters. If the just so story gives us a hypothesis we can confirm or disconfirm then it can lead to breakthroughs, as in Seth&#039;s work on weight control or faces in the morning; if the story can&#039;t be falsified, then it&#039;s an appeal to intuitive plausibility and may or may not be true. But sometimes all we can do is generate hypotheses and hope that future evidence will emerge and confirm or disconfirm them. And sometimes we can theorize in a way that our theories will never be confirmed. The problem is treating hypotheses as truths -- or treating hypotheses about reality as accurate representations of reality without being honest about it, which is I suspect what Gould is complaining about. It is a form of intellectual corruption that&#039;s common.  

It&#039;s often noted that Freud is full of these just so stories that can&#039;t be confirmed; yet a charismatic therapist can foist them on patients and convince them they are true. One problem in therapy is knowing what&#039;s a valid insight; people can have what feels like insights that aren&#039;t, like insights that they were sexually abused as children and that explains their difficulties; or at the fringes, insights about past lives. 

It&#039;s also useful to distinguish theorizing not based on any methodically derived evidence from insight that is. Most scientific psychology tries to theorize based on scientific evidence. But in a lot of social theory and sociology, people will state that the world is like X, without showing it, and then theorize about why. I know because I&#039;ve done it, and it passed peer reviewers in sociology easily...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure you are disagreeing with Gould&#039;s actual point: just-so stories, those which assume that &quot;everything exists for a purpose&quot;, are taken &quot;too seriously&quot; in the actual literature. That doesn&#039;t mean that they shouldn&#039;t exist, or that evolutionary biologists should stop constructing them (especially in dinner conversations, or just with a glass of wine); it certainly doesn&#039;t conflict with your observation that something is better than nothing. I haven&#039;t found evolutionary biologists (my brothers and uncle) to be reluctant to come up with just-so stories; they just don&#039;t take the stories very seriously &lt;em&gt;until they turn into testable ideas.&lt;/em&gt; My ornithologist/environmentalist brother did, long ago, have an American Bird column on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Facts%2C+Inferences+and+Shameless+Speculations%22&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Facts, Inferences and Shameless Speculations&quot; &lt;/a&gt;; it&#039;s unfortunately the case that not all scientists are good at keeping track of the differences between these categories.

I&#039;m sure your orientation really is different from Gould&#039;s; it&#039;s likely that you would view an explicit list of shameless speculations as having higher value than he, and I might agree--I sometimes thought he was looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel_%28biology%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;spandrel&lt;/a&gt;-stories where others  might look for purpose-stories. Still,  as the list got longer and longer, I think you would want to put down the wine-glass and start looking down that list for something testable, i.e.  something definite enough so that it might be found to be wrong. I predict that you would find that some evolutionary psychology people would be with you, indeed might be ahead of you... and that others, in particular the ones Gould is fussing about, wouldn&#039;t. (But my predictions are mostly wrong.)]]></description>
