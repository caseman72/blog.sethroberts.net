		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;I still am puzzled given the fact that no one has bothered to try to duplicate Blanchardâ€™s findings.&lt;/i&gt;

This is incorrect. From the Netherlands (University Medical Center Utrecht and Gender Clinic at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam):

&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2005.01.008&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Transsexual subtypes: Clinical and theoretical significance&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Within a large transsexual sample (n = 187), homosexual and nonhomosexual subjects were compared on a number of characteristics before the start of treatment... &lt;b&gt;A distinction between subtypes of transsexuals on the basis of sexual orientation seems theoretically and clinically meaningful.&lt;/b&gt; The results support the notion that in the two groups different factors influence the decision to apply for sex reassignment.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I still am puzzled given the fact that no one has bothered to try to duplicate Blanchard&#039;s findings.  Every single study there is his own, absolutely no peer reviews and most of the studies seem to have been done at the same clinic except for a few exceptions.

If I were to conduct a study at an inner city clinic versus a suburban I think just about anything would show rather different results due to underlying population variance, yet he only has ONE clinic in his studies, and there is no control group.

There is also a near complete lack of study by him of FTM&#039;s.  At all three colleges I attended, they outnumbered the MTF&#039;s by 4-5times the number and there was far more than 1/56 of them that preferred men sexually.  So it doesn&#039;t seem to match my casual observation, hey if Bailey can do it so can I!]]></description>
