		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. I got a LG eNv, which has a full QWERTY keyboard, so I could type up ideas on the go and send myself cut and pastable notes. I&#039;ve done some composing on the run and come up with good ideas, but I need to work on my peripheral vision so I don&#039;t end up as a brilliant pancake.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find a lot of truth in the walking while having ideas. I think most people do. I have gone through several PDAs and always come back to the little paper notebook. 

There is another place where my brain works real fast and efficiently: Planes. Being stuck in a plane for 10 hours has consistently provided me a pretty good brainstorming session. I don&#039;t know if it is the surrounding, the air/atmospheric pressure, no internet, constant cooling or something else (like having to watch the seat in front of me something akin to your face studies). I have also noticed that ideas generated during those &quot;sessions&quot; generally are of different quality (more far reaching) than the ones I would have had on the ground. I wonder if I am the only one.
