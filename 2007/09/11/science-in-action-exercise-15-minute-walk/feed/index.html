		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Bob.

Why I did better across the board? My reaction times have been steadily going down for a long time. I&#039;m just learning the task better and better; how long the learning has continued (hundreds of tests) surprised me when I did the analysis that showed it.

This experiment was followed by another experiment in which I did see an RT decrease due to exercise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In this set your pre-walk reaction times are lower than in any other experiment. I&#039;m not surprised that you don&#039;t see an effect in this set because you&#039;re already responding faster than you do in other sets (even post-exercise). Any speculation on why you did better across the board on Saturday?

This is my first comment to your blog so I also want to take a moment and thank you for the consistently intriguing posts.]]></description>
