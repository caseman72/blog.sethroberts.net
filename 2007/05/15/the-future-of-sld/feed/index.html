		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s fairly well known that by holding one&#039;s nose, one can greatly reduce the perception of flavor in food, drink, etc. 

This effect is not just (total taste perception) - (intake of aroma from food). For instance, if one were to contrive an apparatus that doesn&#039;t stuff up one&#039;s nose, but instead allows one to breathe only filtered air through the nostrils, the reduction in perceived flavor would be minimal.

I&#039;m curious whether people who don&#039;t really mind holding their nose (or perhaps, using noseplugs) while consuming food or drink, might thus be able to satisfice on the shangri la diet under non-ideal circumstances (where even sugar water in a teacup is difficult to get)...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, actually spraying the perfumes on the food would be unwieldy and people are unlikely to do it while people are watching.  Wouldn&#039;t it make more sense to carry a set of short-life liquid aromas (food &quot;perfumes,&quot; if you will) that you could dab in each nostril before a meal?]]></description>
