		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Erica. &quot;A system that more often harms than helps&quot; -- I think you have put your finger on the problem. The less obvious effects turn out to be more damaging than the more obvious effects are beneficial.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Seth!
You are correct and your approach to helping people loose weight with natural, awareness enhancing methods works. I can attest to it and I am a conventional doctor who got fed up with a system that more often harms than helps.
