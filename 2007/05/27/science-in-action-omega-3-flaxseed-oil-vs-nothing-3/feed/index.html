		<description><![CDATA[By me, no. I prefer to do experiments where I am less sure of the answer. Most placebo-controlled experiments are, in my opinion, poor experiments. They are poor from both a pure-understanding and a practical point of view. From the pure-understanding point of view, they are bad because the manipulation is so crude: the conditions being compared differ in dozens of ways. From a practical point of view, they are bad because the knowledge they provide is almost useless: The interesting practical comparison -- the comparison that interests consumers -- is not between Treatment A and a placebo, it is between two plausible treatments. ]]></description>
