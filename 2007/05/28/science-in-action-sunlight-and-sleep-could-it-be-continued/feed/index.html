		<description><![CDATA[I sleep better, and feel better generally when I get a lot of fresh air; both when the air I&#039;m sleeping in is fresh and when my apartment during the day has fresh air. When you are outside you are getting both more sunlight and more fresh air; this is a confound that would have to be dealt with. 

Can you get more sunlight without getting more fresh air and see if you still get the effect?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am very grateful for the information concerning sleeping pills. This is completely new to me and a frightening revelation.  I have used eszopiclone sporadically for a few years, although I tried to be careful and usually took Â½ dose when I did use them.  And really, my sleep was never really improved with them.  Now they are dumped!  You seem to keep saving my life!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been informally experimenting with sunlight as a sleep aid for the past year, and I now have the suspicion that it helps me sleep better but unfortunately no hard data to share.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20060527/bob9.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Janet Raloff&#039;s wonderful two-part article on lighting&#039;s environmental and human impacts&lt;/a&gt; is what started me thinking about it last year. She cites some interesting research being done in this area.

I&#039;m glad you&#039;re taking a hard look at it now! I&#039;d be interested in participating in a group study if such a thing comes about.]]></description>
