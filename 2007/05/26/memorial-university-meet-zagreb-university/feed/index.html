		<description><![CDATA[Not exactly. It was the first example of a new section (&quot;Debate&quot;) and there were no other articles in that section, no replies to what I had written. However, in that issue an editorial from the editor said this:

The journal must engage actively in discussion about the big issues that affect the nutrition-related well-being of society. The journal must be an example of best practice in terms of defining, adopting and following standards of best practice.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
I&#039;m curious--your article on scientific fraud seems to be labeled by the journal as a &quot;Debate.&quot;  Were there accompanying articles or discussions by others?]]></description>
