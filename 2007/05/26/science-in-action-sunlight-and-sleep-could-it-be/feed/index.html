		<description><![CDATA[I have noticed that on days I lay out in the sun for a minimum of one hour, I sleep like a baby. Other days, I don&#039;t sleep well at all. Unfortunately, I live in an area where we get rough winters. I am going to try,however, to be out in the winter on sunny days to see if that still enhances my sleep. I wish I could bottle whatever it is that helps me sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You might recall the experiment done at Wake Forest where they had subjects who liked to sunbathe spend time in two areas of artificial sunlight; one of which had the ultraviolet light screened out. They were given mood assessments afterwards and alternated exposures in the different rooms. Mood was much higher after being exposed to the UV light; and when they were given a choice at the end of the experiment to pick one of the two rooms to sunbathe in, 11 of 12 preferred the one with UV light.

Here&#039;s one summary
http://isteve.blogspot.com/2006/04/tanning-and-mood.html
&quot;Professor Steven Feldman The Wake Forest team analysed 14 people, aged between 16 and 34, who typically used tanning beds two times a week. Each volunteer spent 15 minutes lying on a sunbed which exposed them to UV rays and then on another - again for 15 minutes - which released no rays. The volunteers were not told which beds released UV. The subjects were asked if they would like to return days later and use a sunbed of their own choosing. Twelve returned and 95% [?] opted for the bed which radiated UV light. They said it made them feel good and helped them relax. The researchers believe that tanning may release endorphins into the bloodstream.&quot;

So the better sleep could be mediated by better mood during the day. Maybe you should try being outside exposed to UV rays versus being in the shade outside... 

There&#039;s also the question whether sunlight is a conditioned stimulus; we react with positive emotion because we associate it with freedom as children (Rain rain go away), and warmth. I don&#039;t think in desert cultures people love sunny days... It may be that being out in &quot;beautiful&quot; sunny days lifts mood, which enhances sleep. So I&#039;d be curious to see if being outside on cloudy days has the same effect.

God science is complicated and hard -- but the knowledge can change your life. 
Cheers,
Tim]]></description>
