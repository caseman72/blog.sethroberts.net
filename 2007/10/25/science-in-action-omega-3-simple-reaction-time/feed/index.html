		<description><![CDATA[Hmm. Thanks for the explanation. When lots of previous results lead one to expect an effect in a certain direction, I&#039;m afraid I still don&#039;t see the problem with using a one-tailed test. But it hardly matters, since the effect was so strong. That&#039;s the nice thing about self-experimentation; you can usually do the experiment again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, what would you have done if your post-flaxseed-oil reaction times had clustered around 320ms?  Would you have concluded that this was logically impossible and clearly you&#039;d screwed up the experimental technique somehow?  Would you have thought it was logically impossible for this to actually represent the real effect of the oil?  Would you have thought it was uninteresting?  If I were in your place in that case, I would have thought that the result at least suggested that there was an effect in the opposite direction than I&#039;d originally thought, and perhaps warranted some more trials --- maybe at different times of day, for example --- rather than that the result was uninteresting.

If there&#039;s a possibility you might have reacted the same way and been induced to apply a two-tailed test &lt;i&gt;in extremis&lt;/i&gt;, rather than merely dismissing the apparent difference out-of-hand, then perhaps a two-tailed test is the right thing to apply in the first place?

That&#039;s where my creepy feeling comes from.  But I&#039;m pretty ignorant about statistics, so there could easily be a hole in my reasoning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think both of your suggested modifications are plausible but questionable.  I have creepy feelings about one-tailed tests (lots of actual statisticians have them too but they usually dress them up in fancier language) and you say in the post that it &quot;was hard to tell how long it lasted,&quot; so perhaps your choice of which points to reject may have been influenced by having seen the data values, especially the rather extreme outlier.

I&#039;m guessing that the data values on the chart represent averages over N reaction times in a session?  Maybe you could get more information about the distribution of your reaction times if you used the raw reaction times instead of per-session averages.  For example, it would be hard to plot the ones you have here on a Q-Q plot.  It might also give you more information that could be valuable for significance analysis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. do a one-tailed test. you did a two-tailed test. I predicted the direction of the effect.

2. omit the first and last &quot;after&quot; values (269 &amp; 295). I believed that the effect would take about an hour or more to develop and would wear off after 4 hours or so.

then you get t = 3.8, highly significant]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It is as if flaxseed oil lowers a threshold for action.&quot;

I noticed this phenomenon.  I think its a good thing.  Flaxseed oil appears to decrease my overall laziness.   

Is there any negative aspect of using Flaxseed oil instead of Canola oil for the SLD (using the plug your nose method)?  I don&#039;t think so. Maybe cost.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth: I always take about 2-2 and a half tablespoons of flax seed oil in the morning, around 8-8:30. The one very striking thing I&#039;ve noticed has to do with notetaking work. I take notes for 2 classes on Monday and Wednesday. I take notes from 10-11, come home and write up the notes from about 11:45-1:05 and return to take notes from 2-3; then come home again to write those up and finish the first batch, if I haven&#039;t already. What is striking is that I seem faster, more efficient, in taking and writing up the notes at 11:45 than I have ever been. There is a rapid flow from the notes onto the page as I write them that is faster than I have ever experienced -- and I have been doing this for 15 years. 

I suppose I could try not doing the flax seed oil in the morning and see if I am still so fast, but I really don&#039;t want to... In the afternoon, I always experience a drop in energy, but I may do some flax seed oil then to see if that affects my mental functioning. 

Subjectively, it seems to be an issue of mental energy. I hope somebody does standard double blind studies of this soon -- the broader community won&#039;t buy it until we have that...]]></description>

Are you really taking 4T of Flax seed oil? It seems a lot. I take about 1 T-2T (12 -24 oil capsules) a day. I wonder what the most optimal dose would be?]]></description>
