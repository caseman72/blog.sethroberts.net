		<description><![CDATA[While noise cancelling headphones would help you feel more at peace by reducing the variation in noise, wouldn&#039;t they still hurt your physical hearing since the overall decible level is actually higher?  I thought noise cancellation works by adding more noise so a 60 decible noise becomes unnoticable but you get that effect by adding 20dbs of cancelling noise.

I guess if the goal is to make the world quieter in the long term even when you&#039;re not wearning noise cancelling headsets, it&#039;s working :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I prefer my Etymotic isolation earbuds to the noise-cancelling headphones. Smaller, cheaper, and I think they sound better. Some people don&#039;t like things in their ears, however.

I wonder how much hearing gets damaged on airplanes. The small jets are really loud if you&#039;re sitting in the back. Fortunately at least some airlines are now letting people keep earbuds in (unplugged) during takeoff and landing, when it&#039;s loudest.]]></description>
