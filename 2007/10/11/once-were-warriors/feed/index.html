		<description><![CDATA[jeez. In oww both are Maori. Maori arrived around 1200 and they are the native people of New Zealand, there wasn&#039;t anyone there before them.

They had war rituals that are pretty similar to most small tribal groups anywhere in the world, old european tribes included.

The difference between the european blooded  New Zealander and the european blooded  Australian is the unique influence of the Maori race on the NZ culture ; and the slow realisation of its citizens, that white nzers are just late arriving &quot;islanders&quot; , the proud reject great great grandsons and daughters of a wave of &#039;low class&quot; european immigrants .   

NZ has the potential to be a great state]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, that&#039;s been my undrstanding too (though I&#039;m no closer to New Zealand than you are--well, actually, I live in Sunnyvale, so I guess I&#039;m a &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; closer...)

I think that&#039;s a big part of the subtext of OWW--that the abusive husband comes from native group which had been conquered and enslaved by the Maori, and he feels inferior to his Maori wife and overcompensates violently.]]></description>
