		<description><![CDATA[As John Tierney points out in his review of &quot;Good Calories, Bad Calories: Challenging the Conventional Wisdom on Diet, Weight Control, and Disease,&quot; by Gary Taubes, &quot;To bolster his [low fat] theory, Dr. Keys in 1953 compared diets and heart disease rates in the United States, Japan and four other countries. Sure enough, more fat correlated with more disease. But critics at the time noted that if Dr. Keys had analyzed all 22 countries for which data were available, he would not have found a correlation.&quot;

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/science/09tier.html

When it comes to longevity, the one variable that empirically makes the biggest difference in all animal studies is caloric intake: the lower (to a point), the better. So when people talk about low-fat, high-fiber &quot;Third World&quot; and vegetarian diets, the critical intervening variable may well be low caloric intake. Epidemiological studies involving countries like Japan and Korea should factor in the twenty-year span during the middle of the 20th century when caloric consumption fell drastically.

At any rate, the incidence of heart disease or cancer in any population is meaningless unless paired with actual life expectancy. In Japan, death from stroke over the past 50 years has fallen dramatically. Death from heart disease has climbed. Each generation of children has been bigger than their parents. Longevity has steadily increased, despite the fact that Japanese men still smoke like crazy. Studies have pointed to a strong inverse relationship between consumption of animal fat and stroke.

Everybody dies of something. What matters is when, and the quality of life up to that point.]]></description>

Deaths due to cerebrovascular disease was 43% lower in the vegetarians compared with the general population.
