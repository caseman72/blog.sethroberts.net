		<description><![CDATA[Well, I am the Mark Claffey interviewed in this article. My hearing isn&#039;t really damaged, I just have an abnormal sensitivity to loud and high pitched sounds. Drumming over 2 or 3 years without earplugs has caused a ringing in my right ear. I now wear ear plugs to prevent any further damage in my ears. Thankfully marching band is coming to an end, which means putting away the loud marching drums, and bringing out some of the quiter, (not really), drums. I plan to go into college for music, and plan to wear earplugs when I am practicing. Anyone interested in talking to me about hearing loss from marching band please e-mail me at mclaffey12489@yahoo.com.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had gained the impression that it was possible, sustaining years of exposure to noise, to develop a tolerance for noise levels.  After repeatedly being exposed to a certain level of sound at a certain frequency, the part of your ear that receives that sound gets damaged and needs a stronger volume.  It&#039;s why we lose our hearing and need people to shout at us as we get older, if I&#039;m not mistaken.

Using a personal example, I once determined I was building a tolerance to noise when I noticed that I kept turning my Walkman up higher and higher as an adolescent.  I needed to turn it up to maximum level 10 to get the same satisfaction I once got from level 5.

I&#039;ve known several musicians who could tolerate higher noise levels than I could; orchestral playing for a string section member has a far lower deicbel level because we aren&#039;t in close contact with the noisemakers, namely brass and percussion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pearl, years of playing don&#039;t toughen up your ears. It&#039;s not possible to condition yourself to withstand noise. If anything, that orchestral playing made your ears more susceptible, not less. 
Noise exposure causes damage that is cumulative, irreversible and untreatable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with this; there ought to be more awareness of what it does to kids hearing.

When I played in band in high school a few times as a bassist, I always tried to wear earplugs during rehearsal or performance because it actually felt physically painful, it was so loud.  My years of orchestral playing hadn&#039;t conditioned my ears to be used to it.  

I had no idea how they could tolerate it; some of the kids have the bells of the brass instruments pointed directly at their ears.]]></description>
