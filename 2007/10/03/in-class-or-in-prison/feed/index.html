		<description><![CDATA[As a student I have a couple suggestions for lecturers who wish to increase attentiveness in science classes.

1) Do not hand out copies of the notes. When I already know what a professor is going to cover it&#039;s easy to take a superficial glance at the material and convince myself that I already know what they&#039;re going to say. Also, a student who needs to record the material themselves won&#039;t have time to devote to other distractions.

2) Do not present from PowerPoint. Slides allow too much information to be thrown at a student at once and they won&#039;t know what to pay attention to. Figures are almost always too complex to reproduce in notes, and slides are too verbose. If it&#039;s not possible for the instructor to draw or write out a concept in the time alloted to it, the student won&#039;t be able to either.

3) Show partial derivations, including algebra. It&#039;s often obvious to an expert in the field what simplifying assumptions can be made for a problem, but when it&#039;s first introduced to a student these can be huge road blocks in their understanding. A lecture I can follow is much more interesting than one where I become lost.

4) Finally, take a hard line from the beginning. Confront students who have open laptops or other distractions as soon as they&#039;re noticed. Lectures should be attended voluntarily, if students don&#039;t want to pay attention they shouldn&#039;t be present.]]></description>
