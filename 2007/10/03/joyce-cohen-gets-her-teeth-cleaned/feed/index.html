		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing 3-4 tablespoons a day and my gums are better as well according to my dentist. Barlean&#039;s has the most palatable taste of the ones I&#039;ve tried. Also, if you put the oil in a small clean glass with some water, then bring the glass to your mouth, and open your mouth wide, and then stick your tongue way out, OUTSIDE of the bottom of the glass, and against the bottom, and then gulp it down, you get very little taste, because it bypasses your tongue and enters the back of your mouth. Then I gulp down some water and then take a big swig of green tea and hold it in my mouth to mask any taste. 

I don&#039;t want any taste, in part because I don&#039;t much care for the taste, but also because I always go tasteless in the morning anyway, and lately have been going tasteless all day, but that&#039;s another story...]]></description>
