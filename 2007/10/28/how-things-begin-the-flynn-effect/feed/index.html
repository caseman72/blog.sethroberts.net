		<description><![CDATA[[...] What is Flynn effect, and how it came to&#160;be?  Seth at his blog recounts the story (that he heard from James Flynn himself): In the 1980s, he started to write a book defending humane ideals. One question he wanted to answer was how to combat racism. He came across Arthur Jensenâ€™s work. Jensenâ€™s work was not easily dismissed. It was based on data. To properly answer Jensen, he believed, you needed data â€” a radical view for a philosophy professor. This was outside his area of training. He asked a professor of psychology for advice. The psychology professor was dismissive; his attitude was â€œwhat could you possibly contribute?â€ But Flynn did not see that psychology professors were substantially smarter than everyone else; the necessary skills should be within his reach, he thought.

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article, marmolillo, thanks for the link. The study it describes implies that the Flynn Effect is not true everywhere always -- but no one expected that. The interesting lesson to be drawn from the facts Flynn found is that IQ depends heavily on environment in mysterious ways. The study the Guardian article describes supports the same conclusion.]]></description>
