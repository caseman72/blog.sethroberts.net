		<description><![CDATA[great idea.  college students need to be more proactive in finding their career.

But it is understandable why young people feel less urgent in finding a career now in comparison to 30 years ago.  it has to do with the job market being more fluid and less receptive to college grads in their 20&#039;s.  

All of this ties into the growing inequality debate.  Businesses are finding it much easier to reward their more productive employees, which is likely to be baby boomers with mba&#039;s and years of experience.  businesses simply find it less financially rewarding to invest money into 25 year olds.

so college students have less incentive to quickly find a career more now then 30 years ago.  And this encourages college grads in their 20&#039;s to experiment more in different job fields.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth!   This is why there was no point to us doing things stealth... because if you we have a good idea, chances are, there are some smart people who are thinking about it at the exact same time... .and... here you are!  Someone just left a comment about what you&#039;re up to on our blog... http:://blog.path101.com.   We&#039;re building a company around exactly what you&#039;ve come to... that students, and really many other people, simply don&#039;t know what&#039;s out there to be done.

Would love to chat sometime and see if there&#039;s a way to work together.]]></description>
