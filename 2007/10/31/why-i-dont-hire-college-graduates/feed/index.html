		<description><![CDATA[In response to the final line of this blog entry: &quot;If most people must spend four years in a place (college) where those in charge (professors) value only a small fraction of their abilities, a lot is lost.&quot;

It just strikes me odd that the writer thinks that professors are in charge.  If I had believed that, college would have been hideous.  As it was, I thought the whole thing was fun.  Especially amusing:  assignments.  You can learn without being obedient.

		<description><![CDATA[A B.A. in the 1920s would be equivalent to an advanced degree today - at least in terms of status. I&#039;m sure you can imagine someone preferring to hire B.A.s/B.Sc.s rather than grad students. They may or may not be brighter than the grad student, but they&#039;ve opted to join the workforce earlier rather than later, which may suggest something about their character.

A fair number of very bright, original thinkers don&#039;t have university degrees: think Robert Fulford and, oh yes, Jane Jacobs. That&#039;s going back a bit, mind you. I wonder if, nowadays, Jacobs could make a career with just a highschool diploma. Maybe: she worked her way up as a freelance journalist, and in journalism, as in sales, you&#039;re judged on what you produce, not on what your credentials say you ought to be able to produce. (J-schools have corrupted high-end journalism to some degree, especially in your country, I&#039;m afraid.)

&quot;Fortunately my high school marks had been so bad that Barnard [College] decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is really quite interesting; actually I think it was this type of mindset that caused a number of my family members to be quite opposed to me spending money on a college education, particularly one in music.  Whereas most of my peers in the music school couldn&#039;t fathom their parents not having supported them the entire way through their musical upbringing.  

My family is mostly comprised of self-made men who never got college educations; a local politician, a self-taught plumber, and a military senior-master sergeant.  It sounded absurd to them for me to invest in a college career, which would have caused me to go against everything I had learned in high school about having a career.

It is curious to me why a college degree is so important now as opposed to then.  I couldn&#039;t have gotten this cushy English teaching job if I hadn&#039;t had one because what are you if you haven&#039;t got a paper to prove you&#039;re something?

Of course the tragic thing is that classical music has gone so downhill in America, that most of my generation are chasing a hell of a lot of pipe dreams.  The only way to get a job now is to be willing to move anywhere in the world, preferably Europe where musicians are government-paid and receive great benefits.]]></description>
