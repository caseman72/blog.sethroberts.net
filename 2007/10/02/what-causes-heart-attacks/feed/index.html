		<description><![CDATA[Yes, and the omega 5 oil [ pomegrnate seed il ] has been researched in the context of prostate cancer.  You ought to review the reserach in the areas of antioxidants, ani inflammaiton, prostate cancer, and breast cancer to name a few.

The other day, I was told that Omega 5 could be helpful in minor cases of skin cancer.

Have you had any experience with pomegranate seed oil? 

The ladies are excited because it is a natural SPF and helps as an anti-aging / cellulite agent, I do not think that fish oil can do that, but again, I am not a scientist or physician.

You may want to look into Omega -5 oil.  I am taking a daily dose of Omega 5, it is boosting my system and my skin looks younger.

		<description><![CDATA[That was it; thanks.  But I&#039;ll keep my testosterone, and pass on the breast tissue.

BTW, prostate cancer is one of the slowest-developing cancers there is; many elderly men have it (undiagnosed) for years before dying of other causes.  

The ones who have it treated (prostates removed) will often have worse outcomes (impotence, incontinence.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing 2T deflavorized coconut oil during the day, and 2T flax (non-lignans, holding my nose) at night.

Seth, do you now prefer the version with lignans?  Seems to me there was some issue with the lignans...something estrogenic about them, perhaps? I might be confusing that with soy...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I guess it might be beneficial for those on the SLD to switch to flaxseed oil and plug their nose.

I currently take both canola oil (for the SLD) and flaxseed oil (for general health purposes).

Because Canola oil has a poor ratio between omega 3 and 6, could it be diminishing the results from my flaxseed intake?

Flaxseed oil appears to hit 2 birds with one stone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth -- how can the antioxidants rich Omega- 5 oil help in this situation?  would you recommend that we consume pomegranate seed oil to boost the system and protect the body against heart attacks.  These is some research out there that shows that Omega - oil has interesting cardio elements, I&#039;d suggest you check it out.

The Omega- 5 oil is sold in gel caps as well as in bottles.  From my expereicne, people prefer the soft gel caps.
