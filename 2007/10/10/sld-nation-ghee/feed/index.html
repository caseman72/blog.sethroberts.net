		<description><![CDATA[I understand that flaxseed oil is the next best thing to having a multi-vitamin a day.  The reasoning for actually ingesting this oil in it&#039;s purest form per day:  Is this a viable way to consume this because it absorbs into the system faster than if it were in pill form?  Assuming the answer is yes, would it be a good idea that instead of holding my nose before taking it in, would I be able to mix it with something like Kool-Aid or Gatorade mix?  If the answer to that is yes, would it be even a better idea to mix it with something creamy like chocolate or strawberry milk mix and milk?  Thank you in advance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I am curious, since you state you drink four tablespoons of flaxseed oil per day now, how do you get over the taste? I&#039;ve been taking two tablespoons a day for a month now, and the aftertaste is just awful. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wonder what the omega-3 content of milk and then ghee is, especially from a Maltese cow.  I couldn&#039;t get the original study but this mentions that organic milk has more of it.

		<description><![CDATA[there are a number of articles on quackwatch.org that deal with ghee, as well as studies. here&#039;s one.
http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/PhonyAds/ghee.html
Can Fit in a Bottle of Ghee?
Stephen Barrett, M.D.

Ghee is a semiliquid form of butter from which the water and milk solids have been removed by heating and straining. Since ghee is 100% fat (approximately 14 grams per tablespoon), and since high-fat diets are known to increase the risk of coronary heart disease, I was surprised to see an ad promoting ghee as a health food. The ad pictured below was distributed in 1998 by Maharishi Ayur-Ved Products International, a prominent marketer of ayurvedic products. The ad states that, &quot;For thousands of years, Ghee has been used for its many healthful values.&quot; That statement is literally true because ghee is an Indian folk remedy. But whether eating it promotes health is another story. The product retails for $7.95 for 13 ounces or $12.95 for 28 ounces, which is much more than the cost of ordinary butter.

To investigate, I used PaperChase to perform a Medline search for the word &quot;ghee.&quot; This yielded 45 citations, 30 of which were accompanied by abstracts that could be read online. Four studies noted an association between the use of ghee and increased prevalence of coronary artery disease [1-4]. Another report -- from 1978 -- stated that when food is well chewed and the diet contains plenty of vegetable fibres and fermented milk products such as ghee and yogurt, the amount of salivary mucus that is swallowed will increase, which can help protect against peptic ulcers. However, with modern ulcer treatment available, there is no reason to believe this potential benefit outweighs the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The rest of the studies did not appear relevant to the claims in the ad.]]></description>
