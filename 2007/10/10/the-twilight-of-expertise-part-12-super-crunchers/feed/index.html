		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what&#039;s keeping Dr. Consorti so busy. She obviously doesn&#039;t spend her time making sure her patients are receiving the quality care they deserve. If she would&#039;ve taken the other 30 minutes required for my surgery, maybe the skin from both sides of my incision would match up. Thanks to her, I&#039;ll probably be having another surgery down the road to remove scar tissue from her horrific attempt at stitching. Maybe she should&#039;ve taken HomeEc before going to med school.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re linking two transitions: (A) from hunter-gatherer to agricultural economics, and (B) from expert to math-model decision-making. Okay, each involves a replacement of creativity/expertise by a routine. We might throw in (C) the industrial revolution, where Adam Smith&#039;s pin factory replaces craftmanship by assembly-line production. However, the &quot;Super-Cruncher&quot; transition (B) seems to me to be fundamentally different in that the routine is to be carried out by a computer.  The expert is upset at losing status, but the resulting society is not one of increased drudgery; it&#039;s simply a society in which people (patients, sports teams, investors, customers, governments) depend less on human experts and more on their &quot;own&quot; (computer) resources, as fed by their own intuitions and web-collected data from all over the world. See page 124: &quot;The most important thing that is left to humans is to use our minds and our intuitions to guess at what variables should and should not be included in statistical analysis.&quot; This may be intrinsically closer to a hunter-gatherer structure after all; there&#039;s no hierarchy of experts, perhaps no hierarchy of authority at all. 
  Of course we will need Gelmans for a while, but in the end perhaps we can breed good modeling algorithms via genetic algorithms; if experts are replaced by algorithms, meta-experts may be replaced by meta-algorithms. And then the Singularity? Well, maybe. It is a step in that direction, whether the journey continues or not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Philip Tetlock&#039;s book on expert political prediction &quot;Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?â€ found 
(http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/05/051205crbo_books1)
it to be largely bogus, as I understand it. The New Yorker summarized his findings. Even rats made better predictions than Yale students at a particular task.
From Louis Menand&#039;s New Yorker article:
&quot;It is the somewhat gratifying lesson of Philip Tetlockâ€™s new book, â€œExpert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?â€ (Princeton; $35),that people who make prediction their businessâ€”people who appear as experts on television, get quoted in newspaper articles, advise governments and businesses, and participate in punditry roundtablesâ€”are no better than the rest of us. When theyâ€™re wrong, theyâ€™re rarely held accountable, and they rarely admit it, either. They insist that they were just off on timing, or blindsided by an improbable event, or almost right, or wrong for the right reasons. They have the same repertoire of self-justifications that everyone has, and are no more inclined than anyone else to revise their beliefs about the way the world works, or ought to work, just because they made a mistake. No one is paying you for your gratuitous opinions about other people, but the experts are being paid, and Tetlock claims that the better known and more frequently quoted they are, the less reliable their guesses about the future are likely to be. The accuracy of an expertâ€™s predictions actually has an inverse relationship to his or her self-confidence, renown, and, beyond a certain point, depth of knowledge. People who follow current events by reading the papers and newsmagazines regularly can guess what is likely to happen about as accurately as the specialists whom the papers quote. Our system of expertise is completely inside out: it rewards bad judgments over good ones.&quot;
Why am I not surprised?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You get some of the elements of hunting-gathering, at least of the gathering part, by shopping, hence, presumably, its popularity.  Other elements can come from frantically running around to do small one-shot freelance jobs and tasks, such as being a taxi driver searching for fares.  Video games presumably satisfy other elements of the faux-hunter lifestyle, or certain physical recreations such as hide-and-seek.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure, but what you call &quot;the math models&quot; (I would call them &quot;statistical models&quot; since I think when you fit a mathematical model to data, it&#039;s a statistical model) need experts to run them well.
