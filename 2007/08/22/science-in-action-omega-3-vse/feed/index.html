		<description><![CDATA[My non-rigourous observation after doing 3-4 tablespoons a day of flax seed oil is that yes, it does enhance mental functioning. I&#039;ve been reading and writing poetry furiously all summer, and have reached degrees of comprehension in reading and interesting associations in writing that I never got to before. 

One caveat: I also have done a lot of reading poetry out loud; reading aloud according to a Japanese neuroscientist oxygenates the brain more than any other activity tested. That is a confound. But I&#039;m staying with the flax seed oil until I am given a reason not to...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, no, I&#039;m not worried that the results are due to expectations. If the results always conformed to my expectations, I&#039;d be worried, but they haven&#039;t -- see my post about eggs. Moreover, this particular result confirms a result that was a surprise. In other words, I&#039;ve gotten the same result when I was expecting it and when I wasn&#039;t expecting it. 

Peter, thanks for the suggestion. I&#039;m going to start by testing common foods, such as salmon, and easy-to-get foods, such as my 8 remaining grass-fed eggs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;d be a great way for a grad student to make a hell of a name for himself -- do your protocol on every spice in the spice aisle, every oil in the oil aisle, every grain in the bread aisle.  

Headlines would be generated like clockwork:
Dough Makes You Dopey.  
Fish Before Physics.
Memory Gone?  Tarragon!]]></description>
