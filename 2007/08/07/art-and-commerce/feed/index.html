		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Blue pots&quot; are sometimes used a shorthand among the potters I know to talk about pots that are ugly (to them) but commercially successful.  Perhaps &quot;crafty&quot;.  Some feel that it&#039;s because browns and oranges are the colors good potters are most drawn too, and that a less educated eye goes for something like a blue.  My personal opinion is that blue is just generally popular, and that making blue pots you can be a successful potter even if you aren&#039;t very good at it, and a lot of the business you do is based on the initial impression (where blue does well), not necessarily the richness of the lifetime of experience a person might have with their purchase.  

As a result of all this, I&#039;ve seen potters start to associate poor craftmanship with the color blue, perhaps unfairly hating blue as a result -- the color is more of a crutch than a flaw in itself.  Though there are other things too -- thick, opaque glazes tend to obscure the form, for instance, so it helps the poor potter and obscures the work of the good potter.

Anyway, touches on some interesting details of the craft I suppose.]]></description>
