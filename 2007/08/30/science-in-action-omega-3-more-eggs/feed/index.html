		<description><![CDATA[What method did you use to test the Omega-3 levels in the eggs?  Did you test your blood or did you test the egg yolks themselves?  Do you know of a machine or piece of equipment on the market that can test for Omega-3 levels in egg yolks?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eggs are the only food I&#039;m allergic to.  It actually took me years to figure out that egg consumption the cause of the problem which manifested itself as a severe lack of energy.  For example, I could walk very slowly but not quickly and not run even a few steps.  (And this could go on for hours.) My understanding is that this could have been an immune response provoked by egg protein getting into my circulatory system somehow.

I mention this because allergy to eggs is very common and could be a confounding factor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Very interesting results.  This might be a good opportunity to test the effect of high and low omega-3 eggs without knowing which ones you are consuming in advance (assuming the eggs taste the same).]]></description>
