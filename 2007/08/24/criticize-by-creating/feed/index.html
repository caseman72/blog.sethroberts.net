		<description><![CDATA[What harm did Mackey&#039;s anonymous posts do? Given hundreds or thousands of people posting, I would think it is awfully hard to know that one of them had a big effect. And even harder to know the direction of that effect.

The merger is a good thing because Whole Foods is much better run than Wild Oats. The better WF policies, etc.,will replace the worse WO policies, etc.

Whole Foods&#039; main competition, Mackey has said, is Trader Joe&#039;s. Trader Joe&#039;s is not going away.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t agree that Mackey&#039;s false and misleading posts made under the guise of being just another investor were harmless.  They were probably illegal and he should be pursued (and probably will be civilly) 
I also don&#039;t agree that the merger is a good thing.  stores will be closed and competition will be reduced.  how is that good thing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought it was interesting that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/12/business/pseudo.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;for years John Mackey participated anonymously in Yahoo financial bulletin board discussions about Whole Foods and Wild Oats&lt;/a&gt;. When his avatar was outed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/blogs/jm/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;he temporarily discontinued posting to his blog while the matter was investigated&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder if he&#039;ll resume posting now, anonymously or otherwise. What do you think about it?]]></description>
