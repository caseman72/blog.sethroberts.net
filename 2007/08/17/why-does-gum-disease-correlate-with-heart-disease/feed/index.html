		<description><![CDATA[My own take on this is somewhat different.

I have rheumatoid arthritis and chronically elevated CRP (C-Reactive Protein) levels, indicating high levels of inflammation in my body. I also have healthy pink gums. This may be as a result of drinking the oil - certainly in part I&#039;m sure. But despite the health of my mouth, I continue to have high inflammation levels elsewhere in my body.

One thing I have noticed (as I do not take the oil religiously, but rather sloppily, and thankfully still have weightloss, albeit slow), is that the &#039;fur&#039; on my tongue is considerably less whenever I drink the oil. I use hempseed oil, and this is known to have mild antibacterial and anti-fungal properties.

There is virtually no tongue &#039;fur&#039; when I use the oil, and there can be quite a lot when I don&#039;t, especially if I eat a lot of sugar. I use oral steroids, such as prednisone, to combat my arthritis and these meds and others make me prone to being a bit yeasty. I think this may be what the &#039;fur&#039; on my tongue is, or else it&#039;s bacterial.

Either way, I wonder whether the flaxseed oil you use Seth is antibacterial/antifungal as well? And whether keeping the mouth bacteria down is what&#039;s keeping your gums (and hopefully heart) healthy.

I agree that CRP is a major marker for heart disease, much more so than cholesterol or good/bad fats, but as my CRP is always very high - always more than 20 and often more than 60 - and my gums are pink and tongue free of fur, it makes me wonder if the oil is controlling bacteria, more than inflammation?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gum disease and heart disease may be associated because each is associated with diabetes/metabolic syndrome. Inflammation plays a role in MetS, as well, but whether it&#039;s as cause or effect is unknown. Poor diet in general, not only the lack of omega-3 fats, is implicated. Omega-3 fats correct some but not all of the lipid abnormalities of MetS.]]></description>
