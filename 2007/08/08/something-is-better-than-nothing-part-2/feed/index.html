		<description><![CDATA[This is a hot debate regarding lung cancer screening. Researchers at Cornell led by Dr. Claudia Henschke have for years published data from their observational studies that found low-dose CT screening in high risk subjects saves lives. Henschke et al screen all subjects with CT and then randomize them to either treatment or not treatment. 

On the other side, are investigators for the National Lung Screening Trail, an 8-year, $200 million NIH RCT study whose results won&#039;t be available until 2010. In this trial, subjects are randomized to either CT or chest x-ray. 

The observational studies have looked at thousands of cases, amassed impressive data not only regarding the efficacy of screening but also protocols for reducing false positives and downstream invasive procedures, and protocols for observing differences in lesion makeup and minute lesion growth. A model they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/cardiovascular/journal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199905821&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;constructed&lt;/a&gt; claims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 80% when caught early in stage I, which is what screening does. 

The folks at NLST always point out that Henschke et al have not proven that screening actually saves lives. The observational researchers claim to have an effective &quot;cure&quot; rate, which they extrapolate to a reduction in mortality. But the NLST investigators claim that many of the cancers found by Henschke et al are indolent and not biologically dangerous. Subjects would have died by other causes with those lesions present. NLST advocates claim that Henschke et al muddy the waters talking about cure rates rather than a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/cardiovascular/feature/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=198700571&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reduction in deaths&lt;/a&gt;. They claim that only the RCT study will prove whether CT screening reduces mortality or not. In the meantime, their best advice is to quit smoking. 

And so it goes. At medical conferences, these two opposing camps sometimes snipe and spar with each other, obfuscating any real news that might be presented. 

In the meantime, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201203019&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;British panel&lt;/a&gt; has deemed lung cancer screening safe and effective based on the Cornell research. 

David Yankelevitz at Cornell wrote a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199701411&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; dissecting the two approaches.]]></description>
