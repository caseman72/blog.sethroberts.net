		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s the freakiest thing I ever heard of... not really, but pretty weird, and quite cool.  Is it something that you would consider?  What are the benefits, apart from being able to sense stuff.... given that some animals (pigeons, sharks) navigate using the earth&#039;s electromagnetic field, would there ever be a time when enough magnets could be inserted into the human body to enable this?]]></description>
