		<description><![CDATA[Maybe the visual stimulus of product packaging has a similar effect.  Seeing the packages of favorite foods in your fridge or on the shelf may trigger hunger.  I wonder what would happen if you repackaged your food in generic containers, or in the containers of non-edible products such as shampoo and soap?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wouldn&#039;t this theory predict that city residents would be fatter, or at least hungrier, than suburbanites?  For instance, New Yorkers walk past a great number of restaurants daily, whereas suburbanites are exposed less often, because there are fewer restaurants in the suburbs, and residents are more likely to quickly drive past them rather than walk past, thus experiencing them for less time.   Maybe all of the city dwellers&#039; walking makes up for their increased exposure to food signals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That actually makes sense if they are wearing the scents at times when they are *not* eating. I&#039;ll have to look around for the studies you refer to, should be interesting reading to find out.

In my case, I am referring to the combination of &quot;flavorless&quot; calories (a la SLD) combined with a food-associated scent, which when combined essentially makes a meal. lol!

		<description><![CDATA[Actually there is a fair amount of research showing fragrances can lead to weight loss in people, probably be interfering with the process by which the brain learns taste/calorie associations. One study found that people wearing a vanilla scented band, I think, on their wrist lost weight compared to a control group who did not. That was a few years ago; I know a lot more has been done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually this brings up a point on SLD that has me a bit concerned. As a woman, I love to lather myself with lotions and ungents and balms, and I know it doesn&#039;t seem like that has anything to do with SLD or set point levels. But have you looked at the high-end lotions and lip balms these days? &quot;Vanilla-Fig&quot; and &quot;Rasberry-Peach&quot; and &quot;Mint Julep&quot; and &quot;Mango Melon&quot; and on and on. I&#039;ve started using blah unscented lotions and lip balms because I&#039;m concerned about the smell/flavor/calorie connection, although I felt silly about it. Reading this, I think I&#039;m not so off the mark. I often use lotions first thing after a shower, and just a few minutes before I down my flavorless calorie dose. I suppose I should be wary of VCO as well, as it has a strong coconut smell to it. I could also move my dosage to later in the morning. Hmmm. Time to experiment.
