		<description><![CDATA[Hi, 

I&#039;ve recently come across the overall benefits of oil pulling.  I have self-diagnosed myself to having periodontal disease. I just recently came back from the dentist who used up all of my insurance money for a root canal. He told me that I have a receding gum line and suggested that I brush my teeth in a more gentle manner. (NO mention of periodontal disease at all!) Now I cannot go to a periodontist for a more professional opinion due to my lack of funds.

I am convinced that I have gum disease. Does anyone know of a natural way to reverse periodontal disease and stimulate gum re-growth? Is oil-pulling an effective solution? Does the type of oil matter? I recently came across  an article suggesting that Omega 3 fish oil is excellent for oral health.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;ve found oil pulling with coconut useful. chia seed is also good source of omega 3, and it doesnt have the same issues of rancidity that flax seed can. personally i use green pasture femented fish oils - but not everyone might like that. i recently read the connection between gum health and q10. so i thought i might add the q10 thing in! declines after 30 :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The thing I can&#039;t get around is eating oil.  It&#039;s just icky.  Swallowing the tablespoons of oil just makes me queasy and the taste ain&#039;t all that great either.  I was messing more with hemp oil than flax, and it&#039;s like drinking oily grass.  Plus there&#039;s the whole mouth coated in oil thing that&#039;s a little nasty.  But, looking at the oil pulling stuff, maybe I should reconsider that.  Perhaps something that would be good to do before bed?  Is it good to have the oil sitting in the mouth?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel I have a pretty good ear for truth.  So when I heard of oil pulling I tried it,  seemed logical.  The first time I gagged tried again, same response.  The third time, same day  did it for 10 minutes, teeth were lighter the whites of my eyes lighter, dark circles under eyes lighter.  By the third time I did it , on average I now do it every 3 days, my nails stronger no breakage, cuticles have no dry skin around them, no bad breath, skin less dry not using lotion except face prior to make-up,  no plaque on teeth, no build up after eating, bump on top of head seems a little  I see more results the next day.  I use eye whitener and crest stripes for my teeth afterwards and they do 3x the job they did  before.  I give it the thumbs up.  I&#039;m a nurse assistant in a hospital and looking at most the elderly they are dehydrated from lack of oil I can tell it from their toenails (dry looking and fungal, cracked) also their bowel movements are not regular after usually 3 days of no movement they&#039;ll pile in the hospital the solution I find that is inexpensive and actually good for you is drinking coconut oil.  I know it goes against what your told but coconut oil is good for cardiovascular.  I use two large tablespoons in my coffee with carnation french vanilla cream to taste, take the day off it will clean you out and I do about 3 cups a day like this.  I repeat whenever I don&#039;t  void in under 1 minute.  That&#039;s how well it works]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Consuming oil (I take several including ELOO, macadamia nut oil, flax seed oil, coconut oil, avocado oil) has been beneficial for appetite control (normalizing) and fat loss, per SLD, for me since December 2006. I&#039;m sure it has had unexpected added benefits in a number of other ways, perhaps not immediately measurable or noticeable, including antioxidant effects (omega 3s, etc.) brain function, skin, hair, heart and dental health conditions. 

Peter, oil pulling (I use coconut oil), for oral health, in my experience, makes an immediate noticeable difference: extremely reduced in amount of plaque, a continual freshness of breath, healthy, supple pink gums (they don&#039;t bleed even when using a metal dental pick), less coating on the tongue, etc. I know coconut oil has antibiotic properties, which apparantly contribute to the health of the tissues and teeth. I&#039;ve not had a trip to the dentist since I started oil pulling, but I can personally attest to those benefits in one person&#039;s experience. 

Most recently I am using flax seed oil in a personal recipe I concocted for its external use on my skin. I have rosacea, and I&#039;ve read that flax seed oil is beneficial for the condition. My skin, once oily, has become very dry and scaly from facial rosacea, aging, low-thyroid, sun damage and  possibly, effects of heart medications. With all that in mind, I mixed the oil with several other ingredients known to be beneficial for the skin, including idebenone powder and hyaluronic acid. It has been like a miracle for me -- much different than using over the counter lotions and oils -- for the first time in years, my skin once again has the moisture and oil it needs to be healthy, supple and soft. I still have rosacea, which is possibly a vascular condition, but the scaling that occurs on my skin isn&#039;t apparant. The skin texture has quickly become amazingly like baby skin. I use it full body.  I&#039;m not sure if other oils besides flax seed oil would have the same effect, since I&#039;ve not experimented beyond the one oil, yet.]]></description>
