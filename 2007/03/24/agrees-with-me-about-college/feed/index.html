		<description><![CDATA[If the paul graham essay you link in a more recent post is right (about a major economic shift to most people being self-employed), then college-as-credentials-for-resumes would cease to be a major factor, and thus be less important for leveling. (Most information you learn in college can be learned more efficiently in other ways, so self-employed people would prefer those other ways.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pdf brings up a good point, associated circles altho my take on it is a little different, not social related as he intends it.

Maybe if you&#039;re already middle class and exposed to a range of experiences and knowledge, college is a wash. However, if you&#039;re from the other side of the tracks with diminished social experiences and opportunities, college is a great leveler. It gives you opportunities you&#039;d never had known otherwise. I wasn&#039;t going to find my guru cleaning sewers. In the end, college is only what you put into it and what you take away; it&#039;s a smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord and I couldn&#039;t eat enough.]]></description>

The problem with Apprenticeship and Gurus is to find one and get accepted by them.

How to enter the social group you are interested in would be a good subject. many times it is not so easy as just asking them or showing interest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing about college that I&#039;m not sure how you&#039;d get in an alternative system is that you meet a lot of people in your major and the associated social circles that are much more like you, on average, than anyone you&#039;ll ever meet anywhere else. This is a great place to find a wife or husband, and a great place to form contacts you could use in the future. You can meet business partners to start a company with. I certainly don&#039;t like most aspects of college, but the social aspects are very important for some people.]]></description>
