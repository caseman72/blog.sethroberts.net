		<description><![CDATA[College rankings have documented effects on school behavior (see, for example, 
Monks and Ehrenberg, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1254/is_6_31/ai_58178197 ).  Rankings tend to be based on reputational measures presumably in part because these are easy to get ahold of.

Ideally what you&#039;d want is a greater emphasis on outcomes, since presumably good outcomes reflect good educations provided that you control for things like entering SAT scores, student socioeconomic characteristics, etc.  I think the Spellings Commission is on to something in their emphasis on school transparency and outcome measures.

Check out

and

for some ideas on how rankings might be restructured to better reflect student interests.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How do they define the best teachers?

I like demand driven education.  I like the &quot;Fab Lab&quot; idea that comes from MIT:

http://fab.cba.mit.edu/

With demand driven education, the students clearly want the knowledge, and make sure they get it.  With our current model, students tend to want a good grade, which is why I wondered about the definition of &quot;best teacher.&quot;

Education was a luxury good, bought by only those who had enough money, time, and interest to take advantage of it.  Now we have a model in which people are forced into it, don&#039;t want to be there, and don&#039;t care very much about the subject matter.]]></description>
