		<description><![CDATA[You have previously blogged on the beneficial effect of Omega 3 on Bone strength and this http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/news/ng.asp?n=75128-omega-dha-blood-pressure is reporting on the benefits of omega 3 on blood pressure. While there is lots of evidence that omega 3 may be helpful in depression there are also meta analysis like this one http://press.psprings.co.uk/dtb/February/dtbfeb.pdf that are skeptical.
It worries me that some of the meta-analysis are including in their evidence reports that common sense tells us won&#039;t have any chance at all of having an impact. 
Is is likely that a body that has been starved of omega 3 since before conception respond in 6 weeks to an amount of DHA less than half the amount most experts think it the daily requirement?
If you are programmed to spend $4000 a day will paying into your bank account $200 correct your overdraft?
Clearly their are nutrional research scientists who think it prossibly will.]]></description>
