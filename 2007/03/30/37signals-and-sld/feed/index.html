		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad i reread that a few times. I was gonna ask how you came to the conclusion that nose HAIR clipping helps makes any food a weight loss food :) Flax seed is awesome for a lot of things. Along with Grape seed oil and my favorite super healthy oil comma Hemp seed oil. I dont know if youve gotten to do any research on hempseed oil but its been shown to have one of the most perfect balances of omega 3 and 6 fatty acids as well as the highest percentage of EFAs at 75-80%. Its also awesome in that it doesnt go rancid as easily or quickly as easily as flax seed oil. I know most health food stores like whole foods now carry it. you should check it out if you havent already. This is the first time I&#039;ve stumbled upon the shangri-la diet. so more flavorless fatty oils are good&gt;? I can dig it. I have read a lot about how the diets of odler generations were a lot higher in fat content. I&#039;ll check out the book!@]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Here are some ways the Shangri-La Diet has been improved by feedback (almost all from the SLD forums):

1. It is much clearer what rate of weight loss to expect.&quot;

-- It is?  I&#039;ve been reading the forums and find conflicting and confusing info is all over the place.   I&#039;d love to have a clearer idea of what rate of weight loss to expect, and how that will be shifted by how much or little I reduce my caloric intake.]]></description>
