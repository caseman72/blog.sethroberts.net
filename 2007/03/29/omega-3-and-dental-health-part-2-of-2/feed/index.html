		<description><![CDATA[120 calories was before I started eating lots of chocolate and drinking my share of wine. However the 480 calories (= 4 T flaxseed oil)  I&#039;m at now is because of what I have learned about the effect of flaxseed oil on my balance -- 3 T is better than 2 T, I learned, so perhaps 4 T is better than 3 T. Whether 4 T is better than 3 T I don&#039;t know.

whether 480 calories is really my maintenance dose now I don&#039;t know. My maintenance dose will depend on how much chocolate &amp; wine I consume and those amounts aren&#039;t fixed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

A while ago, didn&#039;t you determine that your maintenance SLD dose was 120 cal/day?  That was in the sugar water days, I believe.  Did I remember that correctly?  If so, now that you are consuming 480 cal/day of oil, has your set point fallen even more, or are there diminishing returns on the extra 330 SLD cal/day?  Throughout these experiments, have you noticed a change in appetite/set point as you have increased your SLD calories from 120/day to 480/day?  Thanks much.]]></description>
