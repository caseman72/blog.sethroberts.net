		<description><![CDATA[I agree. Not only the beneficiaries. I spoke to a doctor who works in a hospital. We can&#039;t really help most of the people we see, she told me. So why do you do it? I asked. Why not do something that helps, such as prevention? Because I like to be thanked, she said.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that one reason for the emphasis on cure rather than prevention is that the beneficiaries of a cure get to see the benefit while the beneficiaries of prevention generally don&#039;t have access to high credibility information confirming  the effects of not taking the preventative action.  
Too much low quality information or interested propaganda, for instance the sort of &quot;health&quot; education that takes place in public schools, goes under the guise of prevention.  It isn&#039;t easy or convenient for individuals to state outright disbelief, due to authoritarian pressure, but it is easy for them to base their behavioral decisions on the imitation of others rather than on an attempt to infer the behaviors implied by official dogma.  This is, sadly, terribly costly, as it prevents them from benefiting from legitimate prevention.]]></description>
