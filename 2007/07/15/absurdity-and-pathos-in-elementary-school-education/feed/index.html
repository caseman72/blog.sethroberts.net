There is also a link to a very comprehensive study of research into dyslexia and reading difficulties and its implications for the teaching of reading to both adults and children.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well here are few links to get you started.

Reading First
http://www.ed.gov/programs/readingfirst/index.html

Star Test
http://star.cde.ca.gov/

CA standards (notice how kindergarteners need to know how to read...)
http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/index.asp

The *only* two approved reading curriculums in CA are...
Houghton Mifflin
http://www.eduplace.com/index.jsp?state=ca&amp;audience=_t&amp;submit.x=49&amp;submit.y=12&amp;submit=About+submit+buttons 
Open Court
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Court_Reading 

I am a total proponent of public school, I just believe that No child left behind (which is being abandoned in Houston where all these &quot;reforms&quot; began) has purposfully been destroying public school curiculum.
http://www.fairtest.org/nclb%20flaw%20fact%20sheet%201-7-04.html

This is a great article but the real problem is...
&quot;NCLB&#039;s obsessive focus on raising test scores will mean an increasing emphasis on test preparation, undermining the higher order thinking skills all students need to succeed in work and life?

  The reason your public school is probably so nice is that it is not a star or reading first school that trades funding for curriculum constriction.  Schools that have the majority or more of kids receiving free or reduced lunch (don&#039;t start me on the crap they serve the kids daily) are eligible for these programs that cramp teachers, especially good teachers&#039; style.

I adore the teachings of Dr. Mel Levine

		<description><![CDATA[Let me just post one positive thought about SF Public schools.  I have two kids right now in the SF Public school - and one more to come - and I do think every school and every teacher is different.  While I do not doubt some of the realities that you bring up, we have NOT had this experience nor have any of our many friends in public school here in the city.  I also don&#039;t think this kind of rigidity is only present in the Public school.  As we went through our &quot;middle class progressive angst&quot; when choosing a school for our kids, we looked at MANY private schools.  Some where great, creative, etc while others were far more rigid and elitist that ANY public school could or should ever be.  When it got right down to it, we choose public because we felt our kids worldview would have the greatest chance at expanding in this setting.  Not for every family OR teacher, but has been great for us and our kids.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Depressing indeed, but I don&#039;t doubt it.  When I was in elementary school, I read the whole &quot;Reader&quot; in one day and spent the weekend doing the homework in the associated booklet so I would never have to look at it again.  I got in trouble for not following instructions and the teacher took away my booklet and gave me a new one so I would have to do it with the other students.  I also have memories of frequently getting in trouble for reading &quot;real books&quot; during lessons- and yes, I began hiding them in the text book as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rob, it sounds too one-size-fits-all for me. I tried assigning self-experimentation to my intro psych students. I stopped after I decided too many of them were making up the data. I wasn&#039;t delusional; a University of Pennsylvania student told me that no thesis gets written at Penn without at least some fraud. 

I think you can talk about self-experimentation and you can allow it. I&#039;d never force anyone to do it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That`s so sad.  When I was in elementary school I was really good at reading so the teacher assigned me a report on rainbows to show for the class.  I worked really hard on it and it gave me a lot of confidence to learn English.

I was also in something called &quot;expanded learning program&quot; (ELP) throughout middle school that encouraged this kind of learning, but I always thought it should have been how they taught everyone.  Instead it was criticized for being selective.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;m a former teacher and current ed school student.  When I read this blog, I always think of how exciting it would be to incorporate kind of self-experimentation into the secondary science or health classroom--and maybe some kind of group self experimentation.  At the very least, you could have kids track what they eat and their moods afterward and try to determine the relationship.  You&#039;d somehow have to avoid encouraging kids to experiment with dangerous things, though.  Any thoughts on this?]]></description>
