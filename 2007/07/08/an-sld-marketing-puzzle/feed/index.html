		<description><![CDATA[Yes, it is plotted on a log scale. When counts are plotted on square root or log scales, the variability is usually constant with changes in level -- one of the big reasons for the transformation. This data violates that expectation.

If it were plotted on a &quot;raw&quot; (untransformed) scale, the reduction in variability would still be obvious because the pre-interview values cover such a wide range.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It looks like you have this plotted on some sort of log scale.  If you take it off that scale, my guess is there isn&#039;t much decrease in variability.]]></description>
