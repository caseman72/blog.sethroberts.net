		<description><![CDATA[The &quot;everyone wins&quot; fact you highlight when it comes to sharing knowledge is strongly resonant of Robert Wright&#039;s main points in his book Non-Zero - working our way toward more and more &quot;non-zero sum&quot; games, as history proceeds...blogs are a sort of non-zero space where ideas can be discussed/shared in a safe environm&#039;nt. Good book- also great post. Thanks]]></description>

This issue is being addressed through research that generates a synthetic image with eye contact using stereo reconstruction.&quot;]]></description>
