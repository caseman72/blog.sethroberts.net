		<description><![CDATA[A practice explanation doesn&#039;t explain why the improvement started exactly when she started the flaxseed oil. It should have started after the very first trial.

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s neat to look at an older population, and wonder if it would work, but what it looks like to me is like your mom&#039;s balance improved with practice as her ankle muscles strengthened since the improvement didn&#039;t go away when she stopped the flaxseed oil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Flax oil tastes bad for me too. I donÂ´t hink it can be used in salads as some advertisements claim. Do not think bad taste means the oil is in bad condition. If it is rancid you will notice.

I see bottles are not kept in the refrigerator in shops, but  I think this is important after opening. Bottles shold be dark to protect from light.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thanks for the help.

its probably a good idea to cut my losses and head for Whole Foods.   Keeping flaxseed oil refrigerated must lessen the chance of it spoiling.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You should be able to find flaxseed oil at upscale supermarkets such as Whole Foods. They store it in a refrigerated case.

I started with flaxseed oil capsules from Long&#039;s Drugs (house brand) that were not refrigerated. They produced the effect. However, I agree with your pharmacist, although I hope to study the question experimentally.

I now use flaxseed oil in liquid form because I use much larger doses. I think flaxseed oil goes bad quickly but until it comes into contact with oxygen it can&#039;t go bad. So be sure to store it in the refrigerator.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, or anybody else who has a helpful link or information,  it would be great if you posted a flaxseed oil buying guide.  

I had a frustrating experience trying to buy flaxseed oil today.  Target, Kroger, and Meijer didn&#039;t have it. then I went to walmart (probably not a good idea).  the pharmacist advised me against buying flaxseed oil not stored in a refrigerator.   Next I went to GNC, which also didn&#039;t refrigerate their flaxseed oil.  tired, I gave in and bought it.  

It taste awful.  i thought it would milder and nuttier.  I&#039;m concerned it&#039;s spoiled.   although maybe i&#039;m just not used to it.]]></description>

There are exercises to improve balace but I think Omega3 would help.]]></description>
