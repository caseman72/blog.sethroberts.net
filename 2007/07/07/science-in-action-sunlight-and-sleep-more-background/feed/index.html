		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading about sleep problems. I&#039;ve always been a night owl. It was always hard to get to sleep and hard to wake.  TM helped the falling asleep part but I still woke up not rested. I do wake up better with sunlight.

My doc thinks I have restless leg syndrome. It seems to fit but Mirapex and Requip didn&#039;t work. At first I thought it was a way to sell another drug. The diagnosis does fit though. 

Has any of your research shed any light (no pun intended) on this syndrome?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth told me in 1997 that my biggest problem was going to bed at 3:30 in the morning. I didn&#039;t really change that until December 2003, when I resolved to change my circadian rhythms. I followed some advice from Dement, the Stanford sleep specialist. He suggested, as did Seth, getting sunlight earlier in the day. He also suggested taking a small amount of melatonin, just when it started getting dark, and avoiding sunlight later in the day. I found that the melatonin had the biggest effect; I took about a millogram or less. It tended to make me feel yucky in the morning, but it did make it easier to get up earlier. By Christmas day I was getting up around 8:30 rather than noon. And something extraordinary occurred. I always went for years on Christmas with my girlfriend to her best friend&#039;s house 40 miles away, where her family would be present. We&#039;d spend the day together and go to a Chinese restaurant in the evening. For years, on Christmas day, I always got depressed and felt bad by the end of the day, even though I was around people I liked and cared about. But this time, there was no bad mood; I felt fine. It was amazing, as if I had some protection against all those boring negative feelings. Changing my sleep/wake cycle began a turning point towards enjoying life more.... I began to take pleasure in sleep itself, in the way my body would be gripped by a delicious tiredness that pulled me into bed and how I began to wake up with energy and fun on my mind...]]></description>
