		<description><![CDATA[[...] After I wrote about eating a lot of pork fat and sleeping better, David Shackleford commented that he had a related experience: When he started eating much more animal fat and meat, he started to sleep better. He had posted about his sleep improvement before he read about mine. I asked him for details. He answered: About three weeks ago, I started a carnivorous diet. I did this primarily for its supposed benefit to insulin sensitivity, energy levels, and general health, and also because I wanted to see if it was really possible to thrive on nothing but meat.

		<description><![CDATA[Crazy coincidence...I posted on your boards this morning about starting a  carnivorous diet (zero-carb, mostly meat), and one of the more surprising side effects was improved sleep. After a few days of 60-70% animal fat/ 30% protein and negligible carbs, I sleep like a little baby.

There&#039;s a small community of people (http://zerocarbforlife.com/) out there that believe that all your body needs is meat and water. I&#039;m not sure if I agree with their fanaticism 100%, but testing their theory makes for an interesting experiment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I found this relevant discussion on Ryan Koch&#039;s Matters to Me blog (http://ryan-koch.blogspot.com/) post in which he discusses a Farley Mowet book &quot;The People of the Deer&quot; describing Mowet&#039;s life among a group of Inuit.

&quot;It doesn&#039;t take Mowat long to identify the key ingredient of the Ilhalmiut diet: fat. From his own experience on lean meat for an extended period of time, he describes the vast importance of fat in an all-meat diet through his battle with an affliction which he names, for want of a better term, mal de caribou, also known by a great many arctic explorers, prisoners of war, and human carnivores as rabbit starvation:

... persistent diarrhea was only part of the effect of mal de caribou. I was [also] filled with a sick lassitude, an increasing loss of will to work that made me quite useless ...

Mowat&#039;s guide -- a half-Eskimo, half-white man named Franz -- prepared and administered a peculiar remedy:

... he took out a half-pound of precious lard, melted it in a frying pan, and, when it was lukewarm and not yet congealed, he ordered me to drink it. Strangely, I was greedy for it ... I drank a lot of it, then went to bed; and by morning I was completely recovered ... I was suffering from a deficiency of fat and did not realize it. (p. 88)&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it animal fat itself that is good for us? Or is animal fat a carrier for nutrients that are hard for our bodies to source elsewhere?

The way I see it, humans probably ate a good bit of animal fat for most of their pre-history (until agriculture became widespread). Natural selection, therefore, had time to optimize humans for an environment in which animal fat was consistently part of the diet, and humans may have become dependent on some of the things that animal fat provides in abundance but other food sources do not.

In the last few millennia, if humans stopped eating animal fat, or if the nutrient composition of that fat changed (say because the animals in the human diet became farm raised and grain fed), natural selection would not have had enough time to optimize humans for the changes, and, as a result, humans on a modern diet wouldn&#039;t get enough of the nutrients they used to get from eating the fat of wild animals.

So, adding some animal fat to your diet, especially if that fat approximates the fat of wild animals of yesteryear, is very likely to provide your body with some nutrients you&#039;re not getting enough of in modern times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ashish, yes, I cooked the pork belly pieces for a long time before adding the uncooked miso. The miso is added last and not cooked at all.

I suspect raw bacon has the same benefit. In America, where I couldn&#039;t get pork belly, I often ate raw bacon, although only certain brands were acceptable. I think the bacon is fine because the large surface/volume ratio makes it easy to digest.

Yeah bacon fat should have the same effect. Except you&#039;d need a lot of it. I think it is hard to eat pure fat but a bacon-like ratio of fat to meat is acceptable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aaron, thanks for the correction. Michael, the pig was raised at a boutique small farm but it wasn&#039;t actually grass-fed. What you say is very interesting, though. In Beijing I can compare high- and low-priced pork, which corresponds to the distinction you&#039;re making.

Jarno, that&#039;s right, I don&#039;t have any sleep debt. I always sleep as long as I want. 

Richard, that&#039;s great to know about the connection between your sleep and your change in diet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:

You can indeed get pork belly pretty easily at lots of places here in the south Bay Area (Lunardy&#039;s is a favorite here in San Jose). At any rate, a friend &amp; I cooked some up a few weeks and it was excellent. We&#039;ve since done it again. Pics:

http://freetheanimal.com/2009/09/no-fear-pork-belly-its-whats-for-dinner.html

I can definitely attest to the benefits of high animal fat (I average 70% energy from natural fats). While I have not logged my sleeping hours, I do know that I sleep far, far longer on average than ever before in my life. I used to average 6 hours per night and now it&#039;s about 7-8 almost every night. And very restful sleep.

Another very welcome change over the last couple of years I&#039;ve gradually upped the fat in response to feeling better and better as I have done so is that I can now enjoy laying in bed in a kind of &quot;drift in &amp; out&quot; thing. I could never do that before. I would get antsy and have to get up. It&#039;s quite enjoyable now to be resting but not asleep in the early morning.

Also, I&#039;d note that pre-domestication, wild animals had much less fat than today&#039;s domestic animals have.  It&#039;s probably pretty close to nutritionally optimal to eat bison in the natural ratios of all of the meats they are composed of.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t remember you mentioning whether your sleeping habits are such that you don&#039;t usually accumulate sleep debt. I&#039;m assuming this is the case, based on your descriptions of your general sleeping habits. I&#039;m saying this because sleep debt, if it&#039;s anywhere near significant, has far greater effect on alertness than anything else. 

Also, how well-rested one feels right after waking up is not necessarily a good measure of the quality of the sleep. Say when one has significant amount of sleep debt and starts to sleep it back, one starts to feel more drowsy in the morning for a while, but the day-time alertness still increases. 

In general, all of these effects on the feeling on &quot;well-restedness&quot; in the morning probably require one to be close free of sleep debt. I&#039;d guess someone with significant sleep debt wouldn&#039;t notice any effect from, say, standing on one foot just because the effects of the sleep debt would mask any other effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth - I just heard about this thing called the &quot;fitbit&quot; which can track your sleep while you wear it. I guess it has some kind of algorithm for figuring this out from your movement so it lists how long you laid in bed before sleep plus actual sleeping. It also tracks movement like a pedometer but is supposedly more accurate. It might make some of this data collection easier for you and be a useful tool for self-experimentation if it actually works well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding your first point about the historical levels of fat in our human diets, one of the theories I&#039;ve read is that we would have evolved scavenging first, and had a particular advantage cracking open the skulls of carrion due to our ability to use tools -- which other scavengers lack. This would give us access to the brains, which are 60-70% fat (mostly saturated), and may have contributed to our rapid evolution to hunters with our shorter digestive tracts and our own larger brains. It does seem likely to me that higher levels of animal fat in the diet is healthy.]]></description>
