		<description><![CDATA[Interesting discussion on Effect Measure: http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/10/the_atlantic_article_sur_rebut.php

Main points:

1) Evidence does exist for efficacy of seasonal flu vaccination: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2638553/?tool=pubmed

2) There&#039;s a longstanding controversy over efficacy of seasonal flu vaccine in the elderly, which doesn&#039;t apply to swine flu.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazing article.

So the flu vaccine has never been tested in a double blind trial?  That is astounding.

Seth, you are probably familiar with this blog, but I wasn&#039;t (self experimentation with giving up coffee):

Once something becomes heavily recommended or discouraged, a big problem for epidemiologists arises: the people who follow the advice are likely to be different (e.g., more disciplined, better off) than those that don&#8217;t (the healthy-user bias).

		<description><![CDATA[What I got was that people who wouldn&#039;t die from flu are less likely to catch it if stuck, but that people who can die from it catch it despite being stuck, and die anyway.  Also, so many people skip getting stuck and catch it and spread it that the people who don&#039;t because they were stuck don&#039;t help.  Probably if everybody healthy got vaccinated, the difference would be enough to avoid exposing the weak (who get no direct benefit from being stuck), but you never get more than 50% coverage.  50% coverage just isn&#039;t enough to provide cover for anything virulent.]]></description>

As if interpreting data and slowly digesting the myriad of subtleties in hundreds peer-reviewed publications were a trivial exercise.
