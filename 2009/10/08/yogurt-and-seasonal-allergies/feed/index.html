		<description><![CDATA[I think dead bacteria stimulate the immune system. I can&#039;t think of any reason they wouldn&#039;t and lots of dead stuff improves immune function (e.g., hormesis). Unlike live bacteria, dead bacteria don&#039;t improve digestion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a question about cooking with fermented food.  My husband and I  have developed an appetite for umami, and we often use fermented foods to flavor our cooking - kim-chi in a stir-fry, fermented tofu in scrambled eggs, etc.  It tastes great, but it must kill off most of the bacteria, right?  Are we reaping any benefit (besides gustatory) from eating cooked/dead bacteria?

Thanks for a great blog!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few years ago, I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. I didn&#039;t have symptoms constantly, but when they did occur---maybe every 3-4 weeks---it was terrible.

About six months ago I started eating yogurt every day. I also eat Indian food 2-3 times a week with large amounts of raita. Raita is more sour than typical commercial yogurt, so I assume it has more bacteria. I haven&#039;t had any IBS symptoms since I started the fermented foods.]]></description>
