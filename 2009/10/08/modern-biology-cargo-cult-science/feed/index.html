		<description><![CDATA[I think your criteria is so different than most people&#039;s as to be worth defining at the outset of your argument.  

It seems to me you have a really good point in &quot;it is a Good Thing to create new techniques for ameliorating human suffering&quot; and the point is well supported by the examples of scurvy and smoking.  

Why not just make that argument, instead of saying do this stuff instead of doing basic, not immediately useful research?  I don&#039;t see how they are mutually exclusive at all--the argument then is that the nobel prize committee (and the world at large) should start giving this sort of practical pursuit more prestige.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;People who develop cures for diseases aren&#039;t scientists, they&#039;re engineers.&quot; That&#039;s an interesting idea. Obviously the person who invented the laser printer was an engineer rather than a scientist. In the life sciences I think it is more complicated. What about those who develop prevention -- scientists or engineers? And what about me? I developed the Shangri-La Diet. It was based on a new theory of weight control. Surely my new theory was science. And then I went further and used my new theory to develop new weight-loss methods, playing engineer, you would say. But at least my theory had a concrete practical application. My criteria for &quot;real science&quot; is higher than what Feynman was talking about, true -- higher than &quot;publishing papers&quot; and &quot;learning something&quot;. My criteria is: solve everyday problems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that the prize was awarded for biochemical work, and that the committee was probably stretching its charter.  That doesn&#039;t make the work &quot;cargo cult science&quot;: we really did learn important details about how cells work.  It just wasn&#039;t, strictly, &quot;medicine&quot;. 

People who develop cures for diseases aren&#039;t scientists, they&#039;re engineers. People who treat patients aren&#039;t scientists, they&#039;re technicians. It&#039;s customary to look down on engineers and technicians, and resist calling high-status physicians that, but it&#039;s just snobbishness.  Much of the body of scientific knowledge originates in the work of technicians and engineers, usually without proper credit, and much of the social good that people trained to be scientists do isn&#039;t really science at all.

To say something is cargo cult science is to say people do the things they see scientists doings -- getting grants, publishing papers -- but we don&#039;t learn anything.  The most visible current example is String Theory.  Much of cosmology qualifies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The biologists I know stand no chance of getting a Nobel, howsoever good their science, because there&#039;s no Nobel for biology.  It&#039;s for medicine.  Your beef is with followers of &quot;medical science&quot;, not biology. It would probably be easy to get agreement even from the Nobel committee members that the institutional biases of the &quot;medical science&quot; community are very much for expensive treatments, with little interest in systemic or cultural causation.  We are lucky they don&#039;t just award the prize for actual pills.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, your &#039;excellent scientist&quot; friends -- how do they explain the fact that this year&#039;s Nobel Prize in Medicine was given for research that has had no clear practical application?

Vish, I disagree that there is no connection. Modern biologists seem to believe (at least in their public statements) that their research will lead to cures for this and that. They reinforce a medical system focussed on cure rather than prevention.

Rich and Peter, thanks for the correction. I will look into it. Apparently I was wrong about the HPV research. But there are a lot of other examples I could give, such as the claim that oncogenes cause cancer. Many years later, this idea has yet to have practical benefits. Cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, depression, stroke, schizophrenia -- where is the Nobel-Prize-winning research that has led to a reduction in how much we suffer from these problems? The discovery of insulin was long ago.

NE1, &quot;if there is any chance of curing these problems, we must know the science of why they persist.&quot; In fact, scurvy was cured without any detailed understanding of its mechanisms. The discovery that smoking caused lung cancer didn&#039;t require a detailed understanding of lung cancer. The discovery that folate reduces birth defects was made without any detailed understanding of how birth defects arise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So for the record: there IS an HPV vaccine and the stunning decrease in cervical cancer deaths due to the recognition of cervical cancer as a disease with an infectious origin is one of the greatest public health achievements of the last 25 years.  You&#039;re simply way off base on this one. I&#039;d love to have seen some of the public health people involved get credit, but, whatever, discovering HPV causes cervical cancer was really important.

Additionally, while no vaccine is available for HIV (or not, depending on the results of the vaccine in Thailand)  discovery of the virus was necessary to find therapeutic treatments that have lengthened the lifespan of survivors exponentially.]]></description>

Antibiotics don&#039;t defeat HIV, chemotherapy doesn&#039;t eliminate cancer.  If there is to be any chance of defeating these ailments, we must know the science of why they persist.
