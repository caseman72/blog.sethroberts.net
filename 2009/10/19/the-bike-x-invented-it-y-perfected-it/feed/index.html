		<description><![CDATA[Freeman Dyson on bikes:

You can&#039;t possibly get a good technology going without an enormous number of failures. It&#039;s a universal rule. If you look at bicycles, there were thousands of weird models built and tried before they found the one that really worked. You could never design a bicycle theoretically. Even now, after we&#039;ve been building them for 100 years, it&#039;s very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works - it&#039;s even difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial and error, we found out how to do it, and the error was essential.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JLD, those statistics are averages over many places. Where I live it is much safer than usual. There are wide bike lanes and there are many bikes. Because there are so many bikes, people expect them and look for them. This makes them much safer than in places where bikes are less common and where there are no bike lanes. Which is most places.]]></description>
