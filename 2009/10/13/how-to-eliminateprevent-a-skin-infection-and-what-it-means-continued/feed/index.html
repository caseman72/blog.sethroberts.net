		<description><![CDATA[It sounds like you&#039;re aligning with the Natural Hygienists - whose use of the term means something like &quot;living in a way that doesn&#039;t make you ill&quot;.

So your changes in sleep pattern to help with depression, changes in sock washing to help with foot fungus, standing to help with sleeping, might be Hygeinic solutions.

Although the modern use of the term means &#039;sterile&#039; which is a bit misleadingly close.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My objection isn&#039;t to doing n=1 experiments, which I agree is useful.  It&#039;s to the forcefulness with which Seth proclaims things.  He cured allergies!  He cured foot fungus.  He cured X.

Or, every doctor is like this.  Every biologist is like that.  The entire field of public health is like this.

		<description><![CDATA[True, it&#039;s much harder to measure prevented infections than cured infections. But in all of the cases I mention, the treatment method (used to cure) is the same as the prevention method (used to prevent). Just as Vitamin C both cures scurvy and prevents it.]]></description>

&quot;I need an effective means for self experimentation at home&quot;

Check out Facet of Life:

http://facetoflife.com

It&#039;s a barebones, simple platform to help you capture and track your &#039;clinical trials&#039; at home. My friend built it.

Email me if you have any questions.

Best,

		<description><![CDATA[Inoculations are one type of prevention the medical community does seem to have embraced. Brent the healthcare epistemocrat and you have both described consumption of fermented foods as an inoculation of sorts against bad bacteria. The Western medical community is starting to look at probiotics (judging from the increase in scientific medical literature on the subject), but Eastern medicine has embraced it for eons.

On the topic of science as religion: I constantly see scientists who are dogmatic, elitist, and condescending when discussing alternative frameworks to their own deep-seated beliefs. Sounds like a kind of religion to me. I also know many scientists, however, who are NOT like this. No black-and-white here (or in academia, or in the university setting) either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, when I associate religions with black-and-white thinking, I was thinking of three things: (a) division of the world into us (believers) and them (non-believers); (b) the many rules associated with most religions: Do this, do that, you must X, you must Y; and (c) the certainty with which many statements are made -- as if the truth and the difference between right and wrong were so clear-cut. Religions sell certainty. I knew someone who became an Orthodox Jew, I believe, at least partly because it told him how to live.

You&#039;re right that each of these three things can be found outside religions, so the association is hardly perfect. And you might say that the black-and-white thinking came first, it merely found a home in various religions as well as in other places (such as in these scientists&#039; belief systems). But the religions I&#039;m familiar with certainly encourage black-and-white thinking. It doesn&#039;t fit very well with science, but there it is anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I need an effective means for self experimentation at home with my Autism squad. We try new interventions every few months, but we don&#039;t have an effective way to gather enough data to be sure about the efficacy of the things we try. We do evals every few months. We need something lighter to do daily. It needs to be better than just observing and &quot;using the gut&quot; and it needs to survive physical exhaustion of the researchers and little OCD hands.

Maybe we just need to measure our own well being since it is so tied to the kids&#039; behavior on any given day. I always know how _I_ feel.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  I think you&#039;re on stronger ground discussing science than religion.  Requiring double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials may or may not be a good idea, but I don&#039;t see it having much do do with religion, at least not with the religions that I&#039;ve heard of.  I think you&#039;d be hard pressed to find a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in the Bible, for example.  There people often get their religious inspirations directly from God, and any testing of hypotheses is more anecdotal, if at that.

If you don&#039;t like black-and-white thinking, that&#039;s fine, but I don&#039;t see such attitudes as being particularly associated with religion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most of the scientists I know (and Wikipedia editors) would say that your research doesn&#039;t exist because it&#039;s not published in a refereed journal.

The work that gave us the ability to solve differential equations was published by an engineer, Oliver Heaviside, in a city newspaper.  It was later backdated and renamed the &quot;Laplace transform&quot; to sanitize it.  That done, it could then be used by mathematicians and scientists.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kaiser Permanente, seems like the most apt health system in NorCal--nationally, perhaps--to embrace nutritional bricolage and cheap health options since Kaiser&#039;s model integrates the financing and delivery of medical care under one roof/feedback loop. Kaiser has a financial incentive to exhaust low-cost, high-benefit modalities.

Someone just needs to get in touch with CEO George Halvorson and get his buy-in and support. lol. They do their own internal research--published in The Permanente Journal--so that avenue exists as well.]]></description>
