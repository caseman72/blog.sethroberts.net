A recent discussion on PaleoHacks also broaches this subject.  One of the PaleoHackers writes:

&quot;I&#039;m convinced that many forms of mental illness, particularly things like depression, anxiety and insomnia, are caused in large part by not getting enough animal products in your diet -- particularly saturated fat, which is a precursor for a number of hormones that affect mood and energy.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[I use an electric pressure cooker for soup. I imagine that the soup cooker appliance is motivated by the typical Chinese stove having fewer burners than a U.S. stove--is that right? Most U.S. stoves have 4, but in Japan we have 2, so an electric pressure cooker in effect adds a burner for me.

Trichinosis only affects a dozen people a year in the U.S., which shows it&#039;s not that easy to get, considering how many inept cooks there are. If you don&#039;t worry about anthrax or black plague, you shouldn&#039;t worry about trichinosis. I suspect Nile is a PETA guy, or an unsuspecting stooge of their scare tactics. Canada has higher rates from wild game consumption like bear meat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, Nathan Myers and Alrenou-  All ready to eat pork products in the US are heated to at least 150 degrees, considered the safe temperature to kill all trichinosis parasites.  137 degress is the actual temperature at which the parasite dies but because of the possibility of uneven heating pork is heated to 150 degrees to provide a margin of safety.  It is doubtful that a butcher in china has the same sort of rigorious QA that, for example, Hormel does.   I think we all can envision a homemade smokehouse where the temperature does not get above 150 degrees.  Drying or salting does not kill trichinosis.  Once trichinosis gets into the muscle THERE IS NO CURE AND IT IS VERY PAINFUL !!  Besides, there is no downside to cooking pork.  Cooking does not hurt the flavor.   Please, all of you, don&#039;t eat pork that has not been cooked even if it has been &quot;cured&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: parasites, from wikipedia, 

&quot;Bacon is a cured meat prepared from a pig. It is first cured in a brine or in a dry packing, both consisting largely of salt; the result is fresh bacon (also green bacon). Fresh bacon may then be further dried for weeks or months (usually in cold air), boiled, or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon must be cooked before eating. Boiled and smoked bacon are ready to eat, but may be cooked further before eating.&quot;

If the bacon&#039;s ingredients include &#039;smoke&#039; then it&#039;s perfectly safe to eat - it&#039;s already been cooked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Over the last six months I&#8217;ve come to believe that animal fat improves my sleep. Because sleep is controlled by the brain, this suggests animal fat may also improve other measures of brain function, just as omega-3 turned out to improve brain function in a wide range of ways. I didn&#8217;t know about a recent experiment done with airplane pilots that supports that idea. This was the design: A total of 45 pilots (mean age, 20.8 years; 87% male) from the [University of North Dakota] commercial-aviation program were enrolled in this 14-week repeated-measures crossover trial.

		<description><![CDATA[Please don&#039;t eat any more raw pork.

Trichinosis is a nasty little parasite.  Rare in the US because of the sanitary way we raise our pork but common elsewhere.  From the Mayo clinic

&quot;Mebendazole or albendazole can be used to treat infections in the intestines. There is no specific treatment for trichinosis once the larvae have invaded the muscles. The cysts remain viable for years. Pain killers can help relieve muscle soreness&quot;  The larvae can also invade the brain and internal organs.  In case you are unconvinced about how nasty the parasite is you might want to find the YouTube video of a trichinosis worm that was removed from a woman&#039;s brain.  The woman lived in the USA.   Note &quot; There is no specific treatment once the larve have invaded the muscles.&quot;]]></description>
