		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t like preheating the milk for making yogurt. Even though I use a makeshift double-boiler to heat the milk to 180 degrees F the saucepan gets scalded. For the last two batches, I just made the yogurt without preheating the milk. It&#039;s a little runnier, but still tasty and I like it better runny anyway. I wonder if the bacteria count is reduced when I make yogurt without preheating the milk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t been able to find a comparable American model. Nor any way to buy the Chinese one in America. If you buy it in China the current is wrong.

David, the amazon products you link to are different. They use small cups to hold the milk/starter mixture. That means they use space less efficiently, require two more steps (mix starter and milk in separate dish, wash separate dish), and may not heat as evenly. Because of it&#039;s one-big-container design, the Chinese machine can use hot water to improve temperature constancy. That might be important.

Ashish, the Chinese model is designed for Chinese house current, which differs from American current. I will however see if it works with American current.]]></description>
