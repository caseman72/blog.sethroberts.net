		<description><![CDATA[[...] A friend with bipolar disorder writes: When I wrote in your blog that I use your discovery daily, it means that every day I look in a mirror for an hour, starting at approximately 6:30 a.m. I have the mirror about 20 inches from my face because I have read that a mirror image is half the size of the object reflected. [Life-size faces appear to work best. Using a mirror means the face you see is perfectly life-size, allowing for distance. TV faces can be larger or smaller than life-size.] To keep from being bored while looking at my face in the mirror, I mostly listen to tapes of C-SPAN programs. Sometimes I listen to music. Once or twice a week I may just think, or plan my day. That does get boring after about 30 minutes. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] A brief summary of my previous post is all I needed to do to cure/prevent a skin infection was buy more socks. Instead of buying 5 pairs every 6 months, buy 20 pairs every two years. That&#8217;s all. Costs nothing. No drugs. No special treatment of the socks. No special cycle on the washing machine. No following a hundred (or ten) instructions about how to avoid infection. Like my depressed friend, I had the reaction: Why didn&#8217;t my doctor tell me this? He didn&#8217;t tell me because he didn&#8217;t know, I realize. Why he didn&#8217;t know . . . is a harder question. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, I couldn&#039;t disagree more with the example.  And the comment,
&quot;The psychiatrist that doesnâ€™t recommend sleep to a depressed patient is acting in his own self interest.&quot;

Yikes.  They want to keep their patients depressed?!  Why do we have the medical profession in the first place?  Do they give just partial chemotherapy to keep the cancer patient from going into remission, too?

Having participated in a number of fora for depression/mental illness and having both personal and anecdotal experience with depression, I can say that most mental health practitioners (psychiatrists and psychologists) are deeply concerned with making their patients well.  And that includes inquiring about sleep issues, and educating on sleep hygiene, and (yes) prescribing sleep medications when needed.  Some are faster to prescribe medication than others.

If your friend was making the unwise step of going to a general practitioner (GP) for depression treatment, then yes, I wouldn&#039;t expect them to go through a complete lifestyle assessment.  

But any mental health professional worth their degree will check crucial things like sleep, relationships, exercise, and alcohol use, both as symptoms and as lifestyle factors that should be addressed as part of treatment.

Frankly, demand for mental health services is robust and nobody is worried about &quot;running out of patients&quot;, so even if a psychiatrist didn&#039;t have simple compassion, there&#039;s no reason to drag out treatment.

I&#039;m not saying anything about pharmaceutical-pushing/marketing, though; that&#039;s a whole other can of worms.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the case of depression, there is a complication to your argument. Sleep problems are seen as a symptom of depression by conventional medical wisdom -- just try googling &quot;symptoms of depression&quot;.  It is unrealistic to expect the typical practitioner to offer treatments that run counter to the conventional wisdom.

I use your discovery about early-morning faces every day, and my doctors are amazed at my condition. But they have zero interest in acting as &quot;research doctors&quot; with respect to their other clients. Can you really blame them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[EDM is right that we need a correct name for the practice that Seth is describing.  &quot;Rent-seeking&quot; isn&#039;t it; that&#039;s already well defined.  There might be a name already, but it doesn&#039;t come readily to mind.

I recall a story about a free health clinic that moved to the same floor as a legal aid society.  They ended up referring a big fraction of their patients to legal aid instead.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I agree with your greater point.  I only quibble with describing it as rent-seeking.

Rent-seeking happens by manipulating the political environment outside of normal market competition. 

I think the distinction I am trying to make is that I believe rent-seeking is active.  In this example it would be psychiatrists actively working to marginalize alternative remedies.  I don&#039;t think the passive, &quot;not looking for&quot; alternatives rises to rent-seeking...

		<description><![CDATA[EDM, I don&#039;t follow your argument. Rent seeking is one way to act in one&#039;s self interest. Here&#039;s a definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rent seeking &lt;/strong&gt;occurs when an individual, organization or firm seeks to earn income by capturing economic rent through manipulation or exploitation of the economic environment&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Psychiatrists earn income by ignoring remedies that don&#039;t involve them. I&#039;m assuming that the therapeutic environment (what therapies are available and advertised and advised) and research environment (what research is done) are part of the economic environment. They affect what is and isn&#039;t for sale.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t agree with the use of the term rent-seeking.  The psychiatrist that doesn&#039;t recommend sleep to a depressed patient is acting in his own self interest.  He doesn&#039;t&#039; have an incentive to recommend a therapy that will solve the problem without repeat visit. He didn&#039;t go to school for god knows how long to tell people to get better sleep.  He went to school to make people better through the narrow lens of his specialty.

Now, something like the AMA controlling who gets to be a doctor, that is a form of rent seeking.  They are the gatekeepers and the member doctors benefit from that constraint on who can practice medicine.
