That&#039;s surprising that Emory would try to make him delete references to the fact that he was affiliated with Emory. More bad public relations....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not ALL psychiatrists are like that.

Check out this psychiatrist&#039;s blog:
http://www.beforeyoutakethatpill.com/

By the way, this psychiatrist is a professor at Emory, which wasn&#039;t very happy about his blog, and tried to make him delete references to the fact that he was affiliated with Emory from his blog.  The blogosphere supported him in protesting this muzzling, and Emory relented.  

He also has a novel in progress about a psychiatrist doing research on the link between accutane (the acne drug) and suicide, which is understandably unpopular with the drug&#039;s maker.   The psychiatrist-protagonist is based at Emory, where some of his colleagues aren&#039;t too happy with the research either.

I think you&#039;d find the blog and the novel interesting.

Not all psychiatrists think that drugs are the answer to every problem.]]></description>
