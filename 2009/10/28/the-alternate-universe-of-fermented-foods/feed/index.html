		<description><![CDATA[Darrin, that&#039;s interesting that your mom&#039;s kefir fixes allergies but the store stuff doesn&#039;t. 

In Beijing, you can try maybe 20 or 30 fermented foods, various kimchi and pickles, for a buck. They are sold in whatever quantities you want. In Japanese stores, miso is sold in whatever amount you want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My one gripe with fermented foods is can&#039;t go to Walmart and try a new one for a buck. Prepared fermented foods in stores cost a premium and are usually weak.

That&#039;s my other one gripe. If you can find it prepared, it&#039;s weak. At elast that&#039;s been my experience with kefir. My mom in law makes some from unpasturized milk and lets if ferment for longer than the store stuff. The mom stuff fixes allergies. The store stuff is fun but no allergy relief.

I wonder if there&#039;s a market for a food product which is just a bite sized sampling of a bunch of available fermented foods?]]></description>
