		<description><![CDATA[There may be good reasons sometimes as to why these projects do change in their price tags over time. I have seen several projects like this and clearly remember a prof at MIT showing us why (I need to dig his name up, I think it was Michael Golay, http://web.mit.edu/nse/people/faculty/golay.html). 

The idea was that in a government projects, the customer (the government) ends up changing the requirements of the project many times over the life of the project. These changes of requirements are extremely bad with regards to the flow of execution of the project. 

In the space business for instance, there is one example that is pretty interesting: Spacelab, a large cylinder that goes in the shuttle&#039;s belly for astronauts to do their experiments. A company ended up designing the same cylinder and eventually sold the services to this new cylinder to NASA. It was pretty obvious that the company&#039;s cylinder had cost much less than the original Spacelab built inside NASA. However, as is often the case in comparing gov and private projects, it is a somewhat an unfair comparison as the second cylinder was built with the knowledge of what the first cylinder final requirements were. The big lessons are that in extremely complex projects, sometimes you should not allow your customer to be able to change your requirements as you go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want to say that term is &quot;bailout&quot; but that&#039;s overloaded by the connotation that these things are necessary or inevitable. The story is all wrong.

&quot;Freedom Torches&quot; would be another one. Not very direct but you get to tell the story of the original PR man promoting cigarettes for mommies. It&#039;s got that cynical overtone such a term needs.

Or maybe go the other way with morbidly blank words like, &quot;optional public crisis&quot;, &quot;public insurance,&quot; or &quot;noncompulsary emergency event.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,
I enjoy your blog greatlly. How about &quot;Boondoggle&quot;? as in a boondoggle project, from Wikipedia: &quot;It also refers to government or corporate projects involving large numbers of people and usually heavy expenditure; at some point, the key operators have realized that the project is never going to work, but are reluctant to bring this to the attention of their superiors. Generally there is an aspect of &quot;going through the motions&quot; â€“ for example, continuing research and development â€“ as long as funds are available to keep paying the researchers&#039; and executives&#039; salaries. The situation can be allowed to continue for what seems like unreasonably long periods, as senior management are often reluctant to admit that they allowed a failed project to go on for so long. In many cases, the actual device itself may eventually work, but not well enough to ever recoup its development costs.&quot;]]></description>
