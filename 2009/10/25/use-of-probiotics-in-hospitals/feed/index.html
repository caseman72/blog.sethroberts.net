		<description><![CDATA[Dan, I agree that it might be time for a change, for just the reason you say. Indeed, I think we are in the middle of one. Or more precisely in the midst of the beginning. Self-experimentation is highly subversive; the mere fact that you&#039;re reading this blog is a step forward. Self-experimentation is fundamentally a way to find new ideas. Another piece of a new ecology are Alexandra Carmichael&#039;s CureTogether.com and the similar PatientsLikeMe.com. They are ways of testing new ideas. Both self-experimentation and the websites need no support at all from the health-care establishment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lately there&#039;s been a lot of talk about newspapers looking into going non profit and/or finding a large foundation or single rich guy to support them, just to stay alive, (of course they brought this on themselves but I digress).  The idea is that the republic &quot;needs&quot; big newspapers. This is hogwash but a discussion for another day. It&#039;s the same thing as lobbyists in Washington trying to hold on to their own self interests for the corporations they represent.

The same initiative however, could be directed to a more noble and moral cause, toward finding a foundation to support research into alternative health cures using food or suppliments. This seems like a good group somebody should start up.  The rub on alternative health, from juicing to kefir, has always been that it&#039;s only supported by &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot;.

Your statement above about research money only going to drugs that can be profitable is exactly what&#039;s going on. However in this age of the web and groups forming etc., it seems like now might be the time for a change in this situation.  What do you think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@seth: &quot;We are now stuck with a weird kind of public-health science where the most important study â€” does cheap stuff like kefir and yogurt help? â€” canâ€™t possibly be done and all we have instead are studies of expensive imitations. Itâ€™s like a taxi system where the shortest route from A to B is prohibited; you must take a much longer route. &quot;

Even worse, the failure to fund trials is combined with a suffocating dominance of the perspective of self-styled &#039;evidence-based medicine&#039; (EBM) - including the groundless notion that only mega-trails should be taken seriously. 

http://trialsjournal.com/content/2/1/2

The combination of misunderstanding and consequently overvaluing the function of large trials, with the ignorant denigration of other sources of medical knowledge, means: 1. that progress is only recognized when it is via mega-trails, and therefore 2. he who controls megatrial funding controls &#039;authoritative&#039; medical knowledge. 

Since the vast majority of randomized trials are industry funded, EBM has meant that industry has a de facto monopoly on &#039;reputable&#039; therapeutic knowledge.

Delivering us into the hands of Big Pharma was not - of course - intended by the socialistic founders of EBM, but it has happened nonetheless. However, so long as they get their paychecks and power, the EBM leadership aren&#039;t protesting about the fact.

		<description><![CDATA[That marketing article was interesting but it&#039;s missing some important research from my perspective as a person making his own milk Kefir daily.  I would certainly liked to have seen a comparison of 44 patients who were given freshly made Kefir, perhaps one, two, four and eight cups per day and compare those results with the very expensive Bio-K product. If it works better, more power to it. But it&#039;s hard for me to be convinced a packaged product is of superior value until I see the research backing it up. 

Also interesting to me is this. That scientist from Paris, the one that &quot;discovered&quot; this great new probiotic with so-called healing powers. This person didn&#039;t follow up with the new found knowledge or spread the word so all of mankind could benefit because he couldn&#039;t &quot;market it&quot; ?
Yeah, that&#039;s my kind of guy.]]></description>
