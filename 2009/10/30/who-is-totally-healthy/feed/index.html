		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
Regarding suboptimal sleep and the immune system, I know that sleep deprivation makes one more vulnerable to colds, and in more severe forms has induced diabetic type symptoms in healthy young people. Do we have longitudinal, correlational research showing that people who sleep poorly get more sick and die younger? This research would not be hard to do. Every year, you simply ask people to report on how they have been sleeping for the past year, how many hours, how often they wake up, when they sleep etc... 

I would assume that longitidunal studies would have already covered this, but I&#039;ve never seen it reported. I think you are right but I&#039;d want to see basic correlation between poor sleep and sickness before I would begin to be confident about it...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most of the people killed by the Spanish flu were those whose immune systems responded most vigorously.  

The immune system is, first and foremost, a &lt;i&gt;system&lt;/i&gt; -- that is, a machine based on a model of its environment, and programmed with responses that have worked just well enough in the past to keep enough of a population reproducing that there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a next generation, without costing too much, metabolically.  No model, and no set of programmed responses is perfect, for all possible environments, and pathogens are continually testing the limits of both.  There can be no rational reason to believe that any treatment of the immune system, not even with a brilliantly designed program of bacterial exposure, can change that fundamental fact.

No amount of yogurt can protect you from HIV, or from HPV, or from HSV, or from certain flus.  The immune system isn&#039;t magic, and yogurt isn&#039;t magic.]]></description>
