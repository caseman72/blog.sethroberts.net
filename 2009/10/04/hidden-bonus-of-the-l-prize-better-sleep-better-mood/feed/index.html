		<description><![CDATA[This is really interesting.

I instinctively dislike fluorescent lighting. Now that you mention it, I especially dislike them at night (perhaps because they&#039;re more obvious then). Libraries, for example, with their flickering, buzzing lighting, I find horrible. I find I like the &#039;warmth&#039; of incandescents. This is why the idea of making incandescents illegal makes me angry. I will start up a trade in illegal incandescent lightbulbs before I start using fluorescents (alternately, I would move to candle-light before using fluorescents).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of links claiming connections between cancers and night-time artificial lighting, presumably by disruption of circadian rhythms:
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090203135015.htm
http://www.rd.com/living-healthy/artificial-light-a-hidden-cancer-risk/article128447.html
(The Science Daily page says that energy-efficient light bulbs are much brighter than incandescent lights. I&#039;m not sure what they mean by that. Obviously they&#039;re brighter watt-for-watt, but that&#039;s the whole point.)

My personal bugbear is bright ceiling lighting. Having something shining intensely down on me from overhead when it&#039;s dark outside really unsettles me. That said, I don&#039;t think it much affects the amount or quality of sleep I get, but I haven&#039;t gathered any halfway decent data to support that claim.]]></description>
