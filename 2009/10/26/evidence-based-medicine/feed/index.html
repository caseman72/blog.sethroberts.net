		<description><![CDATA[It really depends how you define evidence.   With EBM if the patient feels better that doesn&#039;t count unless you can measure it, but there are no valid objective measures of &quot;better&quot;.    If your evidence is from a mega trial that shows statistically significant improvement, as it will with a big enough cohort, but is not clinically significant what good is it?  But from EBM viewpoint it&#039;s  a goer.

		<description><![CDATA[A problem with Evidence-Based Medicine is that the evidence is often corrupted by being based on bad science or bad regulation -- making EBM potentially worse than the alternatives. It has the credibility of &quot;evidence&quot; but that evidence can actually be wrong, misguiding the public and policy makers.

Apparently the FDA approval process only requires drug companies to submit a certain number and type of studies, and in the case of SSRIs this has meant that if they do a study showing a lack of efficacy of their tested product they don&#039;t have to submit that result for consideration. They can ignore ten negative results, as long as the submitted studies suggest efficact.

 Similarly, if they are in the midst of a study whose outcome is likely to suggest the product doesn&#039;t work, they can abort the study.

So what quality of &quot;evidence&quot; are we really getting?

It isn&#039;t that EBM is a bad principle, it is that the standards for evidence are so distorted by systemic institutional inefficiencies and moral hazards.]]></description>
