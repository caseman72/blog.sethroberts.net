		<description><![CDATA[The study discusses problems seen by trainees, with more incidents seen at the beginning of the school year.  My guess is that incidents would be lower for professionals who have been on the job for years and working under a known and established routine.  But that is speculation.  I don&#039;t know where one finds the information about the number of incidents per hernia operation performed by professionals.  Another useful number would describe the count of threatening incidents per untreated hernia (of the type of hernia you have).

This is not an easy decision.  I had one of those undesirable anesthesia events during my most recent hernia operations and it was alarming.  On the other hand, many years ago I had an emergency hernia operation (diagnosed at 2PM, under the knife at 6PM), and it was bracing to hear later, from a co-worker, that a good friend of hers had died due to an untreated (incarcerated or strangulated) hernia.  

In conclusion, I think you need more information to make your risk management decision.  Unfortunately, I don&#039;t know where you get the information, especially if you body isn&#039;t sending any signals.  Good luck.]]></description>
