Peter (Hyperlipid) posted about gluten-induced hypoperfusion in the brain causing schizophrenia:

The gluten connection has been around for a while, but this is the first I&#039;d heard that it causes (or is associated with) blood flow problems in the brain.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hal, it&#039;s the fact that the National MS Society discourages &lt;strong&gt;testing &lt;/strong&gt;that I find appalling. Treatment (such as lithium) and testing are really different. And the evidence here is far stronger than the ALS case. No one found that lithium levels in ALS patients were always lower than lithium levels in non-ALS patients, which is essentially what has been found here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d suggest it&#039;s reasonable to wait for replication of these results before getting MS patients all worried and clamoring for vein surgery. I have ALS and last year there were encouraging reports (also out of Italy) that lithium had been very effective against that disease. Should the ALS Association have told everybody to rush to their doctors and get lithium? A larger trial was started to replicate the results and was recently stopped midway due to ineffectiveness. Lithium did nothing for ALS in that study.

There are reasons why science does not turn on a dime and change all its recommendations based on the latest result by one scientist. Too many of these reports turn out to be inaccurate or at least incomplete.

I hope very, very strongly that this treatment turns out to be as valuable as claimed and brings great relief to patients with MS. But we need to double check the results before performing this surgery on a large body of people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, yeah, that&#039;s a good question. Judging by everything I&#039;ve read, I cared more than any sleep researcher. No expressions of concern about this. As you say at least a few of them had/have the same problem. Why no expressions of concern?  Why no research program? Well, early awakening isn&#039;t life-threatening. Other sleep disorders are much worse. Maybe because to study early awakening would get in the way of more conventional research that would be more palatable to funding agencies and their colleagues -- but I don&#039;t know. Aside from trying to read people&#039;s minds, I did experiments about the problem for 20 years. Nobody else has done experiments about it for one year. But you also have a good point and I&#039;ve removed the &quot;far&quot; from &quot;far more&quot;. The difference in motivation (between the person with the problem and the average researcher) is really important but I hope I can find a better way to put it.]]></description>
