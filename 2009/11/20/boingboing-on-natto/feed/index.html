		<description><![CDATA[Love natto.....but I don&#039;t use the included the &quot;packets&quot;. They are of the franken foods variety. If you are preparing natto at home add some scallion for extra yum.
FYI, JDL is correct, estrogen not effected by fermentation.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;From what I recall, fermentation doesnâ€™t effect the estrogen effect of soy.&lt;/i&gt;

Awwwww... shit!
Since for other reasons I have to avoid dairy products and replaced yoghurt with lactofermented soy what kind of &lt;b&gt;other&lt;/b&gt; substitute could there be?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Soy has a lot of estrogen in it, so much that I know women who will actively avoid it while on their period because it makes them... &quot;weird,&quot; as they put it.

Excessive estrogen can cause a number of health problems over time. For example, it can cause thyroid dysfunction, increase your appetite, and encourage the development of breast cancer. The information is readily available and I can provide links if you&#039;d like.

After reading the article, perhaps the fermentation process somehow neutralizes the estrogen? This could probably be easily researched.

What do you think, Seth?]]></description>
