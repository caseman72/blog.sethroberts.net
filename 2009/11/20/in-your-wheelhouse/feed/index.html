That said, yes, I knew what the expression was and I&#039;ve seen it in print, on occasion, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard it spoken.]]></description>

And I hear it occasionally in the business world, usually when project assignments are being made in accordance with experience, skills and temperament. Perhaps the phrase has not penetrated the realm of academia.]]></description>
