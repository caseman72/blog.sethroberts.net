		<description><![CDATA[You are confusing freedom with constraints caused by irresponsible use of freedom.  If obesity constrains me, to say that my freedom is reduced as a political statement, you would have to blame some government law for my obesity - a law to the effect that I must eat more calories than I need to maintain a given weight.  It is not enough to say that they have promoted or recommended things that have been ill-advised with respect to health, so long as they don&#039;t force me to abide.  Where&#039;s the law?  

Running water and flushing toilets are great, but man also has higher needs and aspirations, and being denied those by government edict can be particularly gauling, even if those aspirations are not held by your everyday peasant.  China is not very good on that score.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With laws like the patriotic act, political freedom didn&#039;t rose in the US but decreased.

China is governed by engineering and science people while the US is governed by liberal arts folks and one of those groups is able to making better decisions.
It&#039;s no accident that China is better governed. 
You shouldn&#039;t trust people who go to study political science and believe it with political decisions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How much does the existence of companies like Google and Amazon, and the innovation that they drive, contribute to human freedom? Is having an incredible level of accessibility to media and ideas a contribution to human freedom? Could these companies exist in a country governed like China? Is it simply by chance that things like, the internet, Google and Amazon all originate from the same country? How does technological information and increased information affect freedom? 

I think you need to define &quot;freedom&quot; very narrowly if you want to think that freedom is decreasing or stagnant in the US. I think you also need to have a very narrow view of how laws and government affect things in order to pursue this argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How can you say that the existence of the internet has nothing to do with how the US is governed? It did not appear by magic, it is based on a vast infrastructure which had to be built according to state, local and federal laws. It was originally created as part of government research. In many countries the legal system would not support such an endeavor. This is regarding both the physical infrastructure/hardware and the software, both of which are constantly being developed and improved by people with a vast array of skills. It is supported by private industry as well as public research. 

It is not by chance that the internet was created in one country as opposed to another. It could not have been invented in just any country.]]></description>

Freedom in the U.S. has plummeted in recent years, as various police and other agencies are free to eavesdrop secretly on all kinds of communication without a warrant.  Freedom in the U.S. has plummeted in recent years, as it&#039;s much, much easier to monitor, electronically, what people are doing, and where they are, than ever before.
