		<description><![CDATA[[...] CureTogether has found another example of the familiar depression-insomnia correlation.Â  Persons with depression are twice as likely to have insomnia as persons without depression. CureTogether gathered this data much more cheaply than previous studies. Unlike previous researchers, they were under no pressure to publish. (Professional researchers must publish regularly to keep their grants and their job.) Unlike previous researchers, they were under no pressure to follow a party line. On the face of it depression makes you less active. Yet insomnia is a case of being too active. So the depression-insomnia link is far from obvious. Lots of other facts connect depression and circadian rhythms; they all suggest that the intellectual basis of anti-depressants, all that stuff about serotonin and neuro-transmitters and re-uptake, is wrong. If depression is due to messed-up circadian rhythms, taking a drug at random times of day is unlikely to fix the underlying problem. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steven: You must be joking.  Physics is the poster child for fundamental reorderings.  Right now we have two consensus theories that are fundamentally incompatible.

It may be true that in previous temperature swings, CO2 lagged temperature.  What is manifestly true is that &lt;i&gt;this time&lt;/i&gt;, CO2 is leading temperature.  It may be, likewise, that in previous events, CO2 was released from the ocean.  In &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; event, ocean CO2 is radically elevated, to the point that it is killing whole reef ecosystems.  Therefore, this guy is barking up the wrong tree, and has evidently nothing to say about the present crisis -- which crisis it certainly is, whatever the cause.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Patrick, I think you need to study your Latin. 

Anthony, yes. People who believe that the government planted bombs in the WTC are lunatic nutcases who are dead wrong. I don&#039;t care if they have engineering degrees...
Now of course having just said that, I would like to walk back my hyperbole. We all believe the evidence supports various &quot;conspiracies&quot; and I am certain I am someone else&#039;s Lunatic Nutcase.

I think my point here is that it&#039;s good that the New Yorker is rebutting D&amp;L when they go off the tracks. D&amp;L are authorities in their own right who are treated with a certain amount of deference. But in this case they are probably wrong. Global Warming is probably a serious threat and will probably require massive concerted efforts to minimize its damage. Hopefully technology will play a part. But just like that excerpt from the reviewer so eloquently puts it: downplaying the science of global warming while buying whole hog the science of a technological cure for it is a serious lapse in D&amp;L&#039;s judgement. The book reviewer not understanding that the study of nutrition is practiced by people who failed out of dental school has nothing to do with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 
A very interesting and thought-provoking post. Since I don&#039;t have the knowledge, not to mention the credentials, to comment on statistical modeling or climate science, I hesitate to comment. However, as a U.S. citizen, I still have small--too small--say in decision-making about policy decisions regarding climate change. Thus, I have to make a decision about what policies to advocate and support, and more importantly, elected officials from the President on down have to make decisions, so how do they sort it out? 

What I do have some experience about concerns burdens of proof in practical decision-making, as I&#039;m a lawyer, and I try cases. As a lawyer, we never have to prove something absolutely in order to act--or at least the law doesn&#039;t make such a requirement (juries, however, often have ideas of their own). On the subject of climate change, given the magnitude of the perceived  risk, and the prejudice in favor of inaction (carbon-based industrial society does have its charms), it seems to me that the burden has shifted in favor of action. Inaction, if human activity is a significant driver of climate change (rarely is something THE cause), then we have reason to act. This is different from my changing my diet after reading Gary Taubes or Seth Roberts, as I&#039;ve done. If both have valid points, I&#039;m ahead; if not, well, no real harm done, and besides, I like meat and most fermented foods. (Beer counts, too, doesn&#039;t it?). The magnitude of the investment and time to receive feedback in the dietary changes that you advocate are small, and I believe that the limited magnitude of time and risk provides the logic behind many of your ingenious personal experiments: small changes, low risk, quick feedback. 

However, it seems to me that with climate change we don&#039;t have the luxury of long term studies to test predicted outcomes. Of course we have to challenge and test--life, unlike a law case, has no final judgments--but we can&#039;t continually delay action in this type of situation: not to act is to act.

Finally, conventional wisdom may be right, it may be wrong. Social proof is a convenient heuristic for many activities, but for each instance of conventional wisdom we might challenge, we can cite many more that we&#039;d all agree with. Again, it&#039;s a matter of regarding the burdens, testing the evidence, and arguing the inferences. Providing a contrarian view and claiming its validity simply because it is contrarian seems to me a very weak argument indeed. 

Enough. Thanks again for the provocation, and keep up the good work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Socktopi,

Are you familiar with Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth?
http://www.ae911truth.org/

If so, do you believe that the 961 architects and engineers (according to the site) who have signed a petition for Congress to authorize an independent investigation into the collapse of the 3 buildings are all &quot;lunatic nutcases who are dead wrong&quot;?

Curious about your view on this.]]></description>

<p>Are you familiar with Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth?<br />
<a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a></p>
<p>If so, do you believe that the 961 architects and engineers (according to the site) who have signed a petition for Congress to authorize an independent investigation into the collapse of the 3 buildings are all &#8220;lunatic nutcases who are dead wrong&#8221;?</p>
<p>Curious about your view on this.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s get more specific: Were we certain that clorofluorocarbons were causing the ozone hole?  Of course not.  All we had was a preponderance of circumstantial evidence, just as for anthropogenic climate change.  Are we certain now?  No.  What we do know is that it was growing, and we banned CFCs, and now it&#039;s shrinking.

Me, I&#039;m very, very glad we were able to ban CFCs.  A key to quick action was that CFCs were produced in very few places.  CO2 and methane are tougher nuts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me offer a corollary: Are we 100% certain that the twin towers weren&#039;t brought down by explosives? No. The consensus of experts is that there weren&#039;t explosives in the twin towers, but some people disagree; probably some respectable engineer somewhere believes the consensus view is impossible. But most people accept the consensus view even though they aren&#039;t scientists or haven&#039;t studied the matter closely...

Does that mean 9/11 &quot;Truthers&quot; are brave and responsable citizens for questioning people&#039;s blind faith in the consensus that there weren&#039;t explosives in the towers, and their views shouldn&#039;t be ridiculed because scientists don&#039;t understand heart disease? No. 9/11 Truthers are lunatic nutcases who are dead wrong.

Being a sceptic is admirable - EXPERTS ARE OFTEN WRONG. But pick your allies wisely, before you find yourself at a Lyndon Larouche meeting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Look, I&#039;m an economist and I loved Freakanomics, but writing a chapter about how &quot;Global Warming isn&#039;t a big deal, but even if it is, keep driving your Hummer because some day we&#039;ll invent a global cooling machine; Everybody stop freaking out.&quot; is a reckless misdirection of Dubner and Levitt&#039;s talents. Questioning scientific consensus is brave, but what happens when that scientific consensus is correct? We&#039;re pretending that Dubner and Levitt are like Galileo challenging the consensus of our planet&#039;s place in the universe, when they are more akin to creationists challenging the consensus of evolution. Except unlike evolution, if global warming is real, a lot of people are going to die. 95% of the dreaded experts believe it is seriously fuckin&#039; real, and therefore we should make broad and difficult changes in our society. People trust D&amp;L and with good reason, but to then use that credibility to write about fantasies of imminent rain dance technology is disappointing. And it blunts the momentum we need to make difficult changes. D &amp; L are superwrong about this one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last thing, I sent this to Richard at FreetheAnimal.com who was kind enough to post it.  It draws parallels between AGW and Taubes.

http://www.winterspeak.com/2009/10/salute-to-steve-mcintyre.html

&quot;&lt;b&gt;Salute to Steve McIntyre&lt;/b&gt;

In the days of the Royal Society, scientists were hobbyists, pursuing their own whims, pushed to Truth by group norms and the standards of their peers. There was plenty of nonsense then, too (Isaac Newton was an Alchemist) but a small group of individuals, with modest means, got a lot of Science done.

Fast forward to 2009, where science is now big non-business. The nexus between Federal Agencies and science is tight, and scientists produce the results they are paid to produce. Both &quot;Good Calories, Bad Calories&quot; and this expose from Steve McIntyre fit exactly with my own experience in the most prestigeous laboratories on the planet. Don&#039;t believe anything you read in the NYTimes.

My favorite quote:

    In a novel this refusal would have been put down to a deep and deadly conspiracy. What it really concealed was the slipshod data handling, tiny samples, the loss of essential metadata and the careless merging of datasets on which the earlier conclusions were based.

Yup, but they forgot to mention how politically, the wrong answer has become blasphemy. And we think we&#039;ve moved on from Galileo Galilei&#039;s day.&quot;]]></description>

If being skeptical of anthropogenic global warming makes me a loonie, then I wear your slur as a badge of honor.

--

Another way to frame this debate:

1)  We don&#039;t know if global warming is happening

2)  Let&#039;s assume the worst, that it is happening, if it is, we still don&#039;t know that it is anthropogenic in nature.

3)  Again, let&#039;s assume the worst, that it is anthropogenic, we still don&#039;t know if that is on a net basis, bad or good. 

4)  Again, let&#039;s assume the worst, that it is net bad, we still don&#039;t know if we can reverse it. 

5)  This time, let&#039;s assume the best, it is reversible, if it is, we still don&#039;t know if reversing is desirable after factoring costs/benefits. 

My only point:  I don&#039;t know if AGW is occuring or not - it may be - BUT we do know there is a lotta shit we don&#039;t know, but we like to pretend we know on faith.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried to make the same point about the potential that a scientific consensus can nevertheless be highly uncertain to some people around the time an Inconvenient Truth came out.  I am an economist, and economists are good at constructing mathematical models that do precisely what you say - fit the data.  Prediction?  Not so much.  They weren&#039;t scientists, and they simply looked at me like I was insane.  Said nothing.  Very funny.]]></description>
