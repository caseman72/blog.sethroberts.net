		<description><![CDATA[When I eat lots of cow&#039;s milk yogurt, I get allergy symptoms. I&#039;m thinking of trying goat&#039;s milk yogurt instead.  I don&#039;t know what they feed the goats, though.  Are goats in the US kept in feedlots like cows?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How much yogurt/day do I eat? About 500 ml. Fermented for about 20 hours.

Re long life. This is a common observation:

Around 1900, a Russian biologist named Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov hypothesized that regular consumption of yogurt was responsible for the unusually long life spans of Bulgarian peasants.

I found that here:

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if what your friend describes as colds are really allergies; in my early 50s I began getting day or half day &quot;colds&quot; where I would have all of the symptoms of a cold and expect to experience the usual 5 or 6 days of suffering and they would suddenly disappear in a day or less; these were allergies. I could generally not differentiate the symptoms from those of a cold.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, my experience since starting to eat probiotic yogurt 1-2 times per day is somewhat similar. I can&#039;t remember getting actually sick in the last 8 months or so since I started. I can remember various times feeling something coming on, and thinking I was going to get sick, only to be surprised and not. (I have also stopped using an alarm clock during this time, and taking a nap in the afternoon if feeling tired - so, both factors could be at work.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, I forget how I found your blog, but I am experimenting with eating homemade/active yogurt, hoping to boost my immune system.  I&#039;ve had 3 staph infections this year, and chronic eczema - I tried doing the probiotic pills but ditched that in favor of the real stuff.  

Have you found evidence of life extension with eating fermented foods?  I&#039;d be interested in reading about it.

Also, I liked your post about gatekeepers.]]></description>
