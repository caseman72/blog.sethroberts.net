		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got 2 pointers: ketones and BDNF.

Calorie restriction seems to raise your BDNF. BDNF (important for memory) is lowered by sugar, although some researchers indicate it is also lowered by high fat (tests done with high-sugar+high-fat intake), but in the same articles indicate that enough omega-3 fats ARE important...

On a low-carb diet your body switches from the standard glucose-burning, to fat burning (ketosis). Research shows that the heart and brain work 25% more efficiently in ketosis than on glucose burning. Some indicate that a more efficient brain might need a shorter REM sleep, and thus a shorter total sleep time. 

I think Micheal Eades wrote an article on sleep and ketosis, and indicated that some people have sleep problems when doing a low-carb diet, and recommends drinking a cup of tea with sugar just before going to sleep. Your body and brain switches back to (the less efficiently?) glucose burning, and makes it easier to fall asleep. I can&#039;t find the article anymore...

I&#039;m combining SLD with low-carb myself, and it&#039;s great. No/low sugar/carbohydrates when possible, coconutoil in the morning, flaxoil in the evening. Some extra vitamins and fishoil, especially during the weightloss period.
