		<description><![CDATA[user@example.com: Your statement implies the dangerous, indeed fatal, misunderstanding held by a majority of liberals and progressives in the world today.

They somehow see government as being some sort of bulwark against corporate power.

But if you look at the reality, the government is really an extension of corporate power. Money is,. unfortunately, just overwhelmingly more powerful in deciding government policy that popular voice. Government is generally used as the pit bull to justify the use of coercion in achieving the corporate agenda.

Sure, the corporations may cry for their mommy, and say all kinds of nonsense about how oppressed they are. But that is an intentional smokescreen.

This is a case of corporations and government getting together to screw the citizenry, as it is 90+% of the time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;the company doesn&#039;t have a say in this - it&#039;s the politicians making the decision!&quot;

I was upset when I read this story, but now I see that it&#039;s just another example of Big Government and Big Citizen screwing over a poor defenceless company who didn&#039;t even want that land to begin with.  Damn you, Obama!]]></description>
