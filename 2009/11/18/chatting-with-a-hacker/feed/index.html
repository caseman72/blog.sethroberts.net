		<description><![CDATA[No, Twitter is just a convenient and familiar way to demonstrate the exploit.  It works with any SSL connection and login, under certain conditions.  Of course the people using it for ill are not posting articles about how they&#039;re using it.  Probably most uses involve hacking into thousands or millions of wireless routers and altering how they forward SSL traffic, to harvest authentication details.

It&#039;s entirely possible, maybe even likely, that your case was not one of them, and that you got taken by a keylogger installed on a cafe machine, or something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few notes:

- Are you sure they aren&#039;t Chinese? &quot;are want to who you her&quot; - their English is less than perfect.

- The vulnerability you linked to is a flaw in SSL, not in Twitter. Any site using SSL is vulnerable.

- I wouldn&#039;t call this person a hacker, necessarily. Unless you have a much more secure password than average, haven&#039;t ever written it down, and don&#039;t use the same password for any other websites, they could easily have guessed (brute forced against known info) or otherwise found out your password. If not, it was likely a MITM attack, which anyone can do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did you log in using either a cafe computer or someone else&#039;s computer?  I find that people, even sysadmins, can&#039;t be trusted to maintain security.

I try to keep great security on my machines, and rarely use anyone else&#039;s when I&#039;ll need to enter a password.  The one time I know my password was snared was when I was working with a friend on a project &amp; needed to SSH from his terminal, which was logged into the Cal math dept.  When it came to light a day or so later, I initially assumed my friend had unwittingly gotten a keylogger.  In reality, it was the math department that didn&#039;t maintain good security.]]></description>
