		<description><![CDATA[V is a sci-fi show on ABC Tuesday nights. It&#039;s a remake of a mini-series from a couple of decades ago. Aliens come to our planet with the message, &quot;We&#039;re from the government of another planet and we&#039;re here to help you&quot;. They even offer us universal health care. 8-)

White Collar is another one of those &quot;characters welcome&quot; shows on the USA Network. They seem to have a formula for cranking them out - Monk, Psych, Burn Notice, In Plain Sight, Royal Pains. 

You can watch episodes at abc.com and usanetwork.com.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Tom. I hadn&#039;t heard of White Collar and have never seen an episode of V. I also like Entourage, Leverage, Top Chef Masters, American Idol, and The Bachelor/Bachelorette, which are now in hiatus or between seasons.]]></description>
