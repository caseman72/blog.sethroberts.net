		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t dispute fads, frauds, and experimental bias exist in physics. But none of these things seem to have led the field astray for very long. 

I guess I&#039;m less impressed with blogs for uncovering truth than Seth is. Occasionally they seem to dig up an interesting nugget but to me they mostly to act as noise machines. Nor do I understand their popularity, to understand a subject such as dendrochronology and get to the heart of the matter requires a pretty great investment in time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, yeah, Big Oil put its thumb on the scale. And then Al Gore (with far better motives) put his thumb on the scale.

		<description><![CDATA[seth, in discussing global warming, I find it hard to get past the &quot;big oil&quot; funds the opposition and such--and it doesn&#039;t help the most visible opposition is from the Republicans.  Suggestions?

Also, on string theory, another point in the phycisists&#039; favor is that even though string theory overall is (probably) wrong, the research that went into contributed to our sum total of knowledge (whole new areas of math).  Whereas much more of the diet research is simply a waste of time and money I&#039;d say.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom in TX, Ranjit Chandra comes to mind. There are many examples. Ronald Fisher, the famous statistician, argued for years that smoking didn&#039;t cause cancer. So did Hans Eysenck, a famous psychologist. Cyril Burt, a famous psychologist, fabricated data. 

If I had to pick the greatest &quot;scam&quot; (= the public is misled) since 1900, I don&#039;t think we have a winner yet but I think it will turn out to be either (a) animal fat is bad for us or (b) humans are causing dangerous global warming.

		<description><![CDATA[Jason Says: &quot;... string theorists were getting most of the grant money and positions and publications...&quot;

That brings up a good point. I don&#039;t see why &quot;consensus&quot; should be the standard here. Can we think of examples where scientists got lots of grant money, prestigious positions, and high salaries, and then were shown to be completely wrong? That tells more about how the layman is being scammed by the (bad) scientists.]]></description>

Excellent point regarding consensus. One quibble: &quot;The latter groupâ€™s â€œconsensusâ€ with whatever the first group is doing is not meaningful and adds no extra weight to it IMHO.&quot;

With one exception. The consensus view on diet (carbohydrates, especially grains = good, fat, especially from animals = bad) has added a lot of extra weight. But only to people&#039;s waistlines, not to nutritional science. ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Physics has a generally more consistent pattern of getting things mostly right, then either fine-tuning or generalizing.

Newton was right, and still is, but it turns out his laws of motion are a special case when Einstein generalized our understanding of nature..

The earth was flat, and still is. It&#039;s just locally flat. We generalized our knowledge to say it&#039;s a sphere. Then we fine-tuned our knowledge -- it&#039;s not really a sphere, but an oblong ellipsoid. We fine-tune further: it&#039;s not a perfect ellipsoid, the southern hemisphere as a slightly larger bulge than the northern.

If our knowledge of the topology of the earth worked the same way it does in medicine, psychology, economics, or other psueodosciences, then one moment we&#039;d think the earth is round, then the next it&#039;s a cube, then a donut, then a Klein Bottle, then a dodecahedron.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

The third example is unfair.  Modern physics properly dates from Newton, the guy who demonstrated that you can explain the world with math.  Indeed, it&#039;s probably fair to suggest that the dawning of the scientific age was marked by Newton.  But regardless, talking physics pre-Newtonian revolution isn&#039;t fair.  I&#039;m not convinced that phlogiston works well either, even though that&#039;s the immediate post-Newton response.  But that&#039;s at least harder to disqualify.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We don&#039;t have many examples of physics work that has entered the political arena.  This is one thing I think is different about climate modeling.  It is influenced by political pressure, or at least all the attention. 

The other thing I would emphasize is that this concept people have of &quot;consensus&quot; among All Physicists or All Scientists is something of an illusion.  There are a fraction of scientists who do real climate science and modeling.  The others &lt;i&gt;do not&lt;/i&gt; and (unless they take an interest in the subject, and roll up their sleeves..) for the most part will only have the vaguest idea what the former are talking about.  The latter group&#039;s &quot;consensus&quot; with whatever the first group is doing is not meaningful and adds no extra weight to it IMHO.  It probably does mean there have been no obvious mistakes that can be easily spotted at a glance by sharp minds, which is something, but as a practical matter it is unlikely that, say, the average high-energy physicist working on superfluids has sat down and thoroughly studied and evaluated a survey of the models, assumptions and data used to simulate the Kuroshio current.  At most he maybe skims a paper or (maybe) is at a conference where some of the talks are about climate, and goes &quot;uh huh&quot; or &quot;okay, I guess&quot;.

If he&#039;s politically interested in the issue, or trusts or is friends with the scientist doing the work, he may add his name to a public letter of some sort.  The resulting tally seems to be what people call consensus - so we have maybe several dozen people doing actual work at the forefront, thousands of other scientists going &quot;uh huh&quot;, and we call it a Scientific Consensus and are very impressed.  To me this is the real problem with the concept.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We don&#8217;t have many examples of physics work that has entered the political arena.  This is one thing I think is different about climate modeling.  It is influenced by political pressure, or at least all the attention. </p>
