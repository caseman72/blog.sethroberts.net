		<description><![CDATA[I like to categorize this as &quot;binary&quot; thinking. There is also linear, numbers based thinking and qualitative thinking. Something like JS Mill&#039;s Utilitarianism is the classic idea of &quot;numbers based&quot; thinking, which basically dilutes the entire human experience to a math equation. The problem is that it&#039;s never that simple. You can never dilute your life to a yes/no question or even a numerical question. I like to say that rather than thinking in numbers or yes/no, we think in terms of colors.

New Age, but also some flavors of Buddhism and Taoism are two examples I can give of &quot;color based&quot; religions that aren&#039;t black and white.]]></description>
