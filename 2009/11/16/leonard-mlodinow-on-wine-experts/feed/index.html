If the framing effects really do make a wine better--I think Tyler Cowen argued for the possibility framing effects might add to real enjoyment--then perhaps you can use this effect to make your life better.  You buy some cheap liquor and expensive liquor, pour them into identical, nice-looking bottles, and mix them up so you don&#039;t know by look which bottle is expensive and which is cheap.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Or similar to Amazon&#039;s book ratings. Such ratings could be very valuable, but they&#039;re also very hackable currently, as fake ratings can be added by people with vested interests, and often they are quite highly incentivzed to do so. What is needed is for &quot;real name&quot; systems to become more common and acceptable, so people have to provide some evidence of who they are -- say a credit card -- in order to create an account. I think we&#039;ll see such verification techniques become more common as digital natives age and constitute a greater proportion of the population, using the net more and more naturally.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

I thought this was a good prescription from that article:

&quot;If you ignore the web of medals and ratings, how do you decide where to spend your money?

One answer would be to do more experimenting, and to be more price-sensitive, refusing to pay for medals and ratings points.&quot;

We each are &quot;experts&quot; in our own taste preferences: self-experiment away.

And maybe use the heuristic that the average price per bottle never exceed $10 in these experiments.

I suspect the health benefits from wine accrue via hormesis.

Intake becomes toxic at some point, I imagine, and I suspect that level is lower than we think.

Cheers,

Brent]]></description>
