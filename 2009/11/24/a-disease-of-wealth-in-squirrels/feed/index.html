		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. Or those working the graveyard shift get significantly less sunlight and therefore vitamin D which is also correlated (maybe causally related) to cancer. Though I don&#039;t know how much vitamin D sun exposure in Denmark will produce. If it is a good source, it will only be during the summer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even cancer may be linked to abnormal circadian rhythms:

&quot;A nationwide study in Denmark, for example, found that women who work mainly at night for at least six months are 1.5 times more likely to develop breast cancer than those who work regular hours (8). Researchers suggest that the raised cancer risk could be because these peopleâ€™s cells start to divide at the wrong time and run amok, an idea supported by some cell-culture studies.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Just goes to show that science won&#039;t always provide immediate conclusions for a simple manipulation. Sometimes what&#039;s important is the interaction between the manipulation and the diversity of environments in which the manipulation can be expressed (checked). Our causal models usually start out simple (Cause--&gt;Effect), but reality is often much more complex and therefore more subtle (Cause1+Cause2--&gt;Effect, or Cause1--&gt;Effect iff Cause2 is equal to or greater than some threshold value, etc.).
