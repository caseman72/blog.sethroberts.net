		<description><![CDATA[I make my own yogurt using the yogourmet yogurt maker and starter.  I normally ferment mine for 24 hours but last time I forgot about it and it fermented for 32 hours.  The consistency and taste is great but I&#039;m worried that I may have killed the probiotics in the yogurt and it won&#039;t &quot;work&quot; anymore.  Do you have any info on this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Try adding 2 T. of honey and 2 T. of vanilla to a quart of milk before bringing it to a boil, it makes the best yogurt. I taught at Head Start and every 6 weeks got strep throat. After eating 2 cups of yogurt a day, I no longer got strep throat, even though I was exposed to it constantly.
The older Salton makers with the 5 cups servings are great, you can find them at thrift stores and yard sales for about $2, so keep looking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Help,
I made whey and curds for the first time.  I used organic milk from an aseptic carton and it would not separate in the home, which was very cool.  I placed it in my car in a chest on a few warm days and it separated.  I placed the separated mixture in the refrigerator without draining.  The mixture had no odor, but both the curds and whey taste bitter.  I don&#039;t know what either should taste like. Should I toss and start over? Is is useful for purposes other than consumption.

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Recently began making my own home made yogurt and tried your suggestion putting it in soup - excellent!

One question - my dad told me that doing this means I&quot;m killing off all that bacteria I have carefully grown and kept alive in my yogurt. To test this, I used a meat thermometer to check my soup temp and it&#039;s about 140 degrees when I eat it. I assume this means I am killing off all my probiotics. Is that a concern of yours at all, whether putting it in the soup is killing off the bacteria and nullifying some (if not all) of the effects ? =)

I am a beginner to this, still learning, so I&#039;m not looking to criticize - I&#039;m looking to learn more information, and that&#039;s why I&#039;m asking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been playing around with yogurt making recently, using a few diffrent high end plain yogurts as a starter. They don&quot;t have any problem getting thick enough without any added powdered milk, but they are milder in flavor than what I started with. Cook times have been 8 hours &amp; 12 hrs. I boiled the milk first, thinking it was a sterility issue. The batch I&#039;m working on now I just got hot, so will see. Sure is fun, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your response and for your additional info about your method. I understand you to be saying that the powdered milk is to boost the bacteria, not to add body.

But now the question is: Is it a good tradeoff to add an ingredient that can potentially hurt you, in order to increase the amount of a beneficial ingredient? I am eager to learn your thoughts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the warning about damaged cholesterol. Left out of your calculations is this: The powdered milk contains lactose. The bacteria need lactose. More lactose, more bacteria. Which is the whole point -- getting a lot of bacteria.

I get my starter from my previous batches of yogurt. How much body and oomph my yogurt has depends heavily on how long I preheat it and how long I let it incubate. I can get plenty of both if I preheat it long enough and let it incubate long enough.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing that worries me, for your sake, is your inclusion of powdered milk. That potentially offsets the benefits of the great bacteria in your homemade yogurt with the hazards of oxidized cholesterol I suggest a search for &quot;damaged cholesterol powdered milk&quot; to look into what has been said about this.

Most commercial yogurts (also nonfat and low-fat dairy products) contain powdered milk (it is not required to be listed separately from the fluid milk on the label) for added body. It is one way commercial yogurt makers get the stiff body that Americans are used to in yogurt. This consistency is not typical of European yogurt, which is more of a thick drink rather than a spoonable custard. The natural, &quot;Greek-style&quot; yogurt I&#039;ve seen gets its thickness by being strained of some of its whey. (Tasty, but on the other hand, the whey is also good for you.

Have you considered using a dry starter culture rather than starting with commercial, prepared yogurt? These are available at some natural food stores and online through places like New England Cheesemaking. I haven&#039;t used it, but supposedly it makes homemade yogurt with a lot more body and general oomph than using prepared yogurt does.

I&#039;m curious as to your thoughts on this.]]></description>

Yeast extract (marmite/vegemite, for example), miso, and vegetable krauts are all fermented foods with bitter undertones, while kombucha and rejuvelac (raw, fermented, sprouted grain drinks) are two fermented, nonalcoholic drinks that come to mind. Most acidophilus cultures also tend to be bitter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bacteria IS good for you. Itâ€™s just a few select nasties and human/animal borne germs that are bad for you. 

Iâ€™d also like to suggest that environment can also turn friendly bacteria into a killer. E-Coli is a great example. It naturally exists in your colon and serves a very important purpose there, but can kill you if it gets in the wrong location. One of the primary reasons (if not THE primary reason) why coat hanger abortions are so dangerous is because a womanâ€™s uterine wall is extremely close to the large intestine. A coat hanger is usually straight, while the uterus is not. If you puncture that wall, you expose your reproductive system to normally harmless bacteria that will set up shop in a place they shouldnâ€™t and kill you. Similarly, your E-Coli may be your best friend, but your best friend&#039;s E-Coli could be your worst enemy and kill you.

In college (UC Davis), I remember taking a class called the History of Infectious Diseases where the benefits of bacteria, but also the detriments of living in an environment absent of bacteria, were discussed. A lot of the problems we have with diseases could be avoided by changing our attitude toward bacteria. Although it is probably a necessary evil, antibiotic-resistant, flesh eating Staph infections (a normally harmless bacteria) thrive in hospitals because they are often overly-sterile environments.

Most interestingly, however, a constant, low-level exposure to bacteria can be a tremendous benefit to your immune system. That yogurt youâ€™re eating doesnâ€™t just contain bacteria, but is a microscopic ecosystem in-and-of-itself. It also often contains harmless (to us) viruses that live off of that bacteria, called bacteriophages. By eating yogurt, you not only strengthen your immune system, you provide your gut and oral cavity with a nice supply of bacteria predators that, unlike antibiotics, will adapt to the bacteria as it changes genetically.

I canâ€™t help but think that we evolved to take advantage of this. My theory is that this is what the bitter palate is for. Itâ€™s essentially our â€œbacteria detector/regulator.â€ Fermented foods are often bitter. We naturally like bitter foods. Theyâ€™re a unique taste and, I think, fascinate our palate. We find them interesting and fun. But our palate can only take so much, so we must enjoy bitterness in moderation. This encourages us to ingest bacteria without having too much. 

Of course, Iâ€™m not encouraging us all to eat filthy food, but amusingly, at the end of our last lecture, our professor said â€œOK guys, now whatâ€™s the moral of the story? The next time you drop your sandwich on the floor, wait a few minutes before picking it up.â€]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bacteria IS good for you. Itâ€™s just a few select nasties and human/animal borne germs that are bad for you. </p>
<p>Iâ€™d also like to suggest that environment can also turn friendly bacteria into a killer. E-Coli is a great example. It naturally exists in your colon and serves a very important purpose there, but can kill you if it gets in the wrong location. One of the primary reasons (if not THE primary reason) why coat hanger abortions are so dangerous is because a womanâ€™s uterine wall is extremely close to the large intestine. A coat hanger is usually straight, while the uterus is not. If you puncture that wall, you expose your reproductive system to normally harmless bacteria that will set up shop in a place they shouldnâ€™t and kill you. Similarly, your E-Coli may be your best friend, but your best friend&#8217;s E-Coli could be your worst enemy and kill you.</p>

you can see that mustard has too much omega-6 to be a good source of omega-3. Anyway, I don&#039;t think mustard is a significant source of omega-3 in anyone&#039;s diet; we eat it in tiny amounts. I&#039;m not saying mustard is bad; I&#039;m saying strong yogurt is much better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love (soy) yogurt, but what&#039;s with the mustard-hatred? Mustard is made from Brassica seeds and often colored with turmeric. Like many seeds (flax et all), it&#039;s a great tasting source of Omega fats. It probably aids digestion and is thought to increase metabolism. The seeds have been used medicinally since Hippocrates, and are mentioned in the New Testament. How is good yogurt a substitute for mustard? I could see it as a substitute for mayonnaise - (all right-thinking people agree mayonnaise is gross). But no-one is going to put yogurt on their tofu-dog.]]></description>
