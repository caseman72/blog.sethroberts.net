		<description><![CDATA[Mlodinow&#039;s error is in the last phrase of the sentence in the second full paragraph on p. 113: &quot;That leaves us with just (boy, girl-F), (girl-F, boy), (girl-NF, girl-F), and (girl-F, girl-NF), which are, to a very good approximation, equally likely.&quot; In fact, the odds for (B, GF) and (GF, B) are 1/3 each, while the odds for (GNF,GF) and (GF, GNF) are 1/6 each. Let&#039;s look at it step-by-step.
First, we are told that a woman is pregnant with fraternal twins. There are four equally likely outcomes: (B,B), (B,G), (G,B), and (G,G). So the odds that both twins are girls is 1/4.
Second, we are told that at least one of the twins is a girl. There are now three equally likely outcomes: (B,G), (G,B), and (G,G). So the odds that both twins are girls is 1/3.
Third, we are told that some girls are named Florida, but we don&#039;t yet know how many girls are so named. Let&#039;s assume for a moment that half of all girls are named Florida. (B,G) thus has two equally likely outcomes: (B,GF) and (B,GNF). Each is thus 50% of 1/3, or 1/6 likely. Similarly, (G,B) has two equally likely outcomes, (GF,B) and (GNF,B), each of which has a 50% of 1/3, or 1/6 chance of happening. (G,G) has four equally likely outcomes, (GF,GF), (GF,GNF), (GNF,GF), and (GNF,GNF), each of which is 25% of 1/3, or 1/12 likely to occur.
Fourth, we are told that at least one of the twins is a girl named Florida. (B,G) can thus only be (B,GF) and has a 1/3 chance of being the outcome. Similarly,(G,B) can only be (GF,B), and has a 1/3 chance of being the outcome. (G,G) can thus only be (GF,GF), (GF,GNF), or (GNF,GF), each of which has a 33% of 1/3, or 1/9 chance of happening.
Finally, we are told that Florida is a very rare name, and nobody (except maybe George Foreman) is going to name both twin girls Florida. So, (G,G) can now be only (GF,GNF) or (GNF,GF) each of which has a 50% of 1/3, or 1/6, chance of happening. The 1/3 chance that both twins are girls has not changed because of any additional information. Simple, eh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remain in the camp that believes the explanation to this problem is wrong!!!!  Here is my analagous problem.  Imagine sex is determined by casting a die.  Odd is girl, even is boy.

Q:  What is the probability that a pair of dice thrown will result in two odd numbers if at least one lands on an odd number?

A:  1/3

Now imagine a 1000-sided die.  Let the number 999 represent the name Florida.

Q:  What is the probability that a pair of dice thrown will result in two odd numbers if at least one lands on the number 999?

A:  999 / 1999.  To see this, draw a table with x = 1 to 1000 on the horizontal axis and y = 1 to 1000 on the vertical axis.  Now just count down the column 999 and across the row 999, and add up the outcomes representing the intersection of two odd numbers.


As faces of the die are removed (representing the increasing popularity of the name), the probability slowly approaches the limit 1/3.  But of course, no name occurs with frequency 0.5, so any time a name is given, the probability is much closer to 1/2 than it is to 1/3.

This is where Mlodinow went wrong.  He explains that the fact that Florida is a rare name is the key to this problem when in fact you get essentially the same result even with the most popular name in the U.S.

Even the most popular names for children occur with a frequency of about 1 in 150 to 1 in 170 (ignoring sex).  So let&#039;s say you have a 170-sided die.  Even numbers represent boys, odd represent girls, and the number 169 represents the name Emma which was the most popular girls name in the U.S. in 2008.  What are the odds that a family with two children has two girls, if one of their children is named Emma.  (I&#039;m ignoring the possibility of boys named Emma).  The answer is 119/339 or very close to 1/2.

So the relative popularity of a particular name is somewhat irrelevant.  The real reason for the dramatic difference between the two problems (the one resulting in probability 1/3 and the one approximating 1/2) is that the basic building blocks of the sample has changed.  Instead of a sample consisting of families, when a name is given to a particular child we are now looking at a sample consisting of individual children.  So the frequency of girls is always about one half, but the frequency of two-children families with girls is about 3/4.  When the families with two children are looked at more closely, we see that 2/3 have one girl and 1/3 have two girls, but this fact tells us something about the distribution of characteristics among families, not among girls.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting on numbers and such.

BTW, a segue back to your Taubes series ...

&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s &quot;Do We Really Know What Makes Us Healthy?&quot;, by Gary Taubes, all about the problems built into epidemiological studies, and it&#039;s online at
http://crab.rutgers.edu/~mbravo/prospective.pdf . It&#039;s fourteen pages long, and worth every minute of the time it takes to read it, in my opinion. Here&#039;s one brief sample:&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&quot;Smoking and lung cancer is the emblematic success story of chronic-disease epidemiology. But lung cancer was a rare disease before cigarettes became widespread, and the association between smoking and lung cancer was striking: heavy smokers had a 2,000 to 3,000 percent the risk of those who had never smoked. This made smoking a &#039;turkey shoot,&#039; says Greenland of U.C.L.A., compared with the associations epidemiologists have struggled with ever since, which fall into the tens of a percent range. The good news is that such small associations, even if causal, can be considered relatively meaningless for a single individual.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Taubes devotes a lot of space, usefully, to the problem of &quot;healthy-user bias&quot; -- the fact that people &quot;who faithfully engage in activities that are good for them -- taking a drug as prescribed, for instance, or eating what they believe is a healthy diet -- are fundamentally different from those who don&#039;t.&quot; So, for example, there was the Coronary Drug Project, which found that not only did those who took their prescribed drugs faithfully cut their risk of heart-disease almost by half, this was also true of those who took their placebo faithfully.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Also online is Sue Hughes&#039; two-page summary of the Taubes article, titled &quot;New York Times Magazine focuses on pitfalls of epidemiological trials,&quot; at
http://www.theheart.org/article/813719.do . &lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
