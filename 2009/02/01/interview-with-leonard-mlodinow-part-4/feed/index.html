		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I hate to keep bugging you on this, but . . . when you say, &quot;Your books give the impression that they want to be entertainingâ€“the author, you, is trying to meet the reader halfway. . . . A lot of people who are very serious about their topic have a hard time seeing why you need to make it interesting,&quot;  I think you&#039;re completely missing the point.  Everybody wants to make their writing interesting and readable; it&#039;s just hard to do!  As you and Mlodinow discuss, practice is important, talent is important, putting in the time is important.  But it&#039;s not like people are writing badly on purpose!]]></description>
