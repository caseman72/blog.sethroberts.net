		<description><![CDATA[[...] As previously blogged, the evolutionary reason we like umami taste may be so that we&#8217;ll eat more bacteria-laden food. This makes sense only if bacteria-laden food would have been the main source of umami. Nowadays, you can get umami from MSG. What about before MSG? [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suspect that that human preferences were fairly well optimized to guide pre-civilization humans toward good health. If humans need Y for optimal health, we would expect natural selection to have developed preferences that led to sufficient Y intake.

One such preference might be a taste for Y, itself.  Given that Y might be expensive for the body to measure directly, however, selection-based optimization would likely have found some easy-to-measure X to serve as a reliable marker for Y.  If you consider a similar optimization process to have been performed for all the myriad Ys that our bodies need, it&#039;s reasonable to conclude that we humans crave a lot of related Xs as a result.

Fast forward to today.   With agriculture, we have introduced many &quot;new&quot; foods, some of which do not preserve the traditional X-and-Y relationships our pre-civilization bodies expect.  Further, with modern food science, we can figure out what any particular X is, manufacture it in isolation, and sprinkle it into all sorts of unrelated foods.  All of a sudden, those foods become a whole lot more crave-worthy, but our bodies&#039; natural preferences become a whole lot less reliable (or a whole lot more manipulable, depending on your cynicism level).

It&#039;s an interesting situation, this X for Y thing, one that raises some fascinating research questions.  For example, can market research lead us to better eating?  Go to the supermarket, buy popular junk food, and examine the ingredients for possible X markers.  If we consider those Xs to be the most-strongly craved (as revealed by marketing and sales optimization), they might point to the Ys we most strongly need.  For each potential X, figure out what Y it indicated in pre-civilization times, and eat more of that.

That&#039;s interesting stuff. I think you&#039;re on to something here, Seth.]]></description>
