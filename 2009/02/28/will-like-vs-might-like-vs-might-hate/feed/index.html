		<description><![CDATA[Metacritic shows you the rating for every review, in addition to the average rating.  You can see, for instance, that Gran Torino (average rating 72 out of 100) didn&#039;t get any ratings over 91 from the 34 reviews, while Benjamin Button (average = 70) got seven 100&#039;s.  They also have user ratings, which could be more informative than reviewer ratings, but it&#039;s harder to get a sense of their distribution because there are more of them and they aren&#039;t organized as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Seth Roberts puts it a different way (speaking in the context of health and medical treatments). If there is time to administer only one treatment, then we probably do want the treatment most likely to help. But if there are many treatments available and there is time to administer more than one treatment â€” if the first one fails, try another, and so on â€” then it is not nearly so obvious that we want the treatment with the best mean score. Given big differences from person to person, we might want to know what treatments worked really well with someone. Conversely, if we are studying side effects, we might want to know which of two treatments was more likely to have extremely bad outcomes. We would certainly prefer a summary like the minimum (worst) to a summary like the median or mean. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

What you are describing for the movies is what is known as recommender systems. They are a huge interest in the machine learning community. One of the prime example being the current netflix competition (http://www.netflixprize.com/ ) where the best minds can do better than 10% of the original netflix:

A transfer into the treatment process is a very interesting idea.
