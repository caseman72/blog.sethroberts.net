		<description><![CDATA[when I made mine, I brought the milk to just barely boiling, then let it cool on the stove to 120Â° which I measured with my candy thermometer, then mixed in my starter.
I got some liquid on top after fermenting for about 7-8 hours, which my recipe said was whey.  I just stirred it back in, but the recipe said drain and save for other uses.   All of the recipes I looked at said to barely boil the milk and turn off right when it starts to bubble.
I wonder if these recipes aren&#039;t from back when milk was fresh from the cow, not the store.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the milk got over 200 degrees.

Heating to such high temperatures is believed to kill, not increase,  bacteria. On the other hand the two sets were not at exactly the same temperature when I added the starter -- the heated one was about 10 degrees warmer -- so that might have increased the bacteria in the preheated one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting about the experiment. Do you have an idea about the temperature the milk reached after 20 minutes? I usually heat the milk until it reaches close to 200 degrees. I&#039;&#039;m wondering if heating it to 120 degrees would be enough. My understanding is that that 115-120 is the temperature that allows the bacteria to reproduce faster. My guess was that your watery yogurt (at room temperature) just didn&#039;t have enough bacteria, although it should have been less bitter than the solid ones if true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In case you need/want more ideas/recipes for fermented foods, this is a book I was given by a chef in the family. For a &quot;cookbook&quot; it has a fair amount of additional information about fermentation and live-culture foods.
