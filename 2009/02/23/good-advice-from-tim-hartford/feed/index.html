		<description><![CDATA[I shudder just thinking about this. Roughly once a month, I succumb to temptation and buy a pair of lottery tickets. $20 a year is a bargain for the chance to speculate what I&#039;ll do with my winnings. Playing the lottery without the ticket? Sheer terror.

Re purchasing a product first: not sure how it&#039;s related. After all, aren&#039;t you just as likely to purchase product A, discover it&#039;s a piece of crap, and then get pissed off every time you see a commercial for it?

Conversely, I get enormous satisfaction from targeted advertising that actually offers me services and products I find valuable. For instance, a number of top tech blogs so consistently feature useful advertisers, I&#039;ll browse the ads intentionally. Similarly, but to a lesser degree, the advertisers on HARO have become the main reason I open Shankman&#039;s daily emails.]]></description>
