		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I like the respect that you show for the point of view of others. In my own drive to keep growing, to keep learning, Iâ€™ve learned that a closed mind is great at action, but not at listening. An open mind leaves a chance for someone to drop a worthwhile idea in it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, maybe it&#039;s a certain kind of moralizing I don&#039;t like. I agree with you that it is actually a good thing to say this is good and that is bad, as you often do in your blog. But saying it in a way that implies that anyone who disagrees with you is a bad person or stupid or something like that -- that I don&#039;t like and think is unhelpful. The black and white aspect comes into it with false certainty: The statement is too strong as if the issue is really clear when it isn&#039;t. As if there is less room for disagreement than there actually is.

For example, to say a certain graph is bad for reasons X, Y, and Z -- that&#039;s fine. That&#039;s really helpful. But to say a certain graph is &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; -- as you have never done, as far as I know -- isn&#039;t helpful at all. It implies that there are black-and-white rules about making graphs. That&#039;s an unhelpful implication because making graphs is too complicated for that. Statements like that discourage thinking and encourage blind obedience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know that moralizing is so bad.  Your blog is full of moralizing--and I mean that in a good way.  As for Casnocha&#039;s comment:  he seems to have a different economic philosophy than the person who wrote the passage that he criticizes.  But this seems more like a difference of perspective.  Casnocha is moralizing too (which isn&#039;t a bad thing).

P.S.  The fermented food thing is interesting too, but too far from any of my expertise to comment on.  I&#039;m glad you&#039;re stirring things up in this field.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Doesn&#039;t salt have anti-biotic properties--meat used to be preserved by being salted rather than frozen.  Does the intersection of salt and fermentation do anything special, I wonder?  Salt and fermentation seem at cross purposes to an extent.  Does the salt kill or weaken bad bacteria from fermentation and allow your immune system to sample it, producing a process like vaccination which uses destroyed viruses?]]></description>
