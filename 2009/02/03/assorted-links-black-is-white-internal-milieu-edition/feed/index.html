		<description><![CDATA[[...] In writing a preliminary version of this to a friend, they asked if I was concerned about acid rain. Eh, not so much. Even if I were, I think that it&#8217;d also be a problem for my city water source, because acid rain frees heavy metals from the soil and Alto Pass water comes from a big pond. In any case, I&#8217;m going to include a little bit of limestone in the water to make it a little more basic, because acidic water tends to have more soluble heavy metals and pesticides. As mentioned above, I may also have to add a little bit of chlorine to my water to kill any bacteria in it, but I&#8217;m going to wait on that. I want to test the water first and not introduce chlorine if I don&#8217;t have to. Or I may just rely on the hygiene hypothesis&#8230; [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I&#039;m personally a big fan of fermented food taste/cost-wise, you do need to be careful before you chomp down all the fermented chinese goodies.

In Japan, Korea, China and India, the incidence of stomach cancer is fare higher than in the west.  When Asians move to the US, their stomach cancer rates also drop (although heart disease rises).  Some claim that this is due to fermented food or pickled foods.  Some links:

I happen to live in Japan and eat lots of Natto.  The health care system does accommodate for this though.  Almost everyone over 30 gets a stomach ultrasound annually and barium esophageal/stomach scans every other year.  In the US, men only get ultrasounds if they&#039;re about to go on Oprah to talk about their baby.]]></description>
