		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for asking, Seth, and for these interviews. This particular book is definitely on my reading list-- although I&#039;ve studied probability theory I really want to learn how to explain notoriously &quot;difficult&quot; things to people without intimidating them. I&#039;ve actually gotten worse at this over the years (a growing, nerdy tendancy to confuse precision and clarity?)

Any coincidental parallels aside I do recommend &quot;Lottery&quot;, and just about anything by Borges. :)]]></description>

A good writer (or self-experimenter) learns that it&#039;s OK to invest in seemingly wild and embarrassing ideas because the world lets him know they are not wild and embarrassing after all.]]></description>
