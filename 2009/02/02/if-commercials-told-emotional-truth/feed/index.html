		<description><![CDATA[Just saying hi. I watched the commercial just now and loved it, and happened on your blog while googling Carl&#039;s name.  
Looking forward to doing some blog digging here!

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of TJ, those &quot;&lt;b&gt;Airborne&lt;/b&gt;&quot; things featured in the video clip are a scam.  

The company was obliged to pay out $millions, for fraud.  The studies they cited on the label to support their claims turned out to be made up from whole cloth by the company founder.  There&#039;s probably nothing wrong with whatever it says is in there, although it&#039;s probably nothing you don&#039;t get otherwise anyway. Given that the founder is a proven crook, there&#039;s every reason to guess that what the label says doesn&#039;t match the contents, if it would cost anything to keep them aligned.

I don&#039;t know why TJ continues to stock them.

What I really wonder about is the Buffalo Mozzarella.  I hated giving that up, but how can we find out how much dioxin is in there?]]></description>
