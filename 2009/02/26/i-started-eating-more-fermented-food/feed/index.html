		<description><![CDATA[While I can&#039;t attest for sure to the exact cause, I do get the same &quot;clean as a whistle&quot; effect from, I believe, organic brown rice. Now I know how dogs feel when -- after taking care of business -- they scratch the dirt, then trot off all frisky-like.

It seems to me that this is the way Nature intended it. She&#039;s not known for inelegant designs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder about consuming lots of the same thing over time. I started eating yogurt (with live bacteria...White Mountain Bulgarian) and noticed improvements in my ability to digest dairy. I was eating a quart a week, perhaps too much, especially given my sensitivity to dairy. After a few months, I started developing a rash. It occurred to me that the new element in my diet was the yogurt, so I stopped and the rash started to subside. I&#039;ll give it a little longer and will probably start eating yogurt again with a little more moderation. I may also try rotating various fermented foods.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve noticed generally the same effects after incorporating goat-milk kefir, yogurt, and raw-milk cheeses into my daily diet. I also tend to feel less sleepy at night time. I used to feel the need to turn the light out and go to sleep by about 10:30pm and wake up at around 6:30-7:15am (I don&#039;t use an alarm clock; I just let myself naturally awaken). Since I started using the lactofermented foods, I find I don&#039;t feel sleepy enough to go to sleep until between 11-11:30pm, but I still wake up at about the same time and feel refreshed and rested (usually, since my 6-month old still sleeps in our room, I&#039;m sometimes awakened at 2-3am by her and have difficulty falling back to sleep afterward). Let&#039;s just say that babies are NOT conducive to regular peaceful sleep!]]></description>
