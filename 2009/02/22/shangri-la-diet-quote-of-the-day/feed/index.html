		<description><![CDATA[Hi!
I read your book a few years ago and loved it.  It really helped my appetite, but it made me sick (the sugar and/or the oil).  I read somewhere else that protein powder mixed with a 3-4 cups water does the same thing (you have to sip it for an hour--not gulp it down--starting an hour after your last meal and you can&#039;t eat for an hour after you stop drinking it).  I bought one that has stevia as the sweetener because I don&#039;t like artificial sweeteners.  

Anyway, the only reason I tried it was because I had read your book and it made sense.  Oh my goodness!! I am so happy!  My appetite is GONE (just like when I drank the oil or sugar) but I don&#039;t feel sick.  It seems like you mentioned in your book that you were going to try egg whites.  Did you ever try?  I wonder if protein isolate by itself would work.

I HATE being hungry all the time, so thanks so much for your great discovery.  Even if I don&#039;t lose weight, I would still do it because I like the feeling of control.  

P.S.  I love your comments about fermented food.  Have you ever tried Cortido?  It is a Mexican Sauerkraut.  I got the recipe from one of my favorite books--Nourishing Traditions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

I have just started the SLD and am starting to notice my reduced hunger, especially in the evenings. I was wondering if you have heard of anyone coming off antidepressants like myself have been able to lose weight (its so damn hard normally).
Thanks :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ha! That&#039;s my quote. :) I meant every word. Except, maybe, for the ground-up kitty cat part. It really has been fantastic, though. Thanks, Seth!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth! I&#039;m one of the people who started everyone talking about your diet plan at the &quot;I Hate My Message Board&quot; boards. We&#039;ve got several people trying it, and two people blogging about their experiences now. Stay tuned and keep reading over there! 

It&#039;s been two weeks now and I&#039;m still doing well - 9 lbs. down, thus far. Thanks so much for your book!]]></description>
