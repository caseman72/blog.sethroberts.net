		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

In addition to the confirmation bias that Patrick and Dr. Gelman talk about, it&#039;s very clear that you are very, very quick to generalize your results to the broader population. Your results may be far less applicable outside your own body than you think. 

You do provoke me to think though. And for that I&#039;m grateful. .]]></description>

I agree.

Ironic given Seth&#039;s statistical training.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

You&#039;re a great guy, but sometimes you say things that are just ridiculous, and this is one of them.  Not everything in life has to fit your theory.  I hope that, having talked to some parents about what foods kids like--which I&#039;m pretty sure will convince you that you&#039;re way way wrong on this one--you&#039;ll think back on many of the other events that have appeared to you to be confirming examples of your theory.

That said, perhaps it&#039;s not so horrible that you are too credulous about your own theories.  This credulity motivates you to take the theories more seriously, which motivates you to try to test them.  And you are certainly willing to accept contrary evidence and change your beliefs, if the evidence is strong enough.

In this case, unless you think that candy and ice cream are the basis of a balanced diet, I think you&#039;ll have to be more careful about generalizing from a single five-year-old!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s an interesting idea.  It makes a lot of sense that we would evolve to find anti-nutrients repulsive.  (I remember being forced to sit at the dinner table until I had finished my lima beans, because they were supposed to be so healthful.  Now we know that they&#039;re crammed with phytic acid and lectins, making it difficult for us to absorb nutrients from other foods we ingest.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To illustrate my point above -- beer, one of the earliest fermented foods, is designed to kill bacteria.  

http://www.beer-brewing.com/beer-brewing/beer_spoilage_organisms/bacteria.htm

&lt;i&gt;Beer is a poor and rather hostile environment for most microorganisms. Its ethanol concentration and low pH is lower than most bacteria can tolerate for growth. Furthermore, the high carbon dioxide concentration and extremely low oxygen content makes beer a near to anaerobic medium. Beer also contains bitter hop compounds, which are toxic. Only a few bacteria are able to grow under such inhospitable conditions and are able to spoil beer. These bacteria include both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species as listed in Table 19.2.
Gram Positive Bacteria

Gram-positive bacteria are generally regarded as the most threatening contaminants in the brewery because of their rapid growth rate and tolerance to high temperatures and low pH conditions. Most hazardous microorganisms are those belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Pediococcus and are often referred to as lactic acid bacteria because of their propensity to produce lactic acid from simple sugars.
Gram Negative Bacteria

Important Gram-negative contaminants in the context of beer brewing are acetic acid bacteria, Zymomonas spp., Pectinatus spp., and various Enterobacteriaceae. Several members of this group not only distort the fermentation process or produce undesired by-products but also have been reported to survive the fermentation process and to transfer into the finished product. &lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;His sonâ€™s counter-intuitive liking for such gourmet â€œadultâ€ foods as pickles, balsamic vinegar, and old cheeses, all high in bacteria,&lt;/i&gt;

@Seth

One, your fundamental assumption that fermented foods are high in bacteria, living or dead, is very, very much to open to debate.  In fact, my guess is that, in general, fermented foods are low in bacteria -- precisely because they are fermented.  We use micro-organisms to kill off/out-compete bacteria to make foods safer for us to eat.  We use fermentation to preserve(!) foods like vinegar, pickles, stinky cheese FROM bacteria, ergo spoilage.

Two, assuming that your assumption above IS correct:  fermented foods are high in bacteria - it is still very much questionable if bacteria from these fermented foods are beneficial to our health.  

Three, you have no mechanism to explain the second assumption.  

While I like and appreciate your intellectual creativity (I read this blog and frequently comment) ---- you exhibit a certain amount intellectual sloppiness that does not behoove you.

And you continue duck me here:

http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/04/05/fermented-good-antibiotic-bad/#comment-288257

&lt;i&gt;puts the picky eating of children in a whole new light. Theyâ€™re not picky â€” theyâ€™re smart.&lt;/i&gt;

Suffice to say, that child above is very atypical of 5 year-olds.  Most children at that age prefer much more bland foods.  

Which might be an evolutionary adaptation for avoiding natural toxins (strong-tasting foods) that young, developing nervous systems can&#039;t handle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This kid seems like an outlier to me.  As a father of a two year old, my observation is that kids like sugar, fruit, crackers, pasta, cereal, white bread, white rice.  The simpler the carbs the better.  Lots of bland food.  I don&#039;t see kids eating lots of stinky cheese, saurkraut, kim chee etc.  I think many of their of their preferences are maladaptive in a modern environment.  I&#039;m not around that many kids though, so I&#039;m interested in what others see.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you ever considered adding red wine to your list of fermented foods?  Wine undergoes multiple fermentations, primary and secondary, with different bacteria.  Some of the products of fermentations are left behind (fining or gravity settling, with racking off of the wine) but some remain in the wine as bottled and shipped.
