		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Great blog!

Here is some research testing hookworm infestation and allergies:http://research.nottingham.ac.uk/Vision/display.aspx?id=1177&amp;pid=213
I believe there are clinics in Europe where they &#039;implant&quot; hookworms to reduce or eliminate your allergies but I do not have a link. I seem to remember 50 worms were too much but 20 seems to work.

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting post.

Some other possibilities are that wheat and casein intakes may have risen over that time (more processed foods).  (Or maybe Vitamin D intake fell, but that seems less plausible.)
