		<description><![CDATA[Actually, I just wanted to fit the words &quot;nit pick&quot; into my reply and that lousy point was the best I could do. The only reason I&#039;m posting this reply is because I forgot to work &quot;lousy&quot; into the previous one. 

Btw., getting rid of hair lice is damned hard (my daughter came home from school with them last year). I assume that for most of human history people spent a lot of time hosting lice. Up until my daughter got them I had used the words &quot;nit pick&quot; with no appreciation for what that really entailed. The way we use &quot;nit pick&quot; is backwards in that it implies excessive criticism. If someone really does go to the effort of picking nits for you, you would really appreciate what they&#039;re doing on your behalf.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gold star for David!  A similar idea brings us to Reiter&#039;s Syndrome, or &quot;reactive arthritis&quot;, which has untreated STI&#039;s as a possible cause.

There are examples in biology of organisms that have been appropriated by our bodies: mitochondria might be from ancient prokaryotes, and surely much of the flora in our gut is useful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I keep getting this strong sense that there is a connection here between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justinowings.com/b/index.php/me/seth-roberts-and-the-shangri-la-diet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fasting/low-carb diets and consuming fermented foods/exposure to foreign substances&lt;/a&gt;: all three of these approaches seem to put our bodies into a state of readiness or alert or perhaps &quot;defense mode&quot; the impact of which is exhibited in any number of improved health markers.  With regard to fasting, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2006/06/22/meal-skipping-good-or-bad/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;From your blog post on meal skipping and the Mattson/Johnson/Laub work (2006)&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since May 2003 we have experimented with alternate day calorie restriction, one day consuming 20-50% of estimated daily caloric requirement and the next day ad lib eating, and have observed health benefits starting in as little as 2 weeks, including insulin resistance, asthma, seasonal allergies, infectious diseases of viral, bacterial and fungal origin (viral URI, recurrent bacterial tonsillitis, chronic sinusitis, periodontal disease), autoimmune disorder (rheumatoid arthritis), osteoarthritis, symptoms due to CNS inflammatory lesions (Touretteâ€™s, Meniereâ€™s) cardiac arrhythmias (PVCs, atrial fibrillation), menopause related hot flashes. We hypothesize that other many conditions would be delayed, prevented or improved, including Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinsonâ€™s, multiple sclerosis, brain injury due to thrombotic stroke atherosclerosis, NIDDM, congestive heart failure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
