		<description><![CDATA[Beriberi is due to thiamine deficiency.  If you&#039;re poor and don&#039;t have a better source of B1 like meat, then yes, you&#039;re better off with brown rice.  Won&#039;t change that the phytic acid and lectins are still going to do bad things to you.  In rice&#039;s defense, if you&#039;re going to have a grain, it seems to have the lowest level of anti nutrients.  Wheat appears to be the worst.]]></description>

Kirk, no I haven&#039;t. I agree, that&#039;s a more interesting question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The lectins concentrated in the bran of grain is also bad for you.  They can damage the intestinal lining, get into the blood, trigger off inflammation, and are likely candidates for binding to insulin and leptin receptors, inducing insulin and leptin resistance, the first stages in metabolic syndrome and obesity.  

Breaking down the lectins is one of the reason traditional societies ferment grains before eating them.  If the grains haven&#039;t been soaked, sprouted and/or fermented though you&#039;re actually better off with the bran removed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, white bread and rice ARE better (maybe I should say less worse) than their whole-grain counterparts IF the whole grain versions are not treated appropriately before consumption. Stephen has many posts at his WholeHealthSource blog discussing how important it is to sprout and/or ferment whole grains to make them nutritious. It turns out that refining flour and rice by removing most of the exterior of the grain--although removing most or all of the vitamins and minerals--does get rid of the phytic acid (an antivitamin if you will) that is so problematic for human digestion and absorption of nutrients. But fitting with your hypothesis, it turns out that the best way to consume grains is to not only soak or sprout them but also to lactoferment them (e.g., with some yogurt or kefir).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why do you think there is a societal aversion to eating out of dumpsters?  Say, even behind a restaurant?  You&#039;ve made many posts on this fermentation hypothesis, but I&#039;m not sure I remember you mentioning once that there is a limit to the idea.  

If you&#039;ve ever eaten rotten food and involuntarily puked soon afterward, you know this upper limit.]]></description>
