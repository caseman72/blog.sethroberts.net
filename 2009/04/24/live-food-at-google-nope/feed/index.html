		<description><![CDATA[Nathan,  by &quot;fermented food&quot; I don&#039;t mean food that has been even a little fermented. If I did then most of the food would qualify, especially the meat, which has been aged. I mean food that has been fermented a lot. I don&#039;t remember seeing any pickles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth,

This is unrelated, but I was out shopping last weekend and ran across this: http://www.pulmuonewildwood.com/ Wildwood organics now offers several new probiotic foods, including hummus, tofu, and tempeh. The hummus is great if you like that sort of thing- I haven&#039;t tried the others.

Anyway, I thought you might be interested.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bread is fermented.  Cheese is fermented.  (The distinction &quot;strong&quot; strikes me as special pleading.  Anyway, no feta? No gorgonzola? Really?)  Greek olives are fermented.  Pizza ingredients are mostly fermented. Soy sauce is often fermented, particularly the better brands likely used there.  

No pickles?  Really?  How about salami?  Chocolate?  Black tea?]]></description>
