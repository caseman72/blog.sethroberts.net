		<description><![CDATA[My precious Rejuvelac!

I wish it was easier to find. I recently found that the grocery store down the street from my house (Community Market in Santa Rosa) sells it. After a six year break, I&#039;ve become re-addicted.

This stuff is amazing. I only wish it was more readily available.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
My husband forwarded this post to me and has been telling me all about your posts on fermented foods.  What are your thoughts on tempeh and miso?  I am soy intolerant, but for some reason I can eat both of these.  Someone told me it has something to do with them being fermented.  Do you recommend eating either?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d have to recommend the Kombucha from Synergy, it&#039;s got 2g of naturally occurring sugar compared to 12g from rejuvenation.  

I&#039;m not sure what it is, but between the carbonation, sour tinge, and the bite from the ginger, it tastes really sweet to me.  I really wish the store wouldn&#039;t refrigerate it though so it&#039;d be more carbonated and fermented when I got it.  

BTW, thanks  for educating me about the importance of fermented foods.  I&#039;ve started eating them with every meal.  I didn&#039;t even get close to getting sick this winter and my allergies are sharply reduced this spring.  It&#039;s really improved my quality of life.]]></description>
