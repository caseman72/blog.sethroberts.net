		<description><![CDATA[I have been living in the Caribbean (BVI)  for over 15 years with my husband who has been diagnosed with senile dementia. There are other people in the same situation here as well as with Alzheimer&#039;s.  I wonder how far they&#039;ve looked for evidence.  I use coconut oil and rotate it with others in cooking (pancakes, eggs) but not stirred in cereal. I&#039;ll try this and see if there is any change.  We live near a transformer the government swears is not doing any h arm.  I documented the energy levels.  Have taken precautionary measures when I knew its danger and put physical remedies in place.  We are in the process of relocating.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Word of caution to those who subscribe to the mainstream medicine mantra and dismiss the &quot;anecdotal&quot; and the un-&quot;scientifically proven&quot; theories outside the norm in mainstream medicine - your habits and your beliefs may lead you to an early grave. 
Why is it that people tout taking Coconut Oil from nature and created by God, not man, as extremely harmful due to some diarhea or some other minor side effect that might occur - and becoming violently ill or dying from prescription drugs is of little concern? or stacking drug on top of drug on top of drug into an elderly persons daily regimen is acceptable when everyone knows there is no scientific study done on any multi-layered therapy like that where you have a cholesterol med, sleep aid, mental health pill, anxiety pill, 4 different pills for side effects and who knows what else? Come on people - these are human beings who have families and friends and deserve to be treated as such - not filled with pharmaceutical drugs and left to die at whatever pace they might die at.

Thanks Seth! Keep up the good work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just bought some virgin coconut oil today at Whole Foods.  Started mom out with 1 tablespoon in the morning and one on the evening.  I also ordered some MCT oil (gold) over the internet. Mom has dementia that has progressed in the last 6 months especially after she had a fall 3 weeks ago.  One of her Dr&#039;s gave her Aricept awhile ago which made her violently ill so I am all for anything that is natural.  I will keep posting here as to her progress to let everyone know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I gave my mom some cocnut oil I had in my cupboard right after reading Mary Newport&#039;s article.  Does it matter if it&#039;s virgin, or refined cocnut oil?  I had the refined, for high heat cooking.  It has little to no scent or taste.  Does the refining process affect the MCTs?  The next day, we bought virgin organic atthe health food store, thinking that the product should be in its most raw form, but she can&#039;t stand the smell, or taste.  (Funny thing - she loves coconut!)  We began this three days ago, and I do see some mild improvement.  Her mood has been good, and she is a bit more fluid in her vocabulary.  I am hopeful.  Thanks for this blog.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For those that get diarreah with Coconut we found that using it with vitamin D supplement helped to balance the problem. My Dad used to get constipated using vitamin D, so now he can use those supplements without any problems. My father is also allergic to dairy products and doesnt go out as much anymore to expose to sun rays, so Vitamin D supplement is good  for him. Also it seems that as we get older the absobtion of this vitamin sometimes slows down as well.

http://1stholistic.com/nutrition/hol_nutr-toxic-dosages.htm

We do not want to impose this coconut diet to anyone but just offer testimony of the benefits we experienced. Scientific or not, we have been on this diet for about a year now, and Coconut did not seem to hurt anyone in my family, so we continue using it with much faith and hope as we got positive results. My Dad suffered advanced Dementia and he is doing a lot better now . He is back to his family life and normal functions and that is what we care about.

Sorry to hear that some people did not get positive results, it is important to follow the diet by also eliminating saturated fats , vegetable oils , margarine and mayonaise. Also we has used coconut along with MCT oil, Omega 3 or fish to get good results. We are also into organic foods and natural medicine. 

I have found studies showing the benefits of coconut. Also there are statistics on countries that use coconut and fish in their diets and the low rates of certain diseases. We need to remember that science do not always hold all the answers.  I found these web sites hope they can help:

We know how frustrating it could get , best wishes for those  who are  fighting against Alzheimers and Dementia.  
Keep the hope ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After Mom learned about Mary Newport &#039;s discovery in a Tampa newspaper article last year, we began the diet for my Dad (age 88) and suffering from vascular dementia . Two weeks after using the Extra Virgin Coconut oil he got up from bed and was back into his normal functions , going to the bathroom by himself and doing much better. After a month my Dad began remembering family members as normal and getting (mentally) more clear. After six months in the coconut oil , MCT and Omega 3 diet my Dad can remember and says his prayers and is more sociable. We do not give him any food containing vegetable oils, mayonaise, margarine, etc ... The main ingredient we use in food preparation is Coconut (coconut milk, coconut oil, MCT oil) also extra virgin olive oil and the Omega 3, three times a day. He hasnt have a set back since he got in this diet and he no longer needs to use diappers. It has been a tremendous brake for Mom who is the main care taker...The doctor has said that my Dad has came back to who he was before.  My Dad is hypersensitive to medications so he is mostly on supplements and vitamins. We give him alternative medicine for all his conditions and he is responding real well. Now all the family uses the Coconut diet as a regular diet since it is so healthy...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I started this with my father who is well beyond MCI - a combination of smoking and drinking to excess in earlier years, 17 meds for COPD and congestive heart failure, etc.  Although he&#039;s not the Mensa thinker he was in his 50&#039;s, at 89, his is much more alert, happier, and his well-being has been enhanced. If I had known about this earlier, I would have done it years ago.  He gets a tablespoon in his cheese grits in the morning, plus another tablespoon in the evening, usually in Tang or in some juice. Yes, it sits on the top, and you have to stir it in, or heat the juice a little.  (Yes, and no comments re: cheese grits - at this age, you feed them what they will eat, LOL)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding diarrhea and oil: I have heard that coconut oil should be introduced slowly into one&#039;s diet, because it is an anti-fungal, I believe, and likely to cause die-off.  Perhaps starting with a small amount and gradually increasing would help.  Or, I would imagine that it would be easier on the stomach if taken with something else, such as spread on bread.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Snake oil helped the chinese who were hewing a railroad bed out of the rocky mountains. Dr. Newport is serious about coconut oil-so I am. There is no big money in coconut oil so don&#039;t expect the drug companies to get excited. The largest, best test starts with a single anecdote. If you think it wont work for you, you are correct--this is the negative placebo effect. Most medicine needs faith for good results. I tried coconut oil but found diarrhea to be a problem. Any suggestions on Diarrhea from all that oil?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure, sure. I&#039;ve researched the entire Internet for the curative powers of coconut oil for Alzheimer&#039;s (my mother suffers it) and NOTHING. How can the entire world be spinning the story of a &quot;fact&quot; about which there&#039;s NO EVIDENCE? I&#039;m very glad for Dr. Newport and her husband, but PLEASE TREAT SERIOUS ISSUES SERIOUSLY! We&#039;ve come a long way (or haven&#039;t we?) since the old times of snake oil!  So many months later, where is at least ONE MORE CASE of an Alzheimer&#039;s patient who has benefitted from coconut? PLEASE!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My husband, 54, had begun showing troubling signs of MCI about three years ago. An economist and mathematician, his increasing incidences of errors in calculations, and sometimes misunderstanding what others were talking about were definitely not like him at all.  I was secretly very worried, and insisted on cognitive testing.  Oddly, though, he scored very high in every area, including IQ and cognitive reaction.  After showing him your December 2008 post about Steve Newport&#039;s results, we agreed to try a judicious regimen of daily coconut oil, starting in January 2009.   Within two weeks I could see improvements, and today we both agree that something is very much changed.  I can see that his mental acuity is back normal, and he never forgets an appointment.  I am very grateful to you for this, and for the link to this new website, which I shall be watching very carefully.  Thank you for your always finely crafted, intelligent and thought provoking blog.]]></description>
