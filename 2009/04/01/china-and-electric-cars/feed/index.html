		<description><![CDATA[Nadav, I think Chinese students who get Ph.D.&#039;s in America are becoming more likely to return to China (comparing now with 10 years ago, say) because of more opportunities to do research and better business opportunities.

NE1, I think elite American grad schools do accept more Tsinghua students than students from any particular elite American school. More Tsinghua students than MIT students, for example. I am trying to say that there is no great difference in the formal education received by the best Chinese engineers and the best American engineers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your last sentence is a non-sequitur.  I might draw from your interesting fact that Tsinghua is big, and maybe that it produces more reliable graduates than other Chinese institutions.  If individual elite schools accepted more from Tsinghua than a particular large elite American school, then I would start to reconsider.  It&#039;s obviously tough to tell though, because of visa stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Please. It is far easier to clean the output of a few hundred power plants than a few hundred million cars.

Also, plugin-hybrids and electric cars are typically charged over night during off-peak times, so they improve the efficiency of the power plants.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Do you have a sense of whether Tsinghua undergraduates who come to America for graduate school tend to stay in America (or wish they could) or return to China to pursue their careers?]]></description>
