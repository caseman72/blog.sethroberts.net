		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

Came across your blog.  I am interested in finding out what kind of probiotic you used ( name, manufacture etc ).

Thanks.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey y&#039;all,

I stumbled across something a while back that you might be interested in.  I&#039;ve been suffering from allergies, allergic asthma, and exercise induced asthma for most of my life.  I&#039;ve taken some form of fast acting inhaler since I was about 14 (I&#039;m now 44).  I didn&#039;t take anything before that because the doctors attributed my breathing problems to simple allergies.  I began taking steroidal inhalers approximately 18 years ago. 

The steroid inhalers worked well at first and allowed me to continue my passion of jogging.  Then, over the course of a couple of years, I could no longer jog during the colder months.  This progressively got worse over the years to the point I had to take 4 fast acting inhaler puffs during exercise and even that wasn&#039;t working well at all.  Finally, after nearly going to the hospital after one particularly bad bout of exercise induced asthma, I went back to the internet in research.

Before this, I had tried everything under the sun.  I tried Vitamin D; it didn&#039;t work, but it did help my nasal allergies somewhat.  I tried low carb dieting, and just like Dr. Lutz of &quot;Life Without Bread&quot; said, it made asthma worse while it practically cured my nasal allergies.  I also tried the Dr. Sears approach of taking as much as 7.5g of EPA/DHA a day; no change at all in the exercise induced asthma. 

During this research, however, I re-reviewed the probiotic slant and found the Helminth story and all the trials that were going on in pubmed for them.  With that logic in hand, I set about to find a probiotic that worked.  I tried yogurt, kefir, fermented cabbage, and buttermilk to no avail.  I then tried store bought probiotics one by one.  I tried The Maker&#039;s Diet probiotic and it didn&#039;t help; but I do think it helped make a 20 year long wart go away.  I also tried all forms of probiotics on the market; even LGG.  Nothing.  

Finally, one day I bought this super high dose probiotic and took it along with a L. Sporogenes/bacillus coagulans.  Voila, three days later I could really feel the difference during exercise.  I continued that for 10 days.  By the 10th day, I didn&#039;t have to hit my inhaler at all during exercise.  Wow!

First, I had to decide which probiotic did the trick.  I didn&#039;t want to spend a ton on that high dose probiotic, so I stuck with the Bacillus Coagulans and it continued working normally.  So, I found my probiotic.  Now, I needed to verify it wasn&#039;t placebo.  A close cousin to exercise induced asthma is the phenomenon of waking up sneezing and then promptly getting an asthma attack/or closure after that.  

I went off my bacillus coagulans that I had been on for 14 days.  By the second day, I noticed a little difference.  By the third day, I had to hit my inhaler during the workout.  By the 10th day (bacillus coagulans supposedly lives in your intestines 7 days), I was full-blown back to having to use 4 inhaler puffs and it wasn&#039;t doing the trick.  This was test phase one.

I then went back on the bacillus coagulans for 10 days.  The same process repeated itself.  The nightly asthma attacks abated after about 4 days and the same no-puff needed during exercise continued as well.  

I then went back off the bacillus coagulans for 10 days.  I got the asthma back at day 3.  

I&#039;ve now been back on 5 billion CFU&#039;s of bacillus coagulans (duraflora) for 18 days.  I don&#039;t have to use my inhaler for exercise.  I can feel the asthma come on very slightly and then go away.  I&#039;ll be curious to see if the success of this treatment continues through the toughest time of the year for me (the fall).  

The only side effect I&#039;ve noticed is a sticky feeling in my hands that comes and goes along with a little itching on my nose, eyes, and ears that is not bad.  

I&#039;d love to see if anyone else sees similar results.

		<description><![CDATA[I am so glad I found this blog.

My daughter has had the coughing fits for 24 months (she&#039;s 5 1/2 yo).

Inhalers, several doctors, ona nd on nothing help.  She routinely coughed until vomiting.   After one 10 hour coughing fit I reached my limit and scoured the web.

After putt in her whole medical history as search qualifiers I found this.  The prior ezcema and antibiotics were key indicators.

After 3 days of drinking 1 probiotic shake a day, she showed very marked improvement.  After 1 week, no symptoms.  This is a girl who&#039;s been unable to run and play for 2 years.  Who woke up coughing and gagging most nights.

After 6 weeks of the same regimen, she still shows no symptoms and is running and playing full blast.

The pulmonary specialist discounts the results we&#039;ve seen as a fluke . . . we&#039;ll see.  Previously my daughter&#039;s lung capacity was measured at 47% of expected.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Carol:- The idea is that the probiotics are cultures of friendly bacteria that then reproduce rapidly and colonise the gut.   You only need a few to get the process going.

The Hygiene Hypothesis makes great sense in the mysteries surrounding allergies and the overcleanliness of the modern world has given us a problem.  As my father-in-law used to say &quot;let them eat mud&quot;.   They might get all sorts of other problems but less allergies

I hope that helps]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, have you considered probiotic supplementation?  I generally supplement during and after an anti-biotic regimen but am now quite curious about daily doses.  Would also be curious about your take on pill-form probiotics vs. dietary changes.
