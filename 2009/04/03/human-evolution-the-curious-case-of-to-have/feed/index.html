		<description><![CDATA[The first step of the game could very well be called &quot;I want your keys&quot;.  But the game is called &quot;where are your keys?&quot; because that simple question is the next step or level in fluency progressing from &quot;what&quot; and &quot;who&quot; and &quot;which&quot; questions to &quot;where&quot; and &quot;when&quot; and &quot;how&quot; questions.  A fast fluency level probing question in any language is &quot;Where are your keys?&quot;  By the answer I know almost exactly how fluent a person is.

The hand signs are important to the speed of language transition. If a student is gesturing &quot;yes&quot; but is voicing &quot;no&quot; then I know two things... First, that the student isn&#039;t sure of the correct language.  Second, I know that the student means what they are signing and not what is coming out of their mouth.  It is a strange phenomenon but almost 100% accurate.  We call this technique &quot;your lips say no but your body says yes.&quot; So watch for the persons body language, not their verbal language... if you know how to read body language (sign language) you will gather more of the true communication and less of the noise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where Are Your Keys? only has a few converts because I have only told a few people about it.  It is a game that I made up by watching how the most effective teachers teach.  The subject matter is not that important.  The important thing is that certain learning/teaching techniques work, so why not use the most effective techniques as much of the time as possible... and why not train the students to use the same techniques on the teacher not only to more effectively â€œfishâ€ for the target information but to simultaneously show the teacher their (the studentâ€™s) current level of mastery both in the target subject as well as the teaching methodology.   In that way you train fluent students who are at the same time teachers in training.

That is the quick answer of Where Are Your Keys?

As to the learning of a language... SPEED is the most important uniting concept.

1. Speed to acquire the target information ( a new language),

2. Speed to acquire faster more effective learning tools to exponentially increase the learning itself.

If you are going to learn a language then learn it as fast as possible.

In order the learning and teaching of languages should proceed in this order...

Limit the number of nouns. 10 nouns should teach you any language.
(choose your nouns well)
Agree on hand signs for each of the nouns.
Agree on hand signs for the following words in this order.  ( I use American Sign Language (ASL) and Pidgin Signed English (PSE) because you might as well learn two languages at the same time.

Give each participant an object...
This object or prop from the 10 nouns is now that persons (ownership).

I, you, he, she, it, we, you all, they
mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, your alls, theirs

want, have, give, take

I want your rock.

you want my food?

you want me give you my food? then you give me your rock.

If this is the fastest way to learn an language they why wouldnâ€™t it be the foundation, the origin, the â€œneeds gapâ€ solution to all our problems?

I want what you have!

Small kids begin to practice their understanding of abstract language very early.  They hold up and object (usually that is clearly NOT theirs) and ask â€œMINE?â€

This question is usually linked to an object that they want or at least like.

Origin of language?

At least it is the origin of each personsâ€™ relationship with language.

If you are in a language class of any kind and they do not cover â€œwant, have, give, takeâ€ in the first few classes (some languages are harder to deal with than others and need some set up to get to this point) either ask or leave and find someone else who will tell you.  Then go back to class and try to talk the teacher out of items that are â€œHISâ€ or â€œHERSâ€  You may have to trade something of â€œYOURSâ€]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of the language-learning game &quot;Where Are Your Keys?&quot; devised by Evan Gardner. As I understand it, the language learner has to use signing and the objects to hand to get from the teacher how to name things and talk about their ownership and possession (hence the game&#039;s name). One of the first challenges is to persuade the teacher to hand over (or swap) something of his.
Gardner claims this play makes for very rapid language acquisition, which seems to chime with your theory.
&quot;Where Are Your Keys?&quot; sounds fascinating but seems to have only a very few converts. The only information I have about it is from the podcast below:

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read some of the pages you linked.  Specialization is a very late, perhaps even civilized development.  Our own recent ancestors, almost in living memory, spun, wove, and sewed their own clothes.  Ã–tzi the Iceman, 5300 years ago, made his own arrows and participated directly in smelting copper, yet roamed the hills like a shepherd.

You have to go back to &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt; -- more than a million years -- to discover what differences set humanity on its exceptional course, and then somehow distinguish those from others that arose &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; we were different. If &lt;i&gt;H. erectus&lt;/i&gt; had speech, then speech happened far too long ago to relate to any detail in present human behavior.  If speech came later, then it&#039;s a downline consequence of human exceptionalism.

Anyway, it&#039;s absurd to conjecture that a dozen defining differences arose spontaneously at the same time.  One or two distinguished us, and the rest are consequences or incidentals.  Speech cannot be among the one or two, because the rest (e.g. upright posture) cannot be consequents of it.

American libertarians insist that free markets are not an invention, but arise spontaneously as a necessary consequence of natural laws.  You&#039;re drifting dangerously close to their orbit.

Yes, it&#039;s interesting that commerce is an example of an activity that can make use of subgrammatical language, but that&#039;s no basis for a theory of language origin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That came out more combative than I intended.  

My contention that nobody has any reason to pay attention to such speculations is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; because you&#039;re not a linguist.  Rather, it&#039;s simply because nobody -- not me, not a linguist, and not you -- can have anything useful to say about the origin of human language.  It&#039;s not subject to any sort of verification.  All our historical evidence, including any irregularities in treatment of &quot;to have&quot;, is many, many linguistic generations removed from language&#039;s origins.  There&#039;s just been plenty of time for all echoes of the origins to wash away and be replaced by modern substitutions, and for those to wash away and be replaced again.

<p>My contention that nobody has any reason to pay attention to such speculations is <i>not</i> because you&#8217;re not a linguist.  Rather, it&#8217;s simply because nobody &#8212; not me, not a linguist, and not you &#8212; can have anything useful to say about the origin of human language.  It&#8217;s not subject to any sort of verification.

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, this particular data is tied in with many other data that support my ideas about human evolution, which I&#039;ve blogged about many times. You seem to be saying because I&#039;m not a linguist &quot;no one has any sound reason to pay attention&quot; but I think you&#039;re wrong: I think linguists should be interested in how data outside linguistics -- from my many other posts on human evolution -- can shed light on how language began. This is the sort of thing that a non-linguist is  more likely to do than a linguist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This could be a fun notion to speculate about, but (1) it&#039;s not subject to experiment, and (2) it&#039;s _particularly_ not subject to self-experiment. No one has any sound reason to pay attention to what you say about it, and anyone else caught up in it is the least likely to have anything interesting to say.  This is your blog, and you can write about whatever you like, but as it gets less interesting, it gets harder to justify time to read it.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I never noticed that &quot;mei&quot; (the correct pin yin spelling of the word, you spelled it as &quot;mai&quot; - it is pronounced as &quot;may&quot;) is only used to negate &quot;you&quot; (to have), and all other verbs in Mandarin are negated with &quot;bu&quot;. Q: &quot;Ni You, mei you che fan?&quot; = &quot;Have you eaten yet?&quot; (note that &quot;mei you&quot; is pronounced as &quot;mayo&quot; as in &quot;tuna on rye, hold the mayo&quot;). A: &quot;you&quot; = I have. &quot;mei you&quot; = I haven&#039;t. Q: &quot;Ni Shi, bu shi da xue lao shi&quot; = &quot;Are you a college professor?&quot;. A: &quot;Shi&quot; = I am. &quot;Bu shi&quot; = I am not.

It&#039;s also interesting that many languages such as French (and other Latin-based languages?) express feelings and states of being with an ownership verb. Such as &quot;I have hunger&quot;, &quot;I have 34 years&quot; (instead of I am 34 years old).]]></description>
