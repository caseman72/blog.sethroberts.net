		<description><![CDATA[[...] Yesterday at a Carrefour I watched a pig being cut up. The butcher cut off the skin (with a thick layer of fat) and tossed it into a section of the display of pork for sale. I could buy the part of the pig I valued most for an incredibly low price (about 25 cents/pound). All other pork cost more. That&#8217;s how much Chinese shoppers wanted it. No one rushed to buy the newly-cut piece of skin. It reminded me of New York where I tried to buy food past its expiration date, ordinarily considered worthless. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I came across something interesting about fermentation in the latest National Geographical.  The cover story is about the discovery of a baby mammoth in Siberia.  Although when found it was free of the ice it hadn&#039;t decayed.  On examination it was found that it had been &quot;pickled&quot;  just through being in the water and thus preserved.  

This was noticed by one of the researchers who noticed the pickled smell as he was doing  the discection.  It reminded him of experiments that he had done to see whetehr primitive hunter gatherers coudl have peeserved meat in this way.   He submerged meat in a pool of water and found it was naturally picled by the bateria present.  Hence his theory that hunters could have  killed large prey (mammoths) and then perserved / fermented / pickled the meat for a long period after:

I&#039;d advise looking at the magazine, but  it is covered here:

http://amandainmaine.wordpress.com/2009/04/21/a-near-perfect-frozen-mammoth-resurfaces-after-40000-years/

&lt;i&gt;Tikhonov knew that no one would be more excited by the find than Dan Fisher, an American colleague at the University of Michigan. Fisher is a soft-spoken, 59-year-old paleontologist with a bristly white beard and clear green eyes who has devoted much of the past 30 years to understanding the lives of Pleistocene mammoths and mastodons, combining fossil studies with some very hands-on experimental research. Curious to know how Paleolithic hunters managed to store mammoth meat without spoilage, &lt;b&gt;Fisher butchered a draft horse using stone tools heâ€™d knapped himself, then cached the meat in a stock pond. Naturally preserved by microbes called lactobacilli in the water, the flesh emitted a faintly sour, pickled odor that put off scavengers even when it floated to the surface. To test its palatability, Fisher cut and ate steaks from the meat every two weeks from February until high summer&lt;/b&gt;, demonstrating that mammoth hunters might have stored their kills in the same way.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Another intriguing question is how Lyuba avoided decomposition and destruction. Undoubtedly she was frozen in permafrost for most of the time between her death and discovery, but Fisher and Buigues determined that the carcass lay on the riverbank for nearly a year before the reindeer herders stumbled upon it.

&quot;That means that this baby mammoth, flesh and all, sat out on the side of the river all of the Arctic summer of 2006, which would have subjected the carcass to 24-hour-a-day sunlight, elevated temperatures and exposure to bacteria and scavengers,&quot; Fisher said. &quot;So why is it preserved as well as it is?&quot;

Based on previous experiments aimed at understanding how Paleolithic hunters stored meat from large animal kills, Fisher believes Lyuba was naturally pickled in lactic acid produced by microbes called lactobacilli. The pickling would have protected her body from decomposition, and the sour smell likely deterred scavengers.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are discount stores near where I live that sell a lot of products that are close to the expiration date or sometimes well past the date.  Plus once the date has passed the price drops to almost nothing.  I regularly buy organic yogurt, cottage cheese, and cream for 25 or 50 cents.  I have no idea why these places thrive on expired products while other places aren&#039;t allowed to sell them.

Seth (or anyone else who knows), how do you know what foods might develop &quot;bad&quot; bacteria that could make you really sick or even kill you?  I have no problem with aged fermented or cultured products.  But leaving regular food out to age makes me nervous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, if your theory about fermented foods is correct, you might also consider what washing the skin with soap could do to the immune system. Every part of the skin has a characteristic microbial flora, which differs according to area, e.g. the feet have a different bacterial population than the lower back. Presumably these bacteria interact with the immune system, and killing them off every day with soap could have deleterious health effects.]]></description>
