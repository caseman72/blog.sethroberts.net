		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Andrew. I agree that some designs are better than others. But I disagree that there is no Uncertainty Principle. In your example -- the within-subject design -- where you seem to say no price is paid for wide variation in subjects, there is indeed a price because it is likely that there is nonzero treatment x subject interaction, which inflates the error term. The greater the subject-to-subject variation, the greater the inflation of the error term. The Uncertainty Principle also applies to the treatment. The more precisely the treatment is repeated from one subject to the next the clearer any difference will be (because &quot;treatment error&quot; is minimized) but the less well you can generalize to other treatments. Herb Clark, a psych professor at Stanford, made similar points in a well-known-to-psychologists verbal-learning paper about 30 years ago. He explained the difference between a random and a fixed effect. It&#039;s another example of what I&#039;m talking about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  I guess I was not clear in my comment.  The design you advocate is a special case of the standard blocking or pairing design that I describe; in this case the blocks are individual mice that are each given multiple treatments.

My point was that your statement that &quot;the two groups (treatment and control) were too similar prior to getting the treatment&quot; is a separate issue from generalizability.  You can have the two groups be very similar (for example, by reusing your experimental subjects, as you suggest in your comment) and still have wide variation within group.  There is no &quot;Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle&quot; here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, 

Just wanted to thank you for inspiring me to practice self-experimentation. I am half-way through 30 days of restricting calories, trying to be as self-examining as possible. I&#039;m dumping the basic recordings of this experiment on this blog: 

http://thirtydaysdown.blogspot.com/

I&#039;m averaging about 650 calories a day and have learned that the hunger sensation is easily tamed but coping with the mental effects of low blood sugar is difficult and I may be eating more sugar than I did before the diet started. By adding a bit of sugar to my tea and eating dry apricots through the day I am almost 100% fine until evening meal time. I was going to use a tablespoon of oil a day to dampen my hunger but my body seems to be coping just fine - that said, this is more of a crash course experiment versus a longer term weight loss programme. The other big observation so far is that while the blanket advice is to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables I find the former far less effective in terms of satiety and have steered away from almost all fruit over the period (except the magic dried apricots!).

I&#039;m enjoying your next adventure in the realm of fermented foods and look forward to the findings. Just a shame I can&#039;t find natto so easily here in the UK. All the best, Riz.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andy M, yeah, I agree, self-experimentation won&#039;t replace testing drugs on animals. I&#039;m saying that the conventional view that animal models are good and self-experimentation is bad isn&#039;t supported by these particular facts.

Andrew, the psychologists I know don&#039;t like the two-group (control and experimental) design you and Rosenbaum describe. They prefer a design in which each subject is his own control. You compare the same subject with and without the treatment. In the within-subject design, you are not penalized for increasing subject-to-subject variation, the way you are in a between-subject design, where the control group and the treatment group consist of different subjects. Because the &quot;ideal study&quot; you describe has lots of between group variation, it is less than ideal for detecting a difference between the groups.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your perspective on this, Seth. In response to Andy M.&#039;s comment above: yes, that&#039;s right, the criticism here doesn&#039;t apply to all uses of mice or other animals in research. Howard Florey ran his crucial test on using penicillin to cure bacterial infection in living mammals using only 8 mice. All were given a big does of streptococci, four got penicillin injections. Untreated mice were dead overnight; three of the others survived. A large increase in confidence obtained. To get to Seth&#039;s point, though, look how &quot;poorly&quot; this experiment was designed. No randomization, no double blinding, no repeat trials; just a crappy little home brew test of an idea that helped significantly to get the ball rolling to save millions (well, tens of millions) of lives. I really think this is an important point. There isn&#039;t a &quot;gold standard&quot; for scientific truth in the sense of a standard experimental design that will settle all questions. There is a step by step process of confidence building. Reducing statistical &quot;noise&quot; in an experiment carries a cost. When you are as ignorant of the underlying biology as we are (not a criticism of the scientists personally, this is a general ignorance) about ALS, the real problems may not come from conventional errors in experimental design... That&#039;s the point, at least, as I take it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  Paul Rosenbaum wrote an article in which he discussed the benefits of having a wide range of cases in your treatment and control groups.  However, I disagree with your statement about treatment and control groups being too similar.  The ideal study would have a large amount of variation in treatment and control groups, but with random assignment so that the two groups are, on average, similar.  You can use a method such as blocking or pairing to reduce noise; this is not in conflict with the goal of generalizability.  These are really two different issues.]]></description>
