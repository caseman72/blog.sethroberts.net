How is that you don&#039;t know if variety is important, but are sure that quantity matters?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is variety of bacteria an important part of your hypothesis? 

I ask because, the process of pickling, which is an anaerobic fermentation process as well, is done specifically to preserve food by making the food hostile to (other) forms of bacteria. Thus the food after pickling, contains fewer variety of bacteria than before, but a higher volume of the fermenting bacteria (I&#039;m guessing). 

I&#039;m not yet sure if even the fermenting bacteria is left behind after pickling. I can think of fermentation/pickling as a self-limiting process that stops when the acids produced kill of most of the fermenting bacteria themselves (this is similar to what Patrick says).

But that&#039;s a different matter; for now I&#039;m interested in your thoughts on variety vs. volume.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Confidence, by &quot;better&quot; I mean healthier. I eat yogurt for the bacteria -- the more bacteria the better.

Chris, yes, I believe I can improve food by leaving it unrefrigerated, and I&#039;ve been doing that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought you were making your own yogurt - as I plan to do.  What does this store bought yogurt offer that home made does not?

On a related note, you&#039;ve given us so many recommendations over the months ... do you maintain a central list of preferred fermented foodstuffs and brands?  Thanks.]]></description>
