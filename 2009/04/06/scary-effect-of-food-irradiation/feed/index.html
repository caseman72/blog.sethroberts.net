		<description><![CDATA[Wow.  This is scary stuff.  This is why I only eat organic type food when possible.  Food today in general has to be about the worst at any time period.  If it is killing cats, amazing.  What is it doing to us?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No amount of testing can demonstrate that irradiation is safe in general.  If it could be demonstrated for one particular foodstuff (say, kiwi fruit) that wouldn&#039;t tell you anything about papayas or beef jerky, or even about kiwi grown with different pesticides. 

If irradiated food is killing cats, that&#039;s an enormous problem, _particularly_ if the problem is neurological.  Psychoactive drugs are routinely tested in cats because cat brains respond to chemicals more like ours than rats&#039; do.]]></description>
