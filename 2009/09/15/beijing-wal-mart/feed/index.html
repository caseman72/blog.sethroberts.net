		<description><![CDATA[Great read! 

I&#039;ve just moved to Beijing and am sooo excited to go to Walmart today. I am a born and raised New Yorker who only got to visit Walmarts a few times a year when I went out of state. I can&#039;t believe now that I live on the other side of the world, I have one so readily available to me. This will be added to my list of reasons why I am loving Beijing (I am sure after my honeymoon period I will have an accompanying list of reason why I don&#039;t like Beijing too...hehe).

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth; I came upon your website after I googled the words &quot;Walmart in Beijing&quot; along with &quot;subway&quot;  and just dropped by to read what your blog had to say about it.  I was just wondering, what&#039;s the nearest metro/subway station for any  branch of Wal-mart in Beijing (preferably the one nearest the Tiannamen West subway station)? I am currently on a holiday here till Tuesday afternoon and would like to  since it did not mention in this particular entry. Would appreciate any info. Thanls on adv. and keep blogging :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People in America need to realize jus what got America in this shapeâ€¦â€cheapâ€ yes so-call cheap items from a foreign land.

quote*Wal-Mart firmly believes in local procurement. We recognize that by purchasing quality products, we can generate more job opportunities, support local manufacturing and boost economic development. Over 95% of the merchandise in our stores in China is sourced locally. We have established partnerships with nearly 20,000 suppliers in China. *end quote!

Now! if there be 182 countryâ€™s making items for the world to buy and they have only 5% of the pie in Chinaâ€¦duh! This company makes the nice people of China support their currency(yuan) by keeping it in their country working for the people thereâ€¦. but with the â€œyuanâ€ going up in value and the US dollar going downâ€¦all the foreign items that the American consumer buys thinking it is cheap has went up in price.

Peopleâ€¦its all about the currency and to keep a currency strong you got to keep it floating around the country you live in so it can work for you. For the past 12 years all them US dollars are being shipped overseas to a foreign bank and with the American worker not making anything for the foreigner to buy the â€œwe the peopleâ€ have to turn to the â€œsecondâ€ largest employer in America(Uncle Sam) to sell â€œwe the peopleâ€ debt in order to get all them dollars back!

50 years ago a foreigner would had given their left nut for a US dollar or a Hersheyâ€™s chocolate bar and today the same foreigner has got Uncle Sam and the American consumer by both all the while Hershey is moving the chocolate factory to Mexico. Wake up! America and think â€œMADE IN AMERICA.â€

quote*&quot;Considering that there are over 30,000 ships at sea this morning,&quot; writes James Carlton, director of the Williams College-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program, in an e-mail, &quot;the total number of organisms and species in this global &#039;bioflow&#039; on the morning your readers read your piece could be staggering - billions of individuals, and thousands of species.&quot;

Indeed, scientists have long considered ballast water the primary way invasive aquatic organisms are introduced. From the zebra mussel&#039;s arrival in the Great Lakes, to an American jellyfish severely disrupting Black Sea fisheries, the potential costs of accidental introduction of a species to new homes can be tremendous. Aquatic invasives cost the US $9 billion yearly, according to estimates by David Pimentel, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. Zebra and quagga mussels (a cousin to the zebra) alone cost the $1 billion annually.*end quote!

tat is $9 billion a year in hidden taxes to all Americans...
cheap ain&#039;t chic and it cost America............jobs!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Have I told you about the time I took a cleaver on the Beijing Subway? The Beijing Subway has security: They screen all bags. It started before the Olympics and, after the Olympics ended, kept going. At Wal-Mart, I bought a cleaver/cutting board/chopstick set (enclosed in plastic), put it in my laptop bag, and entered the subway. I was stopped. The cleaver had shown up on the scanner screen. The guard was pleasant and after I showed her what it was I was quickly sent on my way. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, in the USA the Wal-Marts are very much inconveniently located if you are a backpacker or (caution 70&#039;s lingo ahead) a hippie type on foot! As a red blooded, job working, wage earning, tax paying, car driving American I thank God everyday for this... LMAO! 

Now if they can on figure out how to keep out the 17 other catagories of undesirable shoppers I would be in heaven. Hopefully they will not go to the 18th catagory, because that includes me... LMAO

I love visiting American chains overseas, regardless of the type of business. It is very interesting to take note of how the service and or merchandise is tweaked to suit the local taste and or cultural norms. You can learn a lot about a local culture this way because you have a mental baseline to measure the deviation.

Because of this I am now so curious I am going to visit the Beijing Wal-Mart this afternoon and have a look around! 

Any Costcos in the area? Loved visiting them in Taiwan and comparing.]]></description>

I have never seen a kid pee or poop on the floor at a store (in the street, yes) but you clearly know more about this than I do. There are no measuring cups anywhere, not just Wal-Mart. There is a huge selection of pickles (perhaps 30 kinds) at the Beijing Wal-Mart but they don&#039;t look like American pickles. As for the baked goods, they have a big selection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the selection at Wal-mart in China is terrible. The clothes are too small
and they don&#039;t even have simple things like aspirin, mustard, french dressing, croutons, pickles, waffles, measuring cups, deodorant, syrup, Kool Aid, Frito&#039;s, pita bread, English muffins, bagels, hot dog buns, taco shells, root beer, or 
all-purpose flour. Parents in China allow kids to pee and poop on the floor
of stores, too.]]></description>

The news has more or less been silenced. If you google the event from Beijing, you&#039;ll find the links to news stories about this blocked.

		<description><![CDATA[There are lots of tandem or even three-at-once (in a single direction) escalators in hong kong.  I think maybe there is a 6 laner (at least!) in Central MTR station.  Brilliantly, the directions of the escalators changes depending on usage patterns -- may be balanced 3/3 or 4/2, or sometimes one or two are turned off.  This paradigm is used throughout Hong Kong, especially on the 3-laners where 2 are going one way and 1 is going the other.]]></description>
