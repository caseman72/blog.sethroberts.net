		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth Great Blog!

The concern with fish oil is they are dealing with toxins and contaminants, not to mention the fish supplies in the world diminishing. Yet Mila is a sustainable resource.

Fish Oil people have a major concern with Mila from Lifemax because they market that you need the EPA and DHA that are not really essential. Here is the kicker, Mila provides ALA that is essential and supplies what your body doesnâ€™t produce, but your body converts from the ALAâ€¦the needed EPA and DHA if that was even a concern, go figure!

Dr. Wayne Coates has spent the last twenty years of his life researching Mila, perfecting it and finding the optimal growing conditions. Crops can be increased and there is plenty of land with the requirements needed.

Sincerely,

Robert and Sharri Ratcliff]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard a guy on the radio about a month ago being interviewed about this sort of thing. He had written a book, but I can&#039;t remember his name or the title. The book was about the future of medicine. 

He was very much in favor of the kind of treatment given at urgent care clinics like CareNow and others. They have a list of 35-40 conditions they will treat. When a patient comes in, they make a go/no-go decision of whether the patient has one of those conditions. If he does, he is treated according to a predetermined list of steps. 

He said that these clinics have had zero suits for malpractice. Did I hear that right? Zero? It sounds amazing. 

The author believed that it would be possible for medical knowledge to expand in the next few years so that more and more conditions could be treated like this. It would bring costs down and free up hospitals to treat more difficult cases. 

If anyone knows the name of the book/author, please chime in.]]></description>

Too bad they are not being discussed in the current debates here in America.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I still think you may be missing a larger point about Diamond: he has lost his confidence in technology (i.e. &quot;new ways of doing things&quot;) as a solution, because of 1) its track record of unintended consequences, and 2) time has run out for it. See Chapter 16 of Collapse. His pessimism seems to go so far as to make any status-quo resistance irrevelant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see any reason to dump on Diamond here.  Tracing out the paths to destruction of a series of societies is instructive by itself.  Speculating on how each might have been saved would not have strengthened his book.

		<description><![CDATA[Steve G., no Jacobs doesn&#039;t mention Toynbee anywhere, as far as I know. I completely agree about health care and global climate change. And I agree about lumping them together: If a society is too status-quo-oriented in one area, it is likely to be the same way in other areas.  America&#039;s response to the financial crisis is a third example: the underlying features that caused the crisis are still there because there is a strong bias against change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of random thoughts: 
1. The Jacobs position sounds somewhat like Arnold Toynbee&#039;s theory of &#039;challenge and response&quot; from his A Study of History. Does she cite him? 
2. Issues of response to rapidly rising health care costs and global climate change, to name just two current issues, seem to me to illustrate this problem. Entrenched interests and commitments to established ways of doing things seems to prevent needed action to avert looming--perhaps catastrophic-- problems.]]></description>
