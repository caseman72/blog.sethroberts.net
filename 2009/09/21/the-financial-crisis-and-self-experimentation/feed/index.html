		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve always had wishful thinking.  It doesn&#039;t explain the collapse.

Certainly some people understood what was going on, but it didn&#039;t matter.  What mattered was that it was in no one&#039;s interest to pull the plug.  Anybody in a position to have any effect and tried would be replaced instantly by somebody who wouldn&#039;t.  In effect, they constructed a machine that could not but proceed to the state it reached.  The only way to fix it is to give the machine different operating rules that keep it from getting there again.  What individuals understand or want has no effect unless the machine is programmed to respond to them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great points, Seth.

As Nassim Taleb says, the &#039;elephant in the room&#039; for our economic system is still debt--we are still leveraged too thin--and the &#039;elephant in the room&#039; for our healthcare system, as Michael Pollan also recently said, is nutrition. 

We need debt detox and nutrition rehab: self-experimenting with nutrition would hopefully lead people to discover a bricolage of diet-based preventions and even cures to chronic illness problems. Namely, folks would hopefully stumble upon &#039;good bacteria&#039;, would detox from sugar and &#039;ditto foods&#039; (goodbye, metabolic syndrome), and would convert their personal health &#039;debt&#039; (inflammation and disease) into equity with high market value (thriving physiologies).

Nassim calls for the conversion of debt into equity.

I call for the parallel move in healthcare.

We need detox in both spheres.

Self-experimenting exposes us to positive Black Swan opportunities.

Cheers,

Brent]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Professor Shiller of Yale, in Irrational Exuberance, talks about a fundamental mistake that investors make (especially retail investors); it&#039;s call magical thinking (essentially wishful thinking).  it&#039;s why most retail investors think they can pick individual stocks and compete against professional investors in a zero sum game.  this magical thinking apparently is at work in all areas.  
  It occurs to me that given the cacophony of information some people unconsciously avoid trying to sift through all of it, and just fall back on what they want to believe, i.e., magical or wishful thinking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you that people do overrate their understandings. But I don&#039;t think the financial crisis was brought by people who didn&#039;t understand the financial market. I believe that deregulation is responsible for it. The governing institutions didn&#039;t understand the strategy utilized by bankers and the leverage ratio has gone beyond a safe level. That may be the key reason.]]></description>
