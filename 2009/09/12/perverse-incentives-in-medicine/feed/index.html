		<description><![CDATA[that&#039;s a great great story, dgm

and that&#039;s a very good point, Dennis. It&#039;s been said that without being wildly overoptimistic nothing would get done because everything turns out to be so difficult. Without wild overoptimism nobody would start anything.

too bad there isn&#039;t a third type of doctor: satisfaction guaranteed. No pay unless the problem is solved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My PCP started out determined to discover what had been causing me to suffer mysterious wild twitching in my legs and chest muscles, preceded by migraine auras without headaches, and only at night.  He listened patiently, asked a lot of questions, looked at notes I&#039;d kept, really puzzled over it. He even called me a few times to get more info. He seemed genuinely intrigued.  Then he decided to start me on Requip for Restless Legs Syndrome even though, as I noted to him, my symptoms were inconsistent with RLS.  &quot;Yes, but if it doesn&#039;t work we can rule it out,&quot; was his response.  Well sure, we could spend a lot of time ruling out different drugs!

Instead, I obtained all my medical records from the various doctors I&#039;d seen over a few months (all of whom were mystified, including a Stanford-trained neurologist), reviewed my notes about the occurrences--time, severity, foods I&#039;d eaten, etc., did a lot of Googling, and solved the problem myself.  Turned out, blood tests had shown my magnesium was low so I . . . started taking magnesium. Problem solved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Kaiser-type doctors will be happy to tell you that they don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on, but then they&#039;ll quit trying to find the answer. At Kaiser, if you don&#039;t fit their algorithms, you&#039;ve got a problem. The for-profit docs will keep trying so long as you&#039;re paying them.]]></description>
