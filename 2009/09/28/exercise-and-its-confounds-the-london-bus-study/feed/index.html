		<description><![CDATA[Just last week I had read about studies of bus drivers and hypertension, work by Berkeley&#039;s Lenonard Syme, that highlights those confounding factors. Here&#039;s a brief excerpt:

Syme points to his study of hypertension
in San Francisco bus drivers as an
example of how easy it is to miss the
forest for the trees. While investigating
the unusually high rates of hypertension
in this group, the research team found
that bus drivers also complained of back
pain and gastrointestinal and respiratory
difficulties. The team designed interventions
to address these issues, but none
were effective. Then the researchers
learned more about the bus driversâ€™
daily routine. Drivers had to adhere to a
rigid schedule that was determined by
a computer, and they were penalized
for late arrivals. However, there was a
shortage of buses, which meant drivers
often were not given enough time to
get from one stop to the next. They
raced into fast food restaurants for
meals to stay on schedule. Because
they were so often late, they faced irate
passengers and traffic problems daily,
and often did not have time to return
home between morning and evening
shifts. The problem, says Syme, was
that the researchers were focusing on
the specific diseases rather than the
fundamental problem: the job.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was thinking of those confounding factors while reading your blog, too. I thought of one more that I&#039;m surprised you didn&#039;t mention: seeing faces/social interaction.

Bus drivers are notoriously asocial (at least all the ones I&#039;ve encountered were). They generally don&#039;t even make eye contact with passengers getting on and off the bus (except when looking in their rear-view mirror). The ticket collectors, on the other hand, were engaged in highly social interactions. Even if they only actually talked to one out of every 10 or 20 or 50 passengers, that would be quite a bit of social interaction for a day.

This blog brings to mind Taleb&#039;s statement about how much things we don&#039;t see matter just as much as, if not more than, things we do see. The researchers (and journalists reporting on the research, and readers reading the media reports on the research) all see the difference in activity, but they don&#039;t even consider all of the co-varying factors that could also account for some or all of the differences in measured effects (in this case heart attacks).]]></description>
