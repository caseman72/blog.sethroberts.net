		<description><![CDATA[Dave, that&#039;s a very interesting comment. In my experience, to test Theory X you can never arrange a pure test: a test of Theory X and nothing else. You need several additional assumptions, which I&#039;ll bundle together and call Theory Y. So what&#039;s tested is Theory X and Theory Y taken together. If the prediction of the combined theories is false, you tend to say Theory Y is at fault. At least you consider that possibility. Only after the predictions of Theories X and Z, X and A, and so on (tests based on other supporting assumptions) turn out to be false do you start to believe Theory X is wrong. It might be ironic, but it&#039;s reasonable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;d be interesting is to see the data broken down by how often a person uses a cell phone.  I imagine we&#039;d see those who use their phones only every now and then for short calls would have less brain cancer due to hormesis.  Here&#039;s to being an antiosocial guy:)  Now if we just knew where the dose response peaked:  &quot;Sorry honey, I&#039;m going to cut you off; I&#039;m over my allotted radiation regime for today.&quot;]]></description>
