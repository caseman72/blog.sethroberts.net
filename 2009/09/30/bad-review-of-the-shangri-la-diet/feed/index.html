		<description><![CDATA[[...] Second, self-experimentation allows researchers such as myself to do innovative research in some area without getting permission from experts in that area. Self-experimentation is very cheap; no grant is required. A self-experimenter can be as heretical as he cares to be. My research on weight control has been breezily dismissed by nutrition professors, for example. Obviously they wouldn&#8217;t fund it. The Animal Care and Use Committee at UC Berkeley turned down my application to do rat research about it &#8212; my ideas couldn&#8217;t possibly be true, they said. My research on mood isn&#8217;t just utterly different than what clinical psychologists and psychiatrists say to each other in meetings and papers; it also, at first glance, sounds absurd. Self-experimentation allowed me to do it. That&#8217;s another sort of filtering: control of what research gets done. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Surely the fact of whether it works trumps any amount of theorizing about why it ought to work, or ought not to work.  If you&#039;re really a scientist, anyway.  This professor reveals he is no scientist.  There should be consequences for that, if you&#039;re in a position meant to be held by a scientist.  There are plenty of real scientists looking for work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried e-mailing you, but the domain shrangiladiet.com doesn&#039;t apparently exist, so I&#039;ll just paste my idea to you here:

You&#039;ve written interesting stuff on how we should get bacteria to feed
our immune system. Have you ever thought what a great way to get
bacteria it is to eat your fingernails or the skin next to them?
Whenever I travel abroad, I instantly get a small diarrhea because of
my habit, but after a couple of days it passes and I don&#039;t have any
problems with local foods (I travel a lot and eat a lot of shady
stuff, e.g. street vendors in small chinese rural villages).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Donâ€™t try it&lt;/i&gt;

Sure, that&#039;s the best way to stay unbiased about the topic!
I just stumbled upon this same joke &lt;a href=&quot;http://a10.idata.over-blog.com/400x550/0/01/87/11/ottopics2/4emecouv-jademedia-web.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; (in french, sorry).
BTW, it works, 4kg in 1 1/2 month, 3 spoons canola oil.]]></description>
