		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Define useful research.&quot; Good question. I mean research that is clearly useful. The saving grace of the system is that research with no obvious use turns out to be useful in an unexpected way. And the less prestigious your position, the more you are willing to do useful research. That&#039;s another way useful research gets done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just yesterday I was talking to someone who was asked to provide a biosketch for a grant application. This is an indispensable person, a programmer who holds many research projects together. But on the biosketch form he&#039;s a zero: no publications, no presentations, no grants. He has decades of engineering experience, but that doesn&#039;t fit on the form.]]></description>
