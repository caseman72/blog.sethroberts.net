		<description><![CDATA[[...] Totally healthy. This is the bigger delusion: That the average American who appears healthy is healthy. I believe that practically all Americans have grossly-impaired immunity. Their immune systems work much worse than they could. The poor performance is due to suboptimal sleep and far too little bacteria in their diet. The football player was near death because he had two infections. That&#8217;s how poorly his immune system was working. And a very high CDC official called him &#8220;totally healthy&#8221;! Apparently she has no idea that people&#8217;s immune systems can vary in how well they work. This is even worse than the UCLA medical school prof specializing in infectious disease who also failed to understand this. Schuchat is one of the top public health officials in America! Public health is about prevention! [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] More. What goes unsaid, and maybe unnoticed, in the debate about health care, is that it is hard to have decent health care (that is, decent health) when those in charge don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing. The stomach-ulcer-etiology problem is a small example of a big thing. In case I&#8217;m not being blunt enough, let me be even more blunt: This example illustrates that the average doctor, the average med school professor, and at least two Nobel-Prize-winning med school professors (not to mention those who award Nobel Prizes) are unable to correctly interpret simple facts. My previous example of the infectious-disease expert (a med school professor) who overlooked the immune system is yet another example of astonishing cluelessness. It&#8217;s hard to get good health care from people whose understanding of health is terribly incomplete yet don&#8217;t realize this. [...]]]></description>
