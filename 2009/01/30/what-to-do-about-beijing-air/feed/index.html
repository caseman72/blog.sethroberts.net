		<description><![CDATA[I bought a Blueair purifier last week--I was desperate to breathe! [The cheap little Ya Du quit and they couldn&#039;t provide a new filter immediately]  Obviously I was in a hurry--I am still  concerned that they insisted they would not accept returns unless it mechanically wouldn&#039;t work. I have used Austin Air purifiers for years. They are excellent and offer thirty days return -no-questions-asked --which is reassuring when you are spending $500. This Blueair has a polypropylene filter--{Austin Air uses hemp!} There is a faint weird smell from the supposedly clean air coming out of the purifier. Kinda plastic but vague--I wonder if anyone has any better ideas for an Air purifier or has ever heard of being allergic to the filters? I do think it is possible the damn thing has counterfeit filters--but who knows? and, how would you ever figure it out?
Maybe two cheap Ya Du would be better?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

We actually purchased Yadu per your recommendation but recently purchased our 3rd unit from Alen air purifiers.  I can honestly say there is a huge difference between Yadu and Alen (which is much better) but cant really say much about IQ cuz we can&#039;t afford it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Seth, Thanks kindly for the reply. You will help my family and I to breathe more easily I should think - I can read Chinese so will check out the Amazon site. As far as I understand about air conditioners, the filters should be cleaned professionally once a year, I guess the foam stuff he used was the right thing. Best wishes, Will Croxford]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My air filters are from Yadu. You can get a low price on the Chinese amazon site but you need to be able to read Chinese. I got the cheap air filter (1000 RMB) at Carrefour; the more expensive one (1500 RMB) I got online.
I know nothing about cleaning air conditioners, sorry.

It isn&#039;t the bacteria in the air that worries me, it&#039;s all the combustion byproducts, which I&#039;m sure are carcinogenic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Seth,

I live in Beijing and am just thinking about buying an air filter, your comments make a lot of sense, but can you tell me which air filter you bought, or any suggestions where to find out about cheaper air filters?

If it&#039;s a super hot summer&#039;s day, you have all the windows closed and the air con on full blast, can your air filter(s) keep up?

I see IQair have their own stores in Beijing now, and their website is conspicuous in its lack of price information. They seem to have their marketing to the Shunyi expat community worked out very clearly, perhaps they will have chronically asthmatic children on the next ad to really hammer home the fear factor.

Otherwise, a certain exposure to bacteria is a good thing surely, if your IQair unit gets rid of all the bacteria at home, as soon as your young kids go outside their immune systems will be less prepared to deal with all the bacteria on the street? Reminds me of the Japanese craze for sanitising everything which as far as I understood was not good for their general asthma levels.

The other thing I wonder about is cleaning air conditioners. I got ours cleaned at home last summer. I got a guy who was recommended by the manufacturer but did not actually work for them (freelance fixer) and he came and took the cover off, sprayed some foam all over the filters and left that to soak in, then topped up the coolant one one as some of it had leaked. But I don&#039;t know how to confirm what that foam was, or if it could have been an air pollutant in itself. How could I possibly know if he fobbed us off with the cheap foam version.. Just in case you have researched such a thing yourself. He charged 150RMB for both air cons which seemed cheap anyway.

sorry to rabble on but thanks if you have any suggestions for the air filter, Sincerely,

Will Croxford (Beijing resident)]]></description>
