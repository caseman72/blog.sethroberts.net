		<description><![CDATA[A follow up to what my previous comment.  I purchased/downloaded the book and have now read it.  I found it very informative and interesting and thought I would mention some things that seemed relevant/related to the content of this blog.

She does discuss her health with respect to polyphasic sleep.  She says she gets sick less often now than when she did when monophasic, though acknowledges that could be due to other changes she has made.  She says she has not had a cold in over a year, though she doesn&#039;t link this directly to her sleep schedule.  When she has gotten sick (or even felt her immune system ramping up to fight off illness) while on a polyphasic schedule, she has found a little extra sleep to be very restorative, much more so than when she was on a monophasic schedule.  That is, it takes less sleep to have the same restorative effect as she would have gotten with extra sleep while on a monophasic schedule.

Another thing I found interesting was one of the primary motivations she had for experimenting with the 20 minutes of sleep every 4 hours schedule in the first place (back in 1999) was severe insomnia and other significant sleep disorders that made sleeping very unpleasant.  She was desparate and did not want to take drugs, so the suggestion of a friend to try the &#039;Da Vinci schedule&#039; seemed worth trying.  Her sleep problems pretty much went away when she adapted to the sleep schedule, and after she returned to a monophasic sleep schedule 6 months later, they did not return.  Her theory is that making such a radical switch wipes the slate clean (so to speak) and rewrites one&#039;s sleep schedule in a strict (and stable) way.  

It was also interesting to note that when she planned to switch to a polyphasic schedule the second time, she offered to volunteer as a subject to sleep clinics and sleep-research department heads so they could investigate the adaptation process.  She was surprised when none of them were interested.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You might also be interested in taking a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puredoxyk.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.puredoxyk.com/&lt;/a&gt;.  The author of that site first did the &#039;uberman&#039; schedule in 1999 for 6 months.  Subsequently she says she has lived for 2+ years on an &#039;everyman&#039; (a core sleep at night, with naps during the day).  She&#039;s written a book (available for download from Lulu.com) about her experiments/experiences and those of others she has talked to.   That said, I don&#039;t see that she has specifically noted the effects on her health, certainly not any systematic way, except that it doesn&#039;t seem to have impacted her health in a negative way.   

Given some of your past comments on other subjects, you might also be interested in her response to an attack on Polyphasic sleep (see the right sidebar entry titled &quot;An attack on polyphasic sleep&quot;)]]></description>
