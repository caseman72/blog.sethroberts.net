		<description><![CDATA[Chinese customs recommend good sleep habits (early to bed, consistent and long) to deal with all sorts of low-level health problems that we lump together as &#039;heatiness&#039;. Common colds are often attributed to heatiness as well. For instance, I have tended to sleep late, at 2-3 am most days, and I&#039;m paying for it with an endless stream of mouth ulcers, which are another symptom of &#039;heatiness&#039;. I guess what heatiness really means is a general reduction in one&#039;s immunity. So the custom squares with your theory..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, thanks for reminding me of the tapeworm research. My interpretation is that the tapeworm was constantly excreting a small amount of foreign substances into the blood and this caused the action threshold of the immune system to be raised. So long-term exposure to foreign substances raises the threshold. Whereas the Chinese herbs, taken for less than a month are an short-term effect that lowers the threshold.

Aaron, I meant that raw milk has a lot more live bacteria than pasteurized milk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
My understanding of the literature is that raw milk, like other naturally occurring foods, actually doesn&#039;t have more of what our immune system was designed to protect against. But raw milk can be collected under unsanitary conditions allowing the promotions of bacteria. Such contaminated milk has bacteria (foreign particles) that can be unsafe for humans. But the milk itself if not contaminated does not contain dangerous compounds that our immune system would try to take care of. Pasteurization kills bacteria and thus drastically reduces the potential for consuming contaminated milk. But we must be careful to distinguish between the natural constituents of the raw milk itself and foreign contaminants.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I don&#039;t have the link, but within the past year there has been interesting research that humans with tapeworms have fewer allergies.  The researcher hypothesized that there is something in the tapeworm that suppresses immune response in the host to enable the tapeworm to stay unmolested.  The host gets the benefit of reduced allergies to pollen, pet dander, etc.

By self-experimentation, he found that a few tapeworms is the correct &quot;dose&quot; for maximum relief from allergies.  More than that and he felt sluggish.  He tried it on people who wanted to own cats but couldn&#039;t due to allergies -- it worked, and at the end of the trial, most declined the drug that would kill the tapeworm!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Health benefits derived from milk products is vastly increased when raw milk (i.e., non-pasteurized) is used. The Weston Price foundation (http://www.westonaprice.org/) describes this in detail. I&#039;ve switched to consuming raw milk and cheese derived from raw milk every day. I also started drinking Kefir which contains a compliment of pro-biotics. One thing I&#039;ve noticed is a great reduction in gas and sensitivity of the stomach.]]></description>
