		<description><![CDATA[In Copenhagen and Stockholm I noticed that older people (over 50) spke English with a distinctly Swedish accent, but many younger people spoke English with a perfect American accent.  Apparently they get American TV and movies without subtitles.  Stranger, older Swedes have a distinctly Swedish gait, but younger people &lt;i&gt;walk&lt;/i&gt; like Americans.  This was not true in, e.g. France and Italy; French people, young and old, walk in French, Italians walk in Italian.  I cannot account for the difference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a similar but not identical vein, I would suggest going a step beyond passive listening, and I would suggest forcing yourself to speak Chinese at native speed.

When I was in Korea learning Korean, my reading and writing skills quickly outpaced my ability to speak and understand spoken Korean.  Then I came across a linguistic conjecture that that the same &quot;systems&quot; that allow one to understand spoken language are involved in producing it and vice versa.

So I took the audiotapes that accompanied my language textbooks, and repeated the dialogue at the same speed it was spoken.  If I stumbled over my words or paused, I repeated the task.  I also used the written text to double check whether I was hearing something correctly.  I think the most interesting part of this is I really put very little emphasis on whether I understood what I was saying.  

I imagine you could do essentially the same thing with music, TV and movies.

I&#039;m not sure if the linguistic conjecture is necessarily true, and yeah it was pretty boring, but my spoken language production and comprehension improved dramatically.]]></description>
