		<description><![CDATA[[...] I&#8217;ve blogged about this. The virtues of this test include: 1. Fast. Takes only a few minutes. 2. Portable. Requires only a laptop. 3. Many possible answers (1, 2, 3, etc.). This reduces anticipation errors. 4. Many numbers (reaction times) per test.Â  This allows me to get a measure of variability for each session and can correct for the difficulty of the problem. Aspects with room for improvement include: 1. Speed/accuracy tradeoff. Accuracy isn&#8217;t fixed. Depending on how accurate I want to be, I&#8217;ll go faster or slower. (I aim for 95% correct.) 2. No complex actions. The most enjoyable games have a motor-skill aspect that this task does not. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, I use R on OSX. R in OSX does include getGraphicsEvent, but you&#039;re right that it doesn&#039;t appear to work. The example code in ?getGraphicsEvent throws up an X11 error.

Anyhow, thanks for the offer to send the code, and for the info on how you collect RTs with R.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, it would be difficult to post the R code. There are 20-30 functions involved. I measure reaction times using Sys.time, which provides accuracy to about 1/60th of a second. Since there are about 100 measurements per session, that provides plenty of accuracy. I use getGraphicsEvent to detect a keystroke. Unfortunately getGraphicsEvent only works with Windows. If you have other questions I am happy to answer them. 

If you know how to use R, have a Windows computer, and promise to run yourself for several days, I will send you the R workspace. But there is nothing very interesting about the code, apart from what I just said.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would you mind posting your R code for the arithmetic task, Seth? It would be particularly interesting to see how you record reaction times in R. Is there a built-in function that provides ms accurate timing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[nice work seth. very interesting. what statistics packages do u prefer? i use excel, word, spss and a few online calculators.. also, have u ever used qualitative methods for self experimentation?]]></description>
