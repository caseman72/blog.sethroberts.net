		<description><![CDATA[On electric bikes, they&#039;re expensive in Japan compared to the normal kind, so they&#039;re not that popular, but every time I see one I wonder if it wouldn&#039;t be better to have lower gears on the bike. Japanese bikes are 1 gear most of the time (at most 2 or 3). This is great for getting a workout, but if it&#039;s a strain for someone, rather than an electric bike, how about a 5- or 10- or 15-speed bike? Maybe the market is older people for whom derailleurs are technologically too complex?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By the way, I&#039;ve also seen the sweepers, but they aren&#039;t popular because they really only work well on carpet, and then only if you have expansive empty areas to accelerate them &quot;up to speed.&quot; So in other words, Japanese living quarters aren&#039;t ideal for them. In Japan you may have little paths less than a meter wide snaking through your house, with furniture or boxes or other clutter taken up the rest of the room. Small electric vacuum cleaners are more practical for reaching under all this stuff.]]></description>
