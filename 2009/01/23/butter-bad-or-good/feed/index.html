		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, butter is usually considered unhealthy for our body in general. However, we must know that there are various forms of butter, and among these forms only the refined or synthetic ones are the most harmful. Natural butter than you derive from milk directly is a rich soruce of vitamin A, and less harmful to blood vessels. On the other hand, synthetic butter usually contains additional trans-fats making it harmful for blood vessels.

		<description><![CDATA[Looking at the pile of candy and inferior tea I brought home, I too am starting to be glad it&#039;s only every 2 years in the Bay Area. Until recently it was every year. On the other hand the last show was incredibly helpful to me, it changed my thinking about probiotics and fermented foods, as I will describe in later posts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[â€œIt goes straight to your arteries.â€

Boy, I hope so. I&#039;m thrilled to have all those beneficial fatty acids and essential vitamins flowing through my arteries.

Stephan at WholeHealthSource had a great post last month describing the correlation between the rise in margarine consumption (and reduction in butter consumption) and a corresponding rise in coronary heart disease.

Correlation is not causation, of course. But this isn&#039;t the only evidence that links a reduction in natural fats and an increase in industrial fats to negative health outcomes.]]></description>
