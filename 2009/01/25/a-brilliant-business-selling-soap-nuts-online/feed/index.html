		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;No chemicals or unnatural substances are involved!
...
They are 100%, totally natural. They are organically grown and are chemical-free,
...
&lt;/i&gt;

Not to pick on these folks, but this sort of false advertising:  &quot;Natural = good. Chemical = bad&quot; is irritatingly never challenged.  

Since the process of cleaning clothing isn&#039;t wholly mechanical, we know that there has to be some chemical interaction involved.  And lo, there it is:

&lt;i&gt;The outer shell of the soapnut contains saponin, a natural substance known for its ability to cleanse and wash.&lt;/i&gt;

Interesting how saponin is a &quot;natural substance&quot;, not a natural &quot;chemical&quot; or even &quot;chemical substance&quot;. 

Now, what bugs me is this insistence that something &quot;natural&quot; is inherently good and desirable.  The oils from Toxicodendron radicans are certainly natural substances, but we generally try to avoid them, and would never wash our clothes with them.

&quot;Natural&quot; is subjective and does not mean &quot;good&quot; or &quot;desirable&quot;.  Natural substances or chemicals are not any better or any worse than unnatural ones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Second, it blends male and female tendencies. The data-analytic statistical-software number-crunching rigid-experiment side of self-experimentation is obviously male. The talk-about-my-problems side is obviously female. Likewise, Laundry Tree centers on a problem â€” choosing a good laundry detergent â€” that concerns women more than men. Yet constructing and maintaining a website is a kind of technical work that men seem to enjoy more than women. (Nowadays, I admit, it isnâ€™t very technical.)&quot;

Goes along with my line of thinking! Unfortunately, they made me resign from Harvard for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s interesting--I tend to agree men are more analytical generally, and women more comfortable talking about problems.  A possible explanation might be women point out problems they have and men try to solve them to impress women.

Women might be, perhaps not consciously, testing, so to speak, who would be the best mate, since it would be good for a woman&#039;s evolutionary prospects to be selective, while men will perhaps tend to try to demonstrate their quality through clever solutions, but their main problem would be figuring out how to pass on their genes, from an evolutionary perspective, without much need for selectivity, since they can father man children and don&#039;t need to devote resources to individual children the way mothers tend to need to, it seems.

I suppose men might be inclined to look for as many women with easy problems and low-standards as possible, and solve their problems to impress them and hopefully mate with them, whereas women might be looking for men who can solve tough problems and stick with them, to demonstrate their loyalty and provider abilities.]]></description>
