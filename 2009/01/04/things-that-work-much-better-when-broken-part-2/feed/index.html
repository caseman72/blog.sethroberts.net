		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re nearsighted (as I am) one can actually have LASIK done on one eye and be left with the ability to see distantly and read close-up at the same time.  (I think they call this &#039;monovision.&#039;)

I had assumed that this would be too risky to try, but your experience may make me reconsider this.

If you continue to experiment with monovision, please keep posting about your experience.]]></description>
