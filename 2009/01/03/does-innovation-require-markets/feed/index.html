		<description><![CDATA[I think it is silly to assume that innovation requires markets.  A Crusoe economics thought experiment would certainly show that ole Robinson would be able to create something that he had no prior knowledge of (innovation) in response to his needs.  I would think that a market usually defines voluntary relations between more than one party - so even though the market expresses needs, the fact that one has needs does not denote they exist in a market.  Since Robinson would surely be able to create something in response ot his own needs on a deserted island - innovation does not require markets - only needs.

Regular Economists cannot properly model this with their mathematical functions, so they just state things as fact without proper backup.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the correction. In the case of the &quot;markets&quot; quote, I think the guy who said it was reflecting the common belief among economists that markets are very powerful and can solve all sorts of problems. So it wasn&#039;t so much the person who said it being mistaken (&quot;silly&quot;) as it was/is most of his profession -- and if so &quot;silly&quot; is probably the wrong word. You were like the child in The Emperor Has No Clothes.

As for the &quot;economists are different&quot; quote I disagree. What she said was true -- economists do have different beliefs and starting points than anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, etc. -- and I think it&#039;s helpful to point out the differences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Seth.  You garbled the link to my blog.  It should be this:
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/08/the-statistics.html

But, yeah, the more I look at this, the more amazed I am that someone could say something so silly.  I think one problem is the system of economists and economics journalists patting each other on the back.  For example, for a silly quote by an economist about how economists are different from everyone else, see here:
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2006/11/everyone-is-fun.html

As long as people get in the New York Times for saying such things--and reporters don&#039;t question them on this sort of thing--I expect we&#039;ll keep seeing it!]]></description>
