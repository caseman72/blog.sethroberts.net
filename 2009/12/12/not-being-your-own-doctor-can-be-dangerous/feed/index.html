		<description><![CDATA[Agree with Greg - being your own advocate is not bad advice. But your claims on what was saved are exaggerated or false: 1) many stones will pass w/o treatment, some may not 2) you would do an ultrasound, not a CT first, for suspected kidney stones 3) tetracyclines or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are also commonly prescribed in addition to cipro (which by and large has a good safety record).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An FDA advisory panel just recommended  that the warning for Covidienâ€™s Optimark and GEâ€™s Omniscaâ€”drugs in the family of medications known as gadolinium-based contrast agents (DBCAs)â€”be updated to restrict their use in patients with severe kidney disease because of the potential for an increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF causes thickening of the skin and organs. GBCAs carry a strong â€œblack boxâ€ warning. This site has good information on this issue:  http://www.gadolinium-mri.com/index.htmlâ€¨]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My point is that owning your health care often means different conventional treatments, rather than none.  X-ray, ultrasound, or MRI instead of CT.  Using antibiotics other than (fluro)quilolones where possible. (Actually, I&#039;m confused why a kidney stone was treated antibiotics at all.  Even if it&#039;s associated with infection, usually getting it out is the key treatment)

A healthy lifestyle is the first step, of course, but Chinese herbs and yoga is a poor summary of &quot;being your own doctor&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that doing your own research and taking responsibility for your healthcare is important, but this is a particularly bad example.  Kidney stones have significantly different courses depending on type and size, so comparing two cases is difficult.

Avoiding unnecessary CT scans is good, but make the diagnostic alternatives clear.  Using, e.g. an simple x-ray (about 1/50 the radiation) and/or ultrasound.  Simply leaving it undiagnosed is bad, since it shares symptoms with other conditions (like bladder cancer) which do need treatment.

And the Chinese herbs need to vetted, just like any other treatment medicine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph,  my point isn&#039;t what he did to get rid of a kidney stone. As you say it&#039;s hard to tell. My point is that, at least in this case, the conventional medical treatments he was offered had big costs that many people don&#039;t know about.

Tom, no I don&#039;t know what herbs he used. He believes it&#039;s more likely that the yoga was what did it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, but being your own doctor can be dangerous, too.  Here&#039;s an interesting article from the &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt; about people who erroneously think they&#039;ve found a cure (or at least at treatment) for autism:

http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-autism-parents7-2009dec07,0,7076900.story

Allergies, fungal infections, kidney stones -- these things come and go, or fluctuate in severity.  Given the noise in the signal, and an &quot;N&quot; of 1, how is one to know that changing socks, or eating kim chee, or what-have-you is the reason for any improvement that one sees?  I&#039;d like to hear Seth&#039;s thoughts about this.]]></description>
