		<description><![CDATA[Regarding Jane Jacobs, it seems a bit dramatic to lead your paragraph with &quot;Jane Jacobs was wrong&quot; when all you&#039;re really saying is that she failed to predict the trajectory of a technology that was still pretty new when she turned 80.  Not trying to be overly-critical, but the woman was quite a force for good in the world.]]></description>

And scientists, even climate â€œscientistsâ€ are supposed to follow it.

The real scandal here isnâ€™t the snarky, infantile behavior of the CRU Team.  The real scandal is â€œscientists,â€ not just at CRU, who seem utterly ignorant of the scientific method.

Revealing on multiple levels: heâ€™s in â€œCommunistâ€ (AKA â€œNew Capitalistâ€) China, and heâ€™s communicating with us from half-way around the world.   (Even if he is currently back in the States, my general point stands about a radically-changed world.)

Oh, the power elite will fight like a rabid dog, but I think its days are numbered.

		<description><![CDATA[Look at the writings of Aynsley Kellow, a professor of politics, with a science background, at the University of Tasmania in Australia, for a discussion of how international scientific communities trade status amongst participants and how the rise of the internet has made peer review a reduced force for self correction.

http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/8/4/9/7/p184976_index.html

I wonder if anyone has looked into bias in research where there are no such backers, but where the result that the study reaches could affect ones status in ones group, ones chances for tenure, the number of parties one is invited to, the chance of group ostracization, and so on.

It seems to me that if I were in a field connected to global warming, and I was doing research that seemed to be coming to results that were counter to the mainstream, I&#039;d just try to find some other area to do research in that my skills qualified me for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I found most interesting in regard to climategate, is that in my local paper, The Vancouver Province, the only reports on Climategate were Opinions on the editorial pages, whereas reports of imminent environmental collapse were news items spread liberally through all of the news sections of the paper, therefore presumably, factual.  Now surely such speculative fiction as imminent environmental collapse is at best opinion, and reports on the contents of emails admitted by the sender to be genuine are &#039;news&#039;, ie factual - an odd perversion, indeed.

As an aside. I think there is not a scientist alive who would not do well to read Socrates (the father of induction, according to Aristotle), then Aristotle (not for his particular assertions, but for his method), then Francis Bacon for his works on induction and the scientific method, which should be followed up by a good course on ethics on the virtues of honesty and integrity. What surely has failed here, is all of the above.  What is being vindicated is capitalism - as is it applies to the market for ideas - through its proxy, the Internet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

Here is what I have learned from TigerGate:

It&#039;s like Climategate in that the truth leaked out and then started gushing out. This is a fracture in fractal math: there are a few small signs of snow drift, then all of the sudden, an avalanche ensues. 

Jime Rome, the sports commentator, likes to say this about these scandals in athletics:

&quot;Where there&#039;s smoke, there&#039;s fire.&quot;

In the case of Tiger Woods, it turned out to be a roaring Forest Fire.

The fire department has yet to contain it.

Cheers,

Brent]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another corrupt science scam which has already been discredited is the supposed epidemic of &#039;new variant&#039; Creutzfeldtâ€“Jakob disease (CJD) in the UK. 

This prion was supposed to be transferred to human from &#039;mad cow&#039;s with BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy). 

This table described the supposed-epidemic - which dominated UK public consciousness for months, with predictions of hundreds of thousands of casualties, triggered regulations which cost a fortune, caused massive changes in food consumption, killed off UK beef farming etc. 

http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm

In retrospect the most parsimonious explanation is that &#039;new&#039; variant CJD was not new, but had previously been undetected; and what the grant-beneficiaries were describing as the start of an epidemic, was merely due to ascertaining previously undetected cases. 

On the small piece of false evidence of a &#039;new&#039; disease which obtained from cattle, a vast superstructure of heavily funded and government-promoted nonsense and irrelevance was then erected. 

But here is the sacry bit. Even though the epidemic never happened, the bogus science has not been discredited. SOurces like Wikipdia still accept the bogus claims. 

Among the public BSE-nvCJD is either forgotten, or - in a peculiar way - remembered as if it was true, and as if (somehow) the epidemic really had happened. 

My take home message from this is much more pessimistic than Seth&#039;s. My interpretation is that zombie science can thrive almost indefinately, and when bogus science is exposed, most people are not really interested, and apparently learn nothing from it. 

I hope that Climategate prevents Western societies from destroying the world economy and imposing authoritarian laws - but even if this happens I doubt whether anything will be learned, and the elites will simply find another bogus excuse to impose their brand of centralized state-socialism.]]></description>
