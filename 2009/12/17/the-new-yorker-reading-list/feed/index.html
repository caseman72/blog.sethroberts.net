		<description><![CDATA[The Guardian book section in the UK has done this kind of thing every year for years (I&#039;ve seen it for at least 5).  They ask famous writers (and other famous Brits) what they&#039;ve read that they liked best in the past year.  I suspect that the New Yorker borrowed this idea from them.  It&#039;s a good one, I agree with you.  

Here&#039;s the URL from the Guardian for this year:  www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/nov/22/books-of-the-year-2009

There&#039;s mostly poets on the interview list this year, but I seem to remember more of an assortment of professions in past years.  

Re the &quot;royal we&quot;--this is typical New Yorker style (which I have read for years)--a bit &quot;twee&quot; as the Brits like to say--i.e., the New Yorker&#039;s &quot;voice&quot; has always been a bit self-amused going back to the days of Robert Benchley and Dorothy Parker when they were staff writers.l 

Seth, I&#039;m not sure why you think &quot;laser-like clarity&quot; is wrong--it&#039;s kind of a cliche in literary/film critical writing.   But now I gotta go look at the list on their website--thanks for the heads up.  Interesting about Tad Friend&#039;s typo--might not be his fault--they have underlings at magazines, y&#039;know, who do the actually drudgery.  What is interesting is that the New Yorker (of old, when edited by William Shawn--for 30 or 40 years or so) was notorious for its fact checking and attention to meticulous detail.  This is of course before the internet and blogs when the magazine was actually typeset.  There&#039;s a good book about the history of the New Yorker by the way, by Brendan Gill (can&#039;t remember the title--My Days at the New Yorker or something like that).  

To think I came to your blog to see if there was anything new about fermented food!  This is the first time I&#039;ve ever posted, but thanks for the Shangri-La Diet while I&#039;m at it.   I have very high LDL numbers.  Has your high dose of flax oil ever disturbed your LDLs?   Cause flax oil sure does help me sleep the few times I&#039;ve tried--almost too deeply in fact...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I highly recommend The Gardner Heist. Not sure what the New Yorker says, but half the fun is that it&#039;s an open ended case. By the time you&#039;re done reading, you&#039;re convinced you can come up with a plausible theory for the whodunit. The answer seems so tantalizingly close.]]></description>
