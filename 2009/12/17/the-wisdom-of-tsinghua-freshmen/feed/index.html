		<description><![CDATA[Aaron, I wouldn&#039;t say that i expect reviewers and editors to notice all ways an article could be improved -- just that they didn&#039;t notice these particular ways. But you have a point: Perhaps the editors and reviewers picked up various problems that the students would have missed. Still, I was surprised how good their critiques were. That&#039;s what I was trying to say here.

Andrew, thanks. You might be right about the subject-matter match (psychology students reading psychology articles). I never gave this assignment in Berkeley so I can&#039;t directly compare -- but I would have been surprised if more than maybe 10% of my Berkeley students made comments like this. 

Robin, you&#039;re probably right. Although the articles were not in their native language, the students were quite motivated to understand them and make comments that would interest me. I am a tough grader. They couldn&#039;t get the highest possible grade unless they told me something I didn&#039;t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you considered the possibility that the students were much more motivated to pay close attention than journal reviewers generally are? 

The students were doing this as a one time exercise, with the very immediate rewards of engagement with their peers, and with you, an encouraging professor whom they presumably respect.  Furthermore, you were listening to and respecting them for their criticism of published papers, something I suspect is not a consistent experience.

For journal reviewers, on the other hand, the task has presumably become &#039;work&#039;, and it seems likely that many individual papers simply won&#039;t be of engaging interest to them.  There is little immediate social reward for playing &#039;the game&#039; of catching faults, and indeed doing so may carry some costs in terms of increased administration.

I don&#039;t mean to suggest that journal reviewers are not taking their role seriously or professionally.  I am just pointing out that it may sometimes be the scientific equivalent of &#039;guard duty&#039;, and that to maintain a consistent level of attention to each paper could be very challenging compared to someone who is doing it for the first time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  Setting aside questions about expert reviewers, etc., I just want to say that you must be doing something right if you&#039;re getting these sorts of comments.  I wonder if it helped that you had them do &quot;appreciation&quot; before you had them do &quot;criticism.&quot;  Perhaps it also helped that they are psychology students, so they&#039;re motivated to understand psychology literature.  When I&#039;ve assigned articles for undergraduates to read and comment on in statistics classes, I don&#039;t generally get such good comments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, while your post is interesting, it seems to be based on the assumption that the &quot;experts&quot;, that is journal editor and reviewers, would catch all of the major criticisms or flaws of the manuscript during the review phase. This is not a safe assumption. I&#039;ve recognized from early in my career that if you give a draft of a manuscript to 12 people, you will get back 12 sets of partially overlapping sets of comments and criticisms. Sure there are a lot of common things picked up by the majority of reviewers, but each reviewer will invariably catch one or two flaws or see a potential confounding factor or account that all the others hadn&#039;t. It&#039;s like writing computer code. No matter how many programmers work on a piece of software, it will never be completely bug-free.]]></description>
