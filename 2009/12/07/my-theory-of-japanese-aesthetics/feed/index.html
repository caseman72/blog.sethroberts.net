		<description><![CDATA[For most of its history, Japan has been a rich country, but the one resource it can&#039;t import is space. Japanese design, at least as far as architecture and interior design go, seems heavily driven by the need to make cramped spaces functional and livable. Your theory about the aesthetic of food is interesting, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suspect the higher average visuo-spatial IQ of East Asians goes a long way towards explaining high visual appreciation and creativity in EA cultures. 

This would not fully explain a distinctively Japanese ability, if that exists. 

But the explanation of IQ subscale differences then pushes the question back to why EAs have a higher VS IQ - which is presumably some selection factor. Unless it is, as I tend to suspect, an accidental and contingent by-product of selection for higher general intelligence leading to different IQ profiles in different populations due to the contingencies of gene mutations. 

At any rate, Amerindians demonstrate the same Eeast Asian differentially-higher VS IQ than Europeans (although with different general intelligence levels than modern East Asians), suggesting that this IQ subscale differential was probably established in Asia before 15000 years ago. 

Ashkenazi Jewish higher IQ, for example, is differentially in the verbal IQ subscale (not visuospatial) (which also fits the profile of Ashkenazim achievement - which is very high indeed for many intellectual activities but _not_ for those requiring exceptional visuospatial intelligence). 

However, at around population average IQs, smallish differences in subscale IQ probably make little difference to the performances under selection  - and these differentials only become apparent as performance moves further away from the mean - performance levels which are (by definition) rarer, and also prone to regression to the mean.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating! I&#039;d want to see crude correlational data about coastlines and other variables along with possible confounds before I would necessarily &quot;believe&quot; it but it&#039;s a really imaginative smart hypothesis. I hope some creative geographer or anthropologist reads it...

I used to know someone who was a Berkeley anthropology grad student living in Japan writing his dissertation on Japanese culture... I&#039;ll try to track him down and run this past him...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The simplicity thing extends even to religion. Traditional Shinto shrines are extremely simple (see Ise Jingu, the Torii entranceways to shrines, the paper and rope adornment, etc.) Are you suggesting that the Japanese native religion (which is a form of nature worship) took this form because they eat fish?]]></description>
