I am enjoying your take on ClimateGate.  Have you seen this blog post?

Very reasonable and provides some great perspective.  I think the &quot;zooming&quot; out of the temp data make for a strong narrative.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Alarmists&lt;/i&gt; insist the sun will &quot;go down&quot;, bringing &quot;the dark&quot;, but the glare from my window has been overwhelming all afternoon.

Everyone acknowledges that the IPCC report does not take into account increased lubrication under glaciers caused by melting, which has been observed to speed up their slide into the sea.  It is therefore a strict lower bound on expected increased sea level.  

Here&#039;s a graph of reliable satellite data on sea levels: http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2009/11/copenhagen_diagnosis.php

Seth, you are really disappointing me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you think that Morner is the only person who measures sea levels, or that the IPCC didn&#039;t bother including anyone who measures sea levels?

The commission that Morner served on was a commission of the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA), and according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peoplesvoice.ca/articleprint36/10%29_SCIENCE_UNDER_FIRE_ON_EARTH_DAY_2009.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;President of INQUA&lt;/a&gt; most of its members disagree with Morner on climate change.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NASA_sea_level_change_trend.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a NASA map of recent sea level changes, which suggests that Morner is correct about the lack of recent sea level rise &lt;i&gt;in Maldives&lt;/i&gt; (which is in the bluish-green area below India), but not about the broader pattern.  You can click through to the NASA page or the Wikipedia article for more information about it.]]></description>
