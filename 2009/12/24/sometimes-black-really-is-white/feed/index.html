		<description><![CDATA[Hal,
You have simply become ketone adapted because of your high calorie, high fat, high cholesterol diet...thus your desire to eat has diminished.
You must try a burger that is 50% saturated fat.  Get the 75/25 at your supermarket/butcher and get some pure gound fat and mix the burger and the fat together.  It has a most wonderful, delicious flavor when cooked by itself or cooked in coconut oil.
And eating meat and fat and eggs fried in butter or coconut oil  is not gluttonous.  It is the most healthy diet you can eat.
Eating carbs...especially wheat products...is like eating poison....as is eating anything with sugar in it.

 Exception: salads with Olive oil &amp; vinegar and green veggies with lots of melted butter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ever since I was diagnosed with ALS this past summer, I have lived in Oppositeland too. Turns out ALS survival is maximized with a high fat, high cholesterol, high calorie diet - exactly the opposite of what is (said to be) good for everyone else. So I&#039;m putting butter on everything and having ice cream every day. I&#039;m not a meat lover but I&#039;ve been trying to eat bacon and sausage regularly, for my health. Unfortunately lately my appetite has been diminished, probably a side effect of the nerve damage, so the gluttony has not been quite as enjoyable as it was a few months ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, if by &quot;just fine&quot; you mean &quot;as well as possible&quot; I am much less sure than you that that&#039;s the case. Sleep disorders are common in America. And I didn&#039;t have a sleep disorder. I slept through the night without waking up. Animal fat made me feel more rested when I awoke.

CD, I don&#039;t grasp the difference between 180 grams in weight and 180 grams of fat. The fat weighs 180 grams. I weigh it.]]></description>
