		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great, Seth. Have you encountered a situation where you thought the letter should showcase the student&#039;s weaknesses? That is, have you had a student in your office while writing a letter and realize that he or she did not do so well, was lacking in important skills or attributes, etc.? Or do you screen out those you wouldn&#039;t write a good letter for prior to the office visit? And what if you don&#039;t know the student very well (e.g., in a class of 100 or 300) and all you have is what you see in your office, not anything about their prior performance in the course?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, your approach is much better in every way. I had well-meaning professors who misremembered details of my situation. I have to assume that if your letter of recommendation contains details that obviously don&#039;t apply to you, it does more harm than good.]]></description>
