		<description><![CDATA[i agree with Alex Chernavsky; the online course is first rate and provides long-lasting useful insights into investing.  The guest speakers were especially useful, since with hindsight they sounded a little silly.  Overall, the lectures provided a framework to structure a portfolio.  There was so much useful information it&#039;s difficult to single out just one.  But, for me, Shiller&#039;s bemusement relative to &quot;magical thinking&quot; that is pervasive in the retail investing public was especially insightful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shiller&#039;s entire course is available for download here:  http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/financial-markets/

My daily commute is about an hour long, and I recently finished listening to all of Shiller&#039;s lectures.  I can say that Greenspun&#039;s criticism is unfair.  Shiller may not be the most dynamic speaker, and it&#039;s true that the introductory lecture was particularly weak.  However, I learned a lot from the course, and I also found Shiller himself to be an intelligent and prescient economist.  Rumor has it that he&#039;s on the short-list for the Nobel prize in economics (for good reason, I think).  Meanwhile, Greenspun is best known for heading up a dot-com company that crashed and burned in a most spectacular way.  Last time I checked his blog, he seemed to have some sort of obsession with helicopters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[CCS and Peter, I thought the report of Shiller&#039;s lecture was funny. That&#039;s why I quoted it. Peter, I agree it isn&#039;t exactly incisive critiicism.

CCS, it would be name-dropping if I said something like: &quot;the other day, I was talking to Feynman . . . &quot;. I don&#039;t think anything&#039;s wrong with telling a story about how he helped me learn to think for myself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One interpretation of Mike Lin&#039;s anecdote is that the lectures are worthless. Another one is that the final just doesn&#039;t do a good job testing what students know.
I think it&#039;s common knowledge that tests are an imperfect measurement of knowledge, so that&#039;s the explanation I would pick.

Of course that doesn&#039;t change the fact that there are bad teachers out there, but at least my experience has been that most of them are good. Taking a university course is a great way to learn about a subject, especially if you take the time to ask questions.

		<description><![CDATA[Great article. The current economic crisis is a real opportunity for big state universities to rethink what they do. I suspect that there are some &quot;stages of grief&quot; involved, but I&#039;ll be curious to see what Berkeley does to reshape how it educates its students. I came to Michigan when it was already well along in dealing with a similar crisis, but I have to say that I&#039;ve never been anywhere that has been more thoughtful and experimental in dealing with these issues, although there&#039;s a lot of inertia.

Yale has always been in a league of its own, and the Schiller lecture reminds me of a history lecture I sat in on when I was looking at schools that convinced me not to go there. I went instead to a small and intense college, although I ended up having one experience very similar to the stats story cited above. I took a cognitive psychology course and because my girlfriend lived at a different school some distance away ended up missing a very large proportion of the classes. So that meant that I really had to learn the material on my own and make my own judgments about what was important and how the instructor would assess it. I ended up doing very well in the course (the instructor, who was a terrific teacher, didn&#039;t hold a grudge), and it was a very useful experience.

I&#039;ve found that it&#039;s really hard to predict who will get what from an educational experience, and even hard to know what will resonate many years hence. The message I take from this is that our responsibility as faculty is to provide students with challenges and opportunities to think and learn about a broad range of important questions. In fields like psychology, that&#039;s pretty easy to do, but it&#039;s also pretty easy to forget that that&#039;s the point of the enterprise.]]></description>

Logic, as taught by your friendly neighborhood Philosophy department, in my opinion/experience, has a lot to do with problem-solving. But I am not sure who else agrees with me on that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heh. Well I could have gone my entire life without knowing that Shiller is a d*che. I have never been anywhere near Yale but his book has literally saved me hundreds of thousands of dollars. If enough people read &quot;Irrational Exuberance&quot; in high school (it&#039;s easy enough for a high schooler) the tremendous suffering of the housing crisis could have been averted. The act of simply identifying the cliches that people start to believe in a bubble could go a long way to helping people avoid losing their money. 

While I agree with the author that grades given by non-objective professors (human beings) are a complete joke, IT certifications are not the model you want to look at. They are just as un-objective because they are tests written by humans. The MCSE is the biggest joke in all of IT (I have one -- years ago.) The purpose of the MCSE is for MS to be able to create a lot of admins by giving them a test that everyone cheats on so that they can say the TCO of their systems is low. Self-taught linux/unix admins make much more than an MCSE, but Linux is free and Unix is way better than Windows, so MS needs a reason for corporations to buy their products. Cheap admins are the answer. The MCSE asks arbitrary questions that reveal zero problem-solving skills, they are just canned, meaningless phrases from MS. 

If you want to know how IT certifications work, google &quot;brain dump.&quot; IT certifications are worthless because you can&#039;t measure the skills of a good sysadmin in a test where a person answers multiple-choice questions. Redhat has slightly better tests but they still need a LOT of work. 

It may be the case that there aren&#039;t easy, efficient ways to sort out who has the right skills for various careers. Universities aren&#039;t the answer and superficial tests, even if graded by a computer, aren&#039;t the answer. 

BTW I&#039;m in grad school at a supposedly good university and I have found that cheating and plagiarism are tacitly tolerated. If I didn&#039;t like interacting with some of the other students and teachers I would quit. There are a few decent reasons for me being there but it certainly isn&#039;t what it&#039;s cracked up to be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was asked to review Robert Shiller&#039;s recent &#039;Animal Spirits&#039; for an Israel based magazine called Azure. I spent a fair bit of time on the job, but Azure declined to print the piece - presumably because I thought it was a bad book: 

http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2009/06/animal-spirits-akerlof-shiller-review.html

That aside, I think that psychometrics has shown that most educational claims are bogus since heritable intelligence and personality account for so much of the variation in educational outcomes. 

http://medicalhypotheses.blogspot.com/2009/07/replacing-education-with-psychometrics.html

Therefore, coverage of specific valuable content by formal lectures plus training in specific skills via personal apprenticeship are probably what most education ought to be about (education for its own sake being a real but small minority activity).]]></description>
