		<description><![CDATA[to dan: uhhh, before you use such bombastic language (&quot;no matter what anyone says!&quot;) you might want to get your facts straight 

1. herpes is a virus.  it&#039;s DNA  actually enters the nucleus and is kept latent there by an extremely complicated and delicate RNA repression scheme. 

2. foot fungi are.. fungi.  they live on the surface of your feet.  if you bring their population down to a certain level, you can get rid of em forever.

do you have some theory on how the fungus would magically persist in an asymptomatic fashion forever?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, first off, your symptoms may have vanished, but the fungus is still there. I hate to break the bad news, but, like herpes, tinea pedis is forever. Once you have it, you will always have it. There is no cure, no matter what anyone says. 

But, with proper care, your outbreaks will become less frequent and milder. I contacted tinea pedis in my late teens. After the first few years, it&#039;s basically disappeared, because I learned the right way to take care of my condition. (I&#039;m over fifty, now.) What you need to do is wear breathable, cotton un-dyed socks. White over-the-calf tube socks work great for me. Wear shoes as little as possible, and try to have at least two pair of shoes, to trade off each day. Let those smelly suckers dry out and breathe.

When you get an outbreak, the best treatment is called a Burrow&#039;s solution. You can get Burrow&#039;&#039;s powder from your pharmacy. Mix it according to the instructions, and apply cold (I mean ice-cold) compresses, soaked in the solution and worn for as long as you can stand it, several times per day. The cold will cut the inflammation, and the Burrow&#039;s solution will dry the pustules.

Fungus thrive on warm, damp and dark places, like your feet in shoes. UV light from sunlight will help to kill many of them, and keeping your feet cool and dry will do more for your unpleasant condition than will any &quot;home remedy.&quot; It goes without saying that a good diet and lessening stress will also help out your problem.

Best of luck, and may your fungus bother you no longer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,  a very sure fire way to ride yourself of tenia pedis (latin for foot funk) is something almost no-one knows about, but I repeat, it&#039;s a sure fire way to remove it.
Garlic!!!   Take a two cloves of garlic through a garlic press, and massage the &#039;mush&#039; into the effected area for at least 5 minutes.  It sometimes requires 2 applications (the next day), but it works.  
I had the worst kind the funk for a long time, and I am no completely free of it for over 2 years now.  Before it would stir itself back up every other month.  NO MORE!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Jeff, I can&#039;t really speak to the fermenting of fish and how various types of containers affect their poison content. However, I am a brewer, so I can speak to your statement about plastic being airtight, which is incorrect. Many types of plastic containers are actually porous and will let the things inside them breath. This is why homebrew beer is only fermented in glass carboys, or very specialized plastic containers (PET3, I think, but I only use glass so I&#039;m not really sure).

So, with that out of the way, back to my foot fungus...
More socks? Really? I have a pretty good amount of socks now, and I never wear an unwashed pair. Any idea how this actually is affecting the fungus? What is the &#039;cure&#039;? Is it the fact that it takes longer to recycle a pair back onto the feet? Perhaps some fungus stays in the sock after washing but dies if it doesn&#039;t come into contact with the host for a certain period of time?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;An extreme example is that Eskimos started dying of poison from fermented fish after they began using plastic containers. Which is why I use glass jars to make kombucha. &quot;

Can you explain this?  I assume you are talking about the problem of creating botulism while fermenting the fish.  This does not have anything to do with the material of the container, but whether the container is airtight (plastic) or not airtight (the ground).  Plastic versus glass would not make a difference.

Unless you are talking about something else.]]></description>
