		<description><![CDATA[@ Nathan Myers

Could you please clarify somewhat your comment, &quot;Surprises are hazardous.&quot; ?

From the context, you seem to be saying that experimental surprises would be hazardous to continued funding of gigantic equipment -- which leads astronomers and physicists to avoid testable predictions. Have I got that right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: I didn&#039;t say Dyson was dishonest, I said his comments were meaningless.  He has been promoting magic tree-breeding for many decades.  He has inspired nobody to work on it at all, but magic trees are all he offers.  Detailed McIntyre takedowns are easy to google up.  If you don&#039;t care what they say, they&#039;re even easier to ignore.  Are you aware of the concept of selection bias?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeff: If you can point to a single prediction subsequently observed from either of the Dark Energy or String notions, I will concede utterly.  I didn&#039;t mention dark matter, but that has also not produced testable predictions, except insofar as they have frequently been able to account for anomalous observations by assuming appropriate amounts of it sprinkled about.  This might count for &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;, because it&#039;s easy to imagine cases that couldn&#039;t be accounted for by any such distribution, but I don&#039;t suppose we&#039;d hear much about those cases.  Talk of a &quot;god particle&quot; is unadulterated PR; the less said about it the better.

Seth: To ask for &quot;facts supporting&quot; a notion isn&#039;t meaningful, but successful predictions can count for a lot if nothing else predicts the same.  Engineering departments rise and fall, but people notice where actual advances come out of.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, you clearly have only a layman&#039;s grasp of astronomy and physics. It&#039;s typical for laymen to get caught up in semantics -- &quot;dark matter&quot;, &quot;the god particle&quot;, &quot;superstrings&quot;, etc -- without having the faintest grasp of what those words represent or their relevance and importance in human intellectual achievement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not a problem if 95% of the stuff doesn&#039;t get used if they follow big ideas that have a chance of success of 5% but a potential massive payoff.
It only becomes a problem when you can say with near 100% certainty of 95% of the projects when those projects are started that they won&#039;t be successful.

As a lot of fields grow with Moore&#039;s law and a good chunk of the patents come out of academia engineering works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Astronomy is the oldest of all, and astronomers are off in cloud cuckoo land chasing &quot;Dark Energy&quot;.  Physics is second-oldest, and they&#039;re off chasing Strings. Probably those problems turn largely on how much money is at stake.  Telescopes and colliders don&#039;t come cheap these days.  Surprises are hazardous.

In economics, it costs nothing to study practically anything, so it&#039;s probably the political consequences that mire them.  According to Alan Greenspan, ironically, economists in the U.S.S.R. were free to study anything they liked, because no one paid them any attention, and they had no reliable domestic data, so they studied western finance.  Paleontologists still seem admirably well connected to the data, although their poverty can make them touchy and moody.  Engineering is about as stable as any department can be, because if their stuff doesn&#039;t work, &lt;i&gt;everybody&lt;/i&gt; notices.]]></description>
