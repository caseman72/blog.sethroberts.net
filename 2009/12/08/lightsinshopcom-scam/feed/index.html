		<description><![CDATA[I had a feeling this website was just unreal! I had been looking EVERYWHERE and all the prices were the same. Not on this website! Atleast $90 to $200 cheaper, I just knew it was too good to be true! Luckily, I was waiting to buy the items when I got paid. Went to check things out tonight and Paypal had shut them down, Wow! Then I read all these comments....Did ANYONE receive what they ordered??? I&#039;m really sorry for the people who lost their money but thank you for the info, everybody!!! Merry Christmas!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been trying to order something and I keep getting that paypal is not being honored anymore.  I did not choose Paypal, I wanted to use my VISA account.  I have sent them 2 emails regarding that I wanted to place an order.  Nothing has come out of my bank account as of yet.

But when you see prices like that, &quot;if it&#039;s to good to be true, then it is to good to be true.&quot;

I just hope they don&#039;t take my money out of my account.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I made the mistake of thinking I had everything researched on this site. Yet I see this 8 hours after I have made my purchase. I replied to the contact section and my funds have been returned. I now wonder if they may have sent me something or if they just don&#039;t want the trouble before the item is supposed to go through shipping. If they were legit I will just pass them by until I can verify someone actually used them, otherwise I&#039;ll have to pay full price for the Wii.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They may very well be a scam, but have you tried complaining to them? We have a Web site that sells stuff, and (1) after you get more than about 10 orders per day, things get really confusing, even with decent e-commerce software, and you miss some orders and customer complaints, and (2) you would not believe how flaky the USPS is, losing stuff, delivering it to the wrong address, omitting tracking scans from the tracking record, and so on.

Another possibility: a backorder where they neglected to inform you they didn&#039;t have it in stock, or they deliberately keep a thin stock and put up with a certain percentage of orders being sent late.

Just as most conspiracy theories in fact usually are just incompetence, it&#039;s more likely that this is just a badly run business than some sort of deliberate master scam.]]></description>
