		<description><![CDATA[IMO the climate situation is pretty clear. Models show that it is too late to avoid disaster, as Stephen M says. However, the future is uncertain, and reality may be better or worse than this. If it is worse, too bad, but if it is better, then maybe it is not quite too late to avoid disaster. By acting now we decrease the probability of future disaster.

This message is probably too complex and subtle to be easily communicated, but it seems to be a straightforward summary of the current scientific understanding. Some people say we shouldn&#039;t trust our models, but after all they represent our best efforts to apply the collective intelligence and reasoning power of humanity towards understand the likely course of future events. We shouldn&#039;t ignore our best forecasts just because we don&#039;t like them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;reducing industrial byproducts that kill people, heavy metals, carcinogens&lt;/b&gt;

That is the real tragedy.  I was listening to people talk about climategate today.  What has always bothered me is that the predictions indicate that it is already too late to avoid disaster (which is obviously not going to happen, given that the data was cooked).  I couldn&#039;t understand the approaches, given that it was too late under the model promulgated.  They should have been advocating how to cope with the disaster that was already unstoppable.

One guy said that what they were doing was telling lies in order to get people to do something now before it was too late.

Another said they were just looking for a way to corner the grant money and the attention.

A third said they were malevolently trying to cause us to all starve to death in the dark after collapsing the international economy.

Finally, someone said they were just in the pay of those causing the real problems and being paid off to distract everyone.

I&#039;ve been thinking ever since about that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, that&#039;s a good point. I would put it a bit differently. It explains why rich psych and econ departments are hiring people who do fMRI research. Less well-off departments are not hiring such people because their research is too expensive.

intellectual yokel, thanks for the Feynman link. I can&#039;t always get YouTube here in China but next time I can I&#039;ll look at it. As for climate science, Alexander Cockburn put it well: &quot;the Copenhagen dogmata are a farce. In terms of distraction from cleaning up the pollutants that are actually killing people, they are a terrible tragedy.&quot; That&#039;s right. Trying to reduce CO2 emissions is a huge distraction from reducing industrial byproducts that kill people, heavy metals, carcinogens, and so on.

		<description><![CDATA[Whenever you write about climate science I get a little nervous for you, because eco-consciousness is the new piety and blasphemers get excommunicated from the church.

You mentioned Feynman before, have you seen this?
