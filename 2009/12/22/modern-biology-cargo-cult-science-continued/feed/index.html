Global temperature has been going up and down for quite a while. Viewed in the light of far more than a few hundred years, the last few hundred years don&#039;t stand out. For example, the Ice Age shows how much temperature can vary without human intervention.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The hypothesis of man-made global warming is a chain of evidence and reasoning, so I don&#039;t know how one could list a single fact. But I suppose a key fact is that atmospheric CO2 levels are substantially higher now than they were a couple of centuries ago. If you grant that higher CO2 levels increase temperatures (the greenhouse effect) and you grant that man is the cause of higher CO2 levels (due to burning of carbon containing fuels, and other industrial activities), then there you go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom in TX: Imagine that you somehow became convinced the Hockey Stick graph was invalid and that a more accurate best-guess view of past temperatures is that reflected by the &lt;i&gt;prior&lt;/i&gt; consensus - one that included a substantial MWP, one that seems to have been close enough to modern temperatures that we can&#039;t reasonably be sure that current temperatures are &quot;the warmest in 2000 years&quot;.

If that happened, would it change your mind about anything *else* related to Global Warming?

Because the sad truth is this isn&#039;t a hypothetical. Given enough time and persistence on your part to evaluate the arguments on their merit (rather than on the basis of who holds them), that is the conclusion you would likely reach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the encouragement, Patri and Bryan. It seems sort of pompous to write such a book. On the other hand the subject really interests me, all the ways scientists actually learn things and all the problems they face. Such as premature consensus.

I googled the title to see if anyone else had had the same idea -- and found that I had, a year ago.]]></description>

They believe science is a priesthood with priest who words must be heeded, and us wee-folk need to get in line.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: Please. Language use necessarily developed for tens of thousands of years within family groups before &quot;specialized skills increased, and trading networks grew&quot; -- or, indeed, could exist at all.  You might as well suggest that airplanes were invented to give us a place to spend all the air-miles we&#039;ve accumulated.  It should worry you to find yourself promoting such a trivially silly idea. 

Stephen McIntyre certainly is using dishonest tactics.  Freeman Dyson isn&#039;t saying anything meaningful at all. (Magic trees? Spare me.)  I&#039;m not trying to engage you at that level because you&#039;ve demonstrated again and again that you are really &lt;i&gt;not interested&lt;/i&gt; in facts in this area. &lt;i&gt;&quot;It is my mission in life to hold Laurie David accountable.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;  That&#039;s what I&#039;m taking you to task over.  Your behavior has been egregious, and is starting to border on the risible.

There is one area where you do well, and that&#039;s where you measure things personally.  In climate science there&#039;s nothing for you to measure, and you&#039;re left floundering in a sea of others&#039; statements you&#039;re not equipped to evaluate.  On language origin, no direct measurements are possible even in principle, and you&#039;re off in cloud-cuckooland.  Why not spend your time on things you&#039;re uniquely good at, instead of chasing around with Sancho Panza?]]></description>

Language use necessarily developed for tens of thousands of years within family groups before &#8220;specialized skills increased, and trading networks grew&#8221; &#8212; or, indeed, could exist at all.  You might as well suggest that airplanes were invented to give us a place to spend all the air-miles we&#8217;ve accumulated.  It should worry you to find yourself promoting such a trivially silly idea. </p>
<p>Stephen McIntyre certainly is using dishonest tactics.  Freeman Dyson isn&#8217;t saying anything meaningful at all. (Magic trees? Spare me.)  I&#8217;m not trying to engage you at that level because you&#8217;ve demonstrated again and again that you are really <i>not interested</i> in facts in this area. <i>&#8220;It is my mission in life to hold Laurie David accountable.&#8221;</i>  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m taking you to task over.  Your behavior has been egregious, and is starting to border on the risible.</p>
