		<description><![CDATA[No I haven&#039;t tried videos with 2 faces. That&#039;s fascinating that you get a stronger effect.

I think two faces is more likely to resemble the ancestral situation. I doubt people just talked to one person at a time. I imagine a few people got together and talked -- about their dreams, for example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We really need a website who&#039;s raison d&#039;etre is to organize and provide links to online videos appropriate for morning face viewing.  I have a &quot;Face Videos&quot; folder on my desktop in which I try and keep a que of such downloaded videos, but it&#039;s often in danger of running out.  Seriously, someone with web skills should start this up; once the layout was up most of the linked content could be user submitted.

Have you experimented using video with two faces?  I&#039;ve started using such videos, and have noticed a much stronger effect than using a mirror or a video with a single speaker.  

Bloggingheads.tv contains a ton of these type of videos, with two bloggers recording an hour long dialogue they have with their webcams.  On my 24 inch monitor, the heads seem to come out just about the right size when I put the video on full screen.

My theory on why it works so much better is that it simulates rich social interaction much better, with a back and forth conversation to follow, and the monitoring of how facial expressions are changing in reaction to what&#039;s being said, engaging a lot more of the brain than when I view just one face.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Seth. I like the re-phrasings, and glad you added some bulk to your answers. I will link to this later, but probably better on your blog anyway -- your readers will appreciate this more than mine.

I would still really like to see you develop the first two questions. *How much* do they improve your life and potentially other people&#039;s lives?

Thanks again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:  I&#039;m glad you posted this.  I find it so irritating when people interview me and then don&#039;t use the interview or don&#039;t even thank me for my time.  It makes perfect sense--I run lots of regressions but don&#039;t use most of them, so, similarly, an interview can gather lots of information and publish only some of it.  Still, it&#039;s annoying.]]></description>
