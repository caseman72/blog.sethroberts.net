		<description><![CDATA[My containers of yogurt spends about 3 hours in the water bath; which is close to 130F to begin.  So:  14 cups of milk in double boiler to 190F, water bath to drop to 130F, add about a cup of cold yogurt to the hot milk, mix, pour into containers, into the 130F bath.  3 hrs later into the fridge.  I guess you could say it&#039;s mild; my family says they like that.  The bath often is as low a 110 when I start.  I use a picnic cooler for the hot water bath.]]></description>
