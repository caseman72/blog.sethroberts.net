		<description><![CDATA[@Matt,
Have you tried really upping your saturated fat intake? Coconut oil is an excellent source. Try increasing the fats in your diet to 50%, most of that coming from saturated and omega-3 PUFA. Also try eliminating all grains for a month, in particular the ones with gluten, such as wheat.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth, can you do a post on eczema?  If you haven&#039;t done experiments on it, maybe your readers have?  I&#039;ve done some self experimentation, but the only thing that really clears it for a few days is swimming in the ocean.  Supplementing with Omega 3 flaxseed oil helps a little, bit but not much.  All the doctors tell me the same thing - apply steroid cream.  Googling for info on this topic pulls up a lot of spam/snake oils.  I&#039;m hoping maybe there is an easy solution, like your foot fungus cure.  Thanks!]]></description>
