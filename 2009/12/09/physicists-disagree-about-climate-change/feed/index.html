		<description><![CDATA[Seth, embrace who you are.  You have spent your entire life being a gadfly, a contrarian, and doubter.  You&#039;ve been marvelously successful at that.  But to claim that you are not pro-institutional, be real!  Your examples prove my point.  Spy magazine, green party snort.

But we are getting pulled away from the topic at hand.  My point was and is that for you to join the consensus that we have sufficient confidence about the source and the likely consequences of global warming at this point to spin up a vast and coordinated response would demand not once by twice that you create some allegiance to really vast institutions.  One the side of the consensus about sources you&#039;d have to join assent to agree with institutional science in a way that you&#039;ve spent most of your life being a contrarian about.  And to support the vast response we need to spin up you&#039;d have to work, or at least allow that it&#039;s possible, to make the institutions that coordinate those responses functional.   Both these are deeply hard given where your political center of mass is.

I am not, by choice, arguing about the merits of the contrarian arguments around the global warming consensus.  Though I consider them broadly wrong.  I am highlighting that like the majority of those who take them seriously your engagement with them runs true to your politics in ways that create what I consider an unfortunate synergy.   You all have recently gotten all into trying to play the group think card, a move that suffers a tad from projection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ted - I think you can find more productive ways to cheer on those in your tribe than trying to bait me.

Seth - My impression from reading your work and postings is that your an enthusiastic believer in the power of individuals to do good and you are deeply suspicious, concerned, and dismissive of the power of institutions to do good.   I think that&#039;s a deep and fundamental part of your world view.  Would you dispute that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, that Freeman Dyson article at http://www.e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2151 is a really good one, when it comes to seeing why people shouldn&#039;t put a whole lot of weight on Dyson&#039;s beliefs on this!  He says himself, &quot;it is definitely a tactical mistake to use somebody like me for that job, because I am so easily shot down. Iâ€™d much rather the job would be done by somebody who is young and a real expert. But unfortunately, those people donâ€™t come forward.&quot;

I also don&#039;t think I&#039;ve mischaracterized Dyson&#039;s views. That particular article doesn&#039;t emphasize his technological optimism.  He doesn&#039;t say global warming isn&#039;t happening --- indeed, he specifically says that it is: &quot;No doubt that warming is happening. I donâ€™t think it is correct to say â€œglobal,â€ but certainly warming is happening. I have been to Greenland a year ago and saw it for myself. And thatâ€™s where the warming is most extreme. And itâ€™s spectacular, no doubt about it. And glaciers are shrinking and so on.&quot; 

Dyson does say in that interview that he doesn&#039;t think most of this is due to anthropogenic effects, a claim I hadn&#039;t previously seen.  It&#039;s an odd claim, not exactly contradicting other things he has said, but close: he has said &quot;Everyone agrees that the increasing abundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has two important consequences, first a change in the physics of radiation transport in the atmosphere, and second a change in the biology of plants on the ground and in the ocean.&quot;

Check out the long article by Dyson at http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21494
Among other things, he says &quot; I consider it likely that we shall have &quot;genetically engineered carbon-eating trees&quot; within twenty years, and almost certainly within fifty years. Carbon-eating trees could convert most of the carbon that they absorb from the atmosphere into some chemically stable form and bury it underground. Or they could convert the carbon into liquid fuels and other useful chemicals. Biotechnology is enormously powerful, capable of burying or transforming any molecule of carbon dioxide that comes into its grasp.&quot;  

Or, check out the article he wrote at http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dysonf07/dysonf07_index.html in which he says &quot;If we use genetic engineering to put more biomass into roots, we can probably achieve much more rapid growth of topsoil. I conclude from this calculation that the problem of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a problem of land management, not a problem of meteorology.&quot;

In all of Dyson&#039;s publications, he emphasizes that (1) he is not an expert on climate change and does not intend to become one, (2) the climate is changing, and particularly the colder parts of the earth are warming, and (3) even major climate change will not be harmful.  In the two that I cited, he also mentions using biotechnology to remove carbon dioxide from the air.

I definitely agree with Dyson about item (1), above!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First, the dialogue is tremendously useful.
Second, I looked at the &quot;fiddling with data reference&quot; 
http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/12/08/the-smoking-gun-at-darwin-zero/
Seth referred to above and think wonder three things: 
1) How much more time do I need to figure out what the author is doing?
2) What are the confidence intervals around the 1-2 degree anomalies?
3) If he had to work that hard to find an anomaly, what is the likelihood this represents the work of a conspiracy to fool the planet into believing the planet is heating when it isn&#039;t?  Cui bono?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you could remove the statement about deaths from cold from Lewis&#039;s statement, and it would still be nonsense for reasons I have outlined.

Bruce and John: The whole &quot;Climate Change business&quot; does not hinge on computer modeling.

Bruce or John (I can&#039;t tell who said it): Freeman Dyson was an excellent mathematician and physicist, but has always been absolutely terrible as a futurist. His main stance on climate change is that the problems won&#039;t be nearly as bad as people think because technology will allow cheap and easy adaptation --- we&#039;ll genetically engineer plants to take up the CO2, or else we&#039;ll adopt special planting methods over virtually the entire surface of the earth to recapture in biomass what we are putting out through burning fossil fuels...and this will be cheap and easy and won&#039;t have negative side effects (yep, seriously. He proposes that we increase the rate of plant growth by an average of 1/10 of an inch per year over the entire surface of the earth).
 
Dyson is, and has always been, a technological optimist to an almost incredible degree.  For instance, he thought in the 1950s that we would land people on Mars by the mid-60s (using nuclear-powered spacecraft), and that we would send people to the outer solar system by the 1970s.  Please allow me to revel in the irony of someone who says not to trust predictions of complex systems, especially if they don&#039;t have a track record of success...but then cites the authority of a man with a 60-year track record of failure who predicts the progress of technology far into the future and, on that basis, claims that adapting to climate change is going to be a piece of cake.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[posted for Bruce Charlton:

The whole Climate Change business hinges upon computer modelling:

This is John Wixted of UCSD :

&quot;To think about the relationship between CO2 emissions and global warming, the most important step to take is to imagine that scientists had never invented climate models that presume to predict the future.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth asks: Phil, can you explain why Lewis â€” who surely understands physics at a better-than-grad-student level â€” has the views he has? Not the view that warmth is good for people but the other views.

I reply: No.  To ask me to explain why someone else has the views that they have, based on a single paragraph of nonsense...you&#039;re asking too much of me. 

Seth asks: You donâ€™t see a problem when you argue based on what any physics grad student can do and I give an example of a physics professor who disagrees?

I reply: First, I have to correct you on a minor point.  What I&#039;m claiming that any physics grad student can do is to calculate things like: what would the earth&#039;s temperature be if it had the same albedo that it actually has, but no atmosphere?  What would the earth&#039;s temperature be if the amount of CO2 were doubled but nothing else changed?  This latter question is what I meant by the &quot;first-order&quot; problem. 

I see no evidence that Lewis would have any problem solving those problems. I do not think Lewis would disagree with these calculations.  Perhaps he would --- maybe he lost his physics chops when he retired --- but I doubt it.  

But I think you&#039;re intended point isn&#039;t to ask about those specific calculations, it&#039;s to say &quot;do you think there&#039;s a problem when a presumably intelligent physicist who claims familiarity with the issue disputes anthropogenic global warming?&quot; If that&#039;s your question, then yes, I do see a problem. Two problems.  But I think the problems I see are different from the one that you see.   

The first problem I see is that this guy is just not thinking clearly about this subject. He says that even if global warming happens as expected it will be good because fewer people will die of cold, as if that&#039;s the main expected effect.  He says global temperatures are not in fact increasing, which is simply false.  He says CO2 is a greenhouse gas (meaning it absorbs and re-radiates infrared radiation) but that as for trebling or quadrupling its atmospheric concentration &quot;no one knows&quot; if that affects temperature.  These are just not reasonable statements, whether they come from a physicist or someone else.  

The second problem I see is that some intelligent people think these unreasonable statements are in fact reasonable!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That Hal Lewis quote is a really good one for the purpose of contrasting the two viewpoints.   I just don&#039;t see any part of Lewis&#039;s quote as &quot;reasonable&quot;. 

For instance, the statement that continued warming is more likely good than bad because &quot;people die of cold, not warmth&quot;...I&#039;ve just typed and deleted four different responses because I am having trouble coming up with anything other than an insult.  There may (or may not) be an abstract sense in which a warmer climate would be better.  But the fact is that the manmade world (and the terrestrial ecosystem) is highly optimized to the current climate.  Reservoirs are built where the rain falls. Coastal cities, towns, and houses are built at an appropriate location for the current ocean level.  To suggest that the major effect of warming is that fewer people will die of cold isn&#039;t just wrong, it is _obviously_ wrong.  It&#039;s _ridiculously_ wrong.

And as for the claim that change is &quot;almost certainly not&quot; too big for &quot;normal adaptation&quot; to handle...well, that obviously depends on what &quot;normal adaptation&quot; means, and also on how much change we are talking about. Considering Levin doesn&#039;t think the temperature is changing much at all --- he says so a few sentences later --- well, if you believe that then I guess you can believe that &quot;normal adaptation&quot; is going to do OK.  But that&#039;s arguing from a false premise: temperatures are going up, and going up fast. (And global warming isn&#039;t just about temperatures, it also affects rainfall patterns and storms and so on).  It&#039;s not clear if Levin (or you, Seth) would agree that if climate change is very large and rapid, &quot;normal adaptation&quot; would suffice?  I hope you would agree that there is _some_ magnitude of climate change for which &quot;normal adaptation&quot; would not be enough.  

Lewis says increasing temperature causes an increase in CO2 rather than the other way around, and that &quot;the disobedient temperature seems not to care very much&quot; about increasing levels of CO2.  Confusingly, he also says that CO2 is a greenhouse gas.  But it&#039;s hard to interpret these statements as anything other than a denial that increasing levels of CO2 lead to an increase in temperature.

So, I think this entire Lewis quote is something very close to nonsense. The fact that you, Seth, say it is &quot;reasonable&quot;...I just hardly know what to say.

Moving on through your post: you insert a comment in my quote, that I &quot;seem to miss the point here. The usual claim is that man-made warming is large relative to other global temperature changes. Thatâ€™s not predictable â€œby any physics grad studentâ€ and to call it a â€œdetailâ€ is misleading.&quot;  

First, that is not the usual claim.  The usual claim is that man-made warming is large enough that it may be catastrophic.  I&#039;ve never understood the importance of comparing it to historical variability, unless you are one of the people who believes anything natural is good. (Malaria? Smallpox?).  Even if we had some philosophical agreement that anything natural is good, it wouldn&#039;t necessarily follow that something unnatural, but of the same magnitude as a natural effect, is good.  If we agree that it&#039;s a good thing that people die of the flu --- culls the herd, and all that --- it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that if I go out and kill 10,000 people, I&#039;ve done a good thing.  

Second, it is not &quot;missing the point,&quot; nor &quot;misleading&quot; to say that any grad student can do the first- and second-order calculations of the magnitude of a change.  This is important because there are people out there who claim that the whole concept of any human-caused influence on the climate is a scam.  Ironically, and seemingly contradicting my claim about any physics grad student, you just quoted a physicist who apparently believes the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere does not affect global temperatures!  In your post, you have simultaneously proven the relevance of my point, while also apparently disproving my assertion. Actually, I&#039;m sure Lewis is capable of performing the calculations; he presumably is sure (why?) that effects beyond the first orders are big enough to cancel out the leading terms.

I&#039;m just at a loss. You people are nuts!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s always a bad sign when new data only confirms what you already believe, especially on a controversial issue.

Yet of course you will think you are right, because if you didn&#039;t, you would change your opinion. So the great majority of people think they are right, but are at least slightly wrong.

If you, too, find the new data only confirming what you already believe, it is overwhelmingly more likely that you are committing this logical error than that you were in the lucky minority that happened to be right before.
