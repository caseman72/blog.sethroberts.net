She only washes her face with salt( of course with water also..) &amp; I can say that her face is flawless ( like baby&#039;s skin) . She only gets a zit when she has her period though but her skin is flawless most of the time o.o]]></description>

&quot;Crohn&#039;s disease and early exposure to domestic refrigeration.

BACKGROUND: Environmental risk factors playing a causative role in Crohn&#039;s Disease (CD) remain largely unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. We thus conducted a pilot case control study to explore the association of CD with the exposure to domestic refrigeration in childhood.

CONCLUSION: This study supports the opinion that CD is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household factors, during childhood.&quot;

Also, this http://www.pnas.org/content/105/43/16413.long &quot;Therapeutic correction of bacterial dysbiosis discovered by molecular techniques&quot; states that &quot;Molecular analysis of fecal and mucosal samples have increased culture-based estimates of 200â€“300 individual colonic bacterial species to as high as 1,800 genera and 15,000â€“36,000 species (7). &quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, standard advice is to never use soap, never use bar cleansers of any type because solids leave behind residue that is hard to wash off that irritates the skin, and to not use any type of cleanser more than 2 times per day because it dries.  Instead, the recommendation is to use a gentle liquid cleanser such as Clean and Clear, Cetaphil, Suave&#039;s facial cleanser, or a few similar ones, as simple as possible, no additives and clear in color if possible, and never anything that tingles because that means the skin is being irritated.  See Paula Begoun&#039;s book.  

I got rid of my acne based on clinical trial results.  Initially I was using benzaclin, a prescription cream that is a mixture of antibiotics and 5% benzoyl peroxide.  It worked well but I read the package insert and noticed that the t was barely significant between the prescription and just plain 5% benzoyl peroxide, so I started using just plain 5% bp and that was equally effective, though slightly more effective because it was cheaper by an order of magnitude so I felt okay using lots of it.  I buy it for $2 a tube online, versus $20 as my prescription copay.

There was a self-experimentation aspect, in that I started using the benzaclin in large amounts because I noticed it was close to the end of its effectiveness date and I wanted to use it up, and it was more effective that way.  Turns out that using a lot of b.p. is a common way to get rid of acne, as a guy who owns acne.org turns out to have also &quot;discovered&quot; the same thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Could the washing with soap be changing the ratio types of bacteria so that the acne bacteria runs amok? Sort of like the inverse of your fermented food idea.

		<description><![CDATA[Self-experimentation is the only way to deal with acne, IMO. All the standard advice (wash more, it&#039;ll go away when you&#039;re older, use acne cream, don&#039;t pick at it!) is totally useless. I discovered long ago that I did better by not using soap on my face. And later, I used the RPAH elimination diet to experiment until I pinned down the remaining causes of my acne: wheat and chocolate. My face has been wonderfully clear for a couple of years now, except the two or three times I have been lured into eating baked goods over the holidays. But talking with other people who&#039;ve eliminated their own acne... not everyone&#039;s acne is caused by the same things. So since there&#039;s no uniform cause, it&#039;s a cinch there&#039;s no uniform cure either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, as with so much else in life, there&#039;s often a tradeoff between how sure an experimenter wants to be and how much effort and resources the experimenter is willing to commit to that certainty. The method I presented was merely an answer to Mickey&#039;s desire to rule out the influence of confounding factors with only one research subject, at the expense of simplicity for that subject&#039;s experience.

I&#039;d be impressed if anyone has a method that works for undisciplined self-experimenters who are neither prone to the organization to randomize and record their washing habits or routine to stick to either method for any length of time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi all--

Seth: They keep fermented foods out of the diet for the first phase because your gut is irritated and is leaking food into your bloodstream, which causes problems in other areas of the body. The theory is that fermented foods (or even just acidophilus) will irritate you further until you kill the yeast and heal your gut--at which point, they will become essential. (Spicy foods are prohibited too, for pretty much the same reason.)

NNM: I have an *extremely* good doctor who I started seeing only about a year ago--and he spotted this during a chat about something else completely. The interesting thing is that I had discussed many of my yeast-related symptoms with other doctors over the years--including acne, terrible reactions to birth control pills (including anxiety and mood swings), allergic reactions to allergy medications (steroids), persistent stomachaches that weren&#039;t helped by stomach remedies. But the doctors had no answers, and I felt these were annoying rather than important ailments. Really, I thought of myself as a very healthy person.

I was in for something else and my doctor was prescribing me an antibiotic, so we were discussing any other medications I was on (none), compared to what he&#039;d prescribed me in the past. The trigger was when he asked how I was doing with the low-dose Prozac he&#039;d prescribed to treat PMDD. I told him I&#039;d used it for about two months, but that the issue had gotten much better when I removed white flour and white sugar from my diet. Then he started looking at my reactions to medications and some of my medical complaints, and realized they formed a pattern.

Most doctors don&#039;t do this or listen anywhere near as closely. A friend of mine has gout, which his doctors tell him is triggered by red meat, organ meats, and wine. In his experience, though, it seems to be triggered by sugar, and not at all by those other things.]]></description>

<p>Most doctors don&#8217;t do this or listen anywhere near as closely. A friend of mine has gout, which his doctors tell him is triggered by red meat, organ meats, and wine. In his experience, though, it seems to be triggered by sugar, and not at all by those other things.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy, in practice much simpler designs work fine. For example, suppose you have recorded your acne daily for six months. You stop using soap and all of a sudden the measurements go much lower than usual and stay there. That&#039;s almost proof right there. If after a few weeks you resume using soap and then the acne comes back, that&#039;s all a sane person would need.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In response to Mickey&#039;s comments about controlling for confounding variables, the less time-expensive solution is randomization, just like with larger clinical trials. For the acne case, the self-experimenter could flip a coin at the beginning of each week to decide whether to wash their face using or not using soap and record results at the end of each week. Any variable not connected with the presence or absence of soap has an equal chance of acting in any given week. If any unknown variable correlates with the use of soap, who cares? The experiment is less interested in proving or disproving &quot;Washing without soap causes less acne&quot; than demonstrating that &quot;there&#039;s less acne when washing without soap.&quot; Further, such self study may demonstrate a solution that works for an individual, but may not work for a larger population as would be necessary for a definitive conclusion from a clinical trial. The trouble with the randomization I described is that it requires that the self-experiment be both disciplined and organized, but flexible enough to not fall into a routine â€” but alternating 6-month samples fails to control for seasons as a variable, so that&#039;s one for one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I&#039;m a bit of a counter example to the &#039;wash with water&#039; acne cure. In my teens and 20s I had terrible acne over my face, chest and back. My face and chest were washed daily with soap (in the shower), but never my back, which was only rinsed by water. The acne was pretty much the same everywhere. Nothing much helped it till I took a course of accutane in my mid-20s.]]></description>
