		<description><![CDATA[I lived and studied in Russia twice for a total of over a year, and never had a gut or stomach problem.  A number of fellow foreigners had such issues (especially if they drank the municipal tap water or ate street food).

Though I might just have a strong system (I would later eat street food in India with impunity), I still credit my health during those times to the fact that I had plain kefir every day, at least two to four servings of it (a marvelous food, and can be found pretty much at every convenience store or grocery or market in Russia).   I didn&#039;t eat it for the protective use, but I loved the taste of it -- nothing like it in the USA.
And I consumed a fair share of tap water, to boot.]]></description>
