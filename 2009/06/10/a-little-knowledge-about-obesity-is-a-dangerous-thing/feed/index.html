		<description><![CDATA[Wilbur -- yes, the daily weight variation is often quite substantial. To smooth the fluctuations, I&#039;ve been calculating a Trend value, using simple exponential smoothing algorithm: Trend_(n) = 0.1*Weight_(n) + 0.9*Trend_(n-1).

		<description><![CDATA[Clearly the obesity professionals have not thought the matter through. Losing three pounds in a month is no big deal. I find that my weight can fluctuate a couple of pounds over the space of a day, so being down three pounds in one month is very possible, even doing nothing at all. The professionals should be saying, &quot;Hmm, that&#039;s nice, but let me know how you&#039;re doing a year from now&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sometimes there seems to be an inverse relationship between a particular medical establishment&#039;s ability to make progress in treating its given problem and the vehemence with which it rejects alternative methods of treating that problem.  If any field should be open to new treatment ideas it should be the mainstream obesity establishment, as it has been singularly and embarrassingly unsuccessful at reversing obesity.]]></description>
