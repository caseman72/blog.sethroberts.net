		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had a rotten attitude about college. I avoided it, got a minimal degree via mostly correspondence and portfolio assessment, blah blah, mainly because I didn&#039;t want to give money to someone for learning, when they wouldn&#039;t take that job seriously.

Being older and wiser now I&#039;m sure I overreacted, but this sure brings back the old feelings.

And I didn&#039;t need to be entertained, but for several deca-kilo-bucks, I expect you to take me seriously. The universal attitude among professors is that I&#039;m asking too much. Or maybe that I&#039;m paying for something other than the teaching?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm...that&#039;s a funny way to look at it. I never think of being a good teacher as demeaning myself to my students. I take pride in what I have to offer, and humbled by how often a student can ask a question that makes me realize my limitations. I view that as a challenge rather than an obstacle or weakness. Anyway, I get the impression that it is more common for other faculty at UCLA to feel like me about teaching rather than like the way you portray Berkeley professors. I prefer and enjoy research to teaching, but I realize that teaching keeps me grounded, humbled, and motivated and excited all at the same time. I guess part of it also comes from my viewing teaching as story telling (non-fiction, of course) and every story teller loves an audience. I wonder if the UCLA students have a better learning experience than do Berkeley students?

I&#039;m glad you didn&#039;t blow the job at Berkeley with your honesty.]]></description>
