		<description><![CDATA[It would be great if there was some sort of &quot;game&quot; for a phone like iPhone or Blackberry that would satisfy your 5 criteria and would keep records that could be transferred to a computer for statistical purposes. This would be especially good with a portable gadget because, obviously, it&#039;s sometimes not convenient to be near a computer, and also these portable gadgets all have alarms etc. to remind you to take the game/test. I wish there was something like that for iPhone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am curious, how do you account for the fact that practice will make you better at tasks, especially hand-eye coordination heavy ones, over time?  

Thanks for the great site.

		<description><![CDATA[i had candida and tried Nystatin; but found that citricidal (grapefruit seed extract) works better, and you can stop taking it after the candida clears.  it&#039;s awful tasting so you may have to put in a capsule with some sort of filler.  It also is suppose to have anti-biotic and anti-viral properties.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know about the candida product but my Autism kids get really hard to manage when they are off Nystatin for a few days. If I knew of a cheap easy to get fermented food I could convince them to like I&#039;d feed them a ton of it.

Rock Band 2 song drumming meets some of your criteria. It&#039;s wildly fun, can be _really_ hard, and if you finish a song it&#039;s graded numerically with longest streak or correct notes and percent of notes correct.

Unfortunately it&#039;s 3-5 minutes for just two numbers and it takes a minute or two to get set up. I&#039;m thinking of plotting fish oil vs. my scores, because I&#039;ve noticed that some days I can finish really difficult songs on the hard (not expert) level. Then another day I&#039;m kinda klutzy, miss too many notes and fail out of a song a beat just a few days ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: Off topic (I seem to have lost your email address), but have you heard of something called ThreeLac? http://www.threelac.com/

It&#039;s a probiotic, a mixture of three bacteria, none of which are found in the usual probiotics, and testimonials, e.g. on Amazon, are over-the-top. Many people claim that it completely restored their health, in particular by killing Candida and healing leaky gut.]]></description>
