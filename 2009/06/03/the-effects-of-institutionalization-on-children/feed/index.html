		<description><![CDATA[Statistics as you guys know can be skewed to say what you want them to say. I was a ward of the state... institutionalisation of any sort messes with your life. You don&#039;t need a study to tell you that. My experience says &#039;Institutions do not teach you how to live, they teach you what you must do to survive&#039;. This is not living. Oh Seth, children are not lovaves of bread as you so eloquently put it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the number of kids in each of the three groups (52, 59, and 59) are not any kind of random sample. They are set by convenience. By what the experimenter wants. Just as when you go to the store the number of loaves of bread you buy is your choice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There was a probability of having ever been institutionalized _within_ the study group, 111 kids out of 170. (65%) And within the study group there was a 75% chance of having disorders from the control and experimental groups combined. From the figures given you could play sudoku and fill in a table with the groups and disorder variables and probabilities the results were disappointing.

Anyway, I&#039;m totally not good at this and you are I&#039;m sure quite busy. Thanks for replying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[sorry, I have no idea how you got 75%. There is no &quot;probability of being institutionalized&quot; given in the abstract. Perhaps you are interpreting one of the numbers incorrectly.

The &quot;control&quot; number (22%) is higher than what you&#039;d get if you got a random sample of non-institutionalized kids -- that&#039;s what I&#039;m suggesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok. I think I see it. The 75% number means not much. That shows that 75% of the kids in the study had the disorders, but that&#039;s skewed because the control group was smaller than the experimental group. The fact that two thirds of the control group had the disorders was still noteworthy. So I tried seeing if the probability of having the disorders times the probability of being institutionalized would be very different from the 53% they quoted in the study. I got about 48% which is only different by 5%. I don&#039;t know how to take the difference and interpret it as the two variables being dependent or not.

Perhaps I am only revealing my ignorance. Anyway, fun puzzle to try to research and interpret.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Help an idiot here. I tried to plug their numbers into a Bayes theorem table using their result. I that by their result 75% of of all children have internalizing disorders. Also, in their control group, twice as many had internalizing disorders vs. those that didn&#039;t.

Is that what you are getting at with the &quot;high&quot; control number?

Of course maybe I just did it wrong.]]></description>
