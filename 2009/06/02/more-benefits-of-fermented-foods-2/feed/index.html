		<description><![CDATA[Just Google &quot;fermented noni juice,&quot; or go to a local whole foods or similar. There are a lot of brands of noni juice out there. Just read the label carefully to make sure it&#039;s fermented, as some aren&#039;t.

Getting good at reading between the lines of labels is a useful skill in any case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And here&#039;s a link to a study about the probiotic potential of fermented noni juice.

http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a910157735~db=all~order=pubdate

I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just a coincidence that fermented noni juice would be more expensive to make, as it has to sit and age for a time. So if you wanted to sell larger quantities of juice (through an MLM for instance) you might suggest that the fresh juice is better...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now I&#039;m remembering that there is a controversy in the noni-juice biz about fermenting vs. non-fermenting. The non-fermenters claiming there is no scientific evidence that fermented juice is better. (You can google around for this, I don&#039;t want to link to commercial sites.)

I&#039;d be interested to hear why they chose the fermented version for this study...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a link to a U of Hawaii web site talking about noni, and how it goes through the fermentation process, which is why I&#039;m fairly sure that fermenting it is the standard preparation:

http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/noni/fruit_juices.asp

The first time I tried Noni was when I was on my honeymoon in Belize about six years ago. I had heard about Noni, but had never tried it. But I got our naturalist/guide to take me to a small village where there was an herbalist. He lived in this small ramshackle house on the edge of town, and there was a noni bush growing outside. In the house, there was a shelf with some recycled plastic bottles of brown liquid, which I was told was noni juice. I imagine it was fermented. I think all noni juice is basically fermented, but maybe I&#039;m wrong about that. This stuff was, though.

I bought a couple of bottles, and to my wife&#039;s dismay, started drinking the juice. She (and our guide) thought I was nuts to drink this unlabeled brown liquid out of these used plastic bottles (they were from an orange-juice bottling plant in the next town.)

Within a couple of weeks, a shoulder problem that had been stopping me from swimming for a number of years was basically gone, and I was up to a mile or so every other day within a couple of months. An enlarged prostate seemed to go away, too, and I didn&#039;t have to get up at night to go to the bathroom anymore. So along with any cancer protection, my experience was that it was a pretty potent anti-inflammatory, but that may have been because that was my body&#039;s particular reaction. I have heard that from others, though.]]></description>

i&#039;d be interested on your thoughts on this - quackery or a hypothesis worth testing?]]></description>
