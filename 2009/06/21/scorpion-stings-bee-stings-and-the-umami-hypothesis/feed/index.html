		<description><![CDATA[I live in Almeria, Spain and have suffered from arthritis in both my wrists for several years. In June 2010 I was stung by a scorpion on my right index finger. It was extremely painful for two days but lo and behold, a week later there was no arthritis in my right wrist. It is now October 2010 and still clear. 
Is there any homeopathic treatment using scorpion venom? It would be nice to treat the other hand but I am not keen for direct contact with a scorpion again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] This is also a reason that theory is important. John Tukey, the statistician, spoke of &#8220;gathering strength&#8221; when analyzing data. It is rare that a single body of data tells you how to analyze it, he said. (For example, what transformation to use.) You should use similar data sets to help decide. Scientific theory has the same effect. Before I started drinking kombucha, I didn&#8217;t have obvious digestive problems (unlike a friend) and my immune system seemed to work well. So it wasn&#8217;t easy to measure its effect. Yet I drink it and am untroubled by the evidence that worries RVM because I have a theory: the umami hypothesis (that we need a steady intake of bacteria to be healthy). This allows me to assess the effect of kombucha &#8212; whether it is likely to be good or bad &#8212; with the help of evidence from other bacteria-rich food (yogurt, natto, etc.) and much different data (the effect of bee stings on arthritis, hormesis, epidemiology, the effects of turmeric, etc.). Because the umami hypothesis appears to be true, apparently bacteria intake is beneficial &#8212; and kombucha has lots of bacteria. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow! That is a really interesting idea. If accupuncture is just a special case of hormesis, that implies accupuncturists who do an especially good job maintaining a sterile environment could easily have *worse* results than those who are less careful. It gives us a non-woo hypothesis to explain why one particular accupuncturist might have great results in his office which can&#039;t be reproduced by other accupuncturists or via the same interventions performed in a carefully controlled laboratory experiment somewhere else.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Technically that would be scorpion stings. As far as I know scorpions don&#039;t bite (with mouth parts) except when they are eating small insect (which of course they have to bite in order to eat). But the sting (at the end of their tail) can be nasty. During my teenage years, I was stung by a scorpion at a boy scout camping trip. It hurt but I had no other reactions. I&#039;ve been stung by bees innumerable times throughout my childhood and a wasp once or twice.]]></description>
