In more detail, when you bought far more of your share of crystalline fructose and when you were in China, you trained your spam filterers that those topics are more likely to be legitimate by marking legitimate email containing those topics as &quot;not spam.&quot; Thus when spammers sent you spam about every conceivable topic â€“ and they do â€“ the subsets of that spam mentioning crystalline fructose and China were less likely to meet your filter&#039;s it&#039;s-spam threshold, and some of those spams slipped into your inbox.

But they do send spam about everything, and your spam filter selects the subset of everything that is similar to your past legitimate email, thus creating the illusion that the spammers are targeting your interests.]]></description>
