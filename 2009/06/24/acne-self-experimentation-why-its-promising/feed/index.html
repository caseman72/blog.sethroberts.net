		<description><![CDATA[I have had acne all my life not bad but consistent and I am now 38. I have never used soap on my face. As a teenager I realized that this made things worse. I also don&#039;t use any creams at all (except for suncream lotion and that makes things much worse so I tend to stay in the shade instead.
I moved from a dry air environment (Christchurch New Zealand) to a very humid environment (Auckland New Zealand) 3 years ago and my acne has been much worse since.
I have not yet found a solution for this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aloha,
I had a huge acne problem in graduate school...I had volcanic pimples and those pimples had pimples too.  It was painful, it was embarrassing, I was miserable.  
I did so much research.  I tried all kinds of skin care products with no success at all.  I didn&#039;t want to do accutane because I am a beer drinker and I hear that accutane is hard on the liver.  I discovered spironolactone and persuaded my doctor to let me try it.  At 100 mg a day, my acne literally disappeared; one day I was generating new pimples and the next day, no new ones, and so on, until all that had been there was healed and no new pimples.  Hallelujah!  So I was on spironolactone for a couple of years and then moved to Hawaii, where it is difficult to persuade a doctor to prescribe medicine off-label (spironolactone is actually a weak diuretic that treats high blood pressure by helping flush out water, but has the extra benefit of binding extra androgens).  I started to panic, and then just sat down and thought about what that means, binding excess androgens.  I remembered reading that excess androgens are what cause pattern baldness and prostrate enlargement in men, so I looked for an herbal remedy for those symptoms and presto!  Saw palmetto is one, and spearmint is another.  A few days off spironolactone, and I was just beginning to get some pimples along my jaw line, and began taking 600 mg of Saw palmetto every day in the morning, and drinking spearmint tea sometime during the day.  No more pimples.  This went on for about a month and then I realized I had been forgetting to take the saw palmetto.  Okay, so just spearmint tea.  Still no pimples.  Then I realized I had forgotten to drink spearmint tea for a few days and decided, since I didn&#039;t have any pimples, to wait and see.  Well, something changed, and not sure if it was the saw palmetto, the spearmint tea, or the combination, but I still don&#039;t get pimples (except a couple of very tiny ones at PMS time) anymore and that was about six months ago.  My skin is clearer than it has ever been.  And I keep both saw palmetto and spearmint tea handy just in case!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Cure Together has acne treatment statistics: Comparisons of the effectiveness of about a dozen treatments. Only two treatments rate high for effectiveness and both have only a few raters. Neither of the high-rated treatments (Roaccutane andÂ Dr. Hauschka Skin Care) was part of Stone-Age life. Because of the absence of acne in at least a few groups of people living more Stone-Age-like (stoneagesque?) lives, it is likely that something about modern life causes acne.

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe one reason teens don&#039;t self-experiment with acne is because where the parents can afford it, they&#039;ll take their child to the doctor for Accutane or some other prescription in the hope of solving the problem quickly. If the mindset is that acne is genetic and/or inevitable, people aren&#039;t likely to look to self-experimentation. 

I never had bad teen acne, but now in my 40s I&#039;ve developed &quot;hormonal acne&quot; (apparently one indication of this is that it is isolated around my jawline).  I started taking zinc, which helped some but not completely.  One day we were out of milk (which I drink a couple of times a day in my cappuccino) so I skipped it. I skipped milk several days, in fact, and noticed that my skin was clearer. Then I drank milk and within two days the cyst-y, painful acne was back.  I&#039;m not completely dairy-free--I love cheese and yogurt too much--but I&#039;ve eliminated the milk and really scaled back on daily cheese consumption and my skin is clearing up, although not entirely. 

Maybe one of these days I&#039;ll go hog wild and try to eliminate caffeine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, Given the information about how bad rancid fats are, and how most industrial oils (high in omega 6 polyunsaturated lipids) used to make fried foods at restaurants are rancid, I&#039;d guess that it&#039;s the rancid fat and not the potato starch that caused your acne when you ate french fries. Try a self experiment at home: cut up some potatoes into fries and cook one batch in a pan containing coconut oil (or lard or beef tallow or ghee) and another batch in a different pan using cotton-seed oil or corn oil. Eat one one day and eat the other a week later. Use an ABBA design to really nail down the effect (if there is one). That is, eat the corn oil fries on week 1 and week 4 and the coconut oil fries on week 2 and 3. If you get acne for a few days in weeks 1 and 4 but not 2 and 3 you then have clear evidence for my hypothesis. If you get acne all four weeks or sporadically (e.g., weeks 1 and 2 only) then the evidence would fail to support the hypothesis. Or you may get outbreaks on weeks 2 and 3 only which would disconfirm my hypothesis and suggest that it&#039;s fries cooked in coconut oil (or ghee or whatever you use) that causes it--but would contradict the evidence collected from restaurant fries (which are NOT cooked in coconut oil).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found though some self experimentation that French Fries cause my acne.  Eat even a few fries and within 3 days I get pimples.  No fries, no pimples.  

It&#039;s something about the French Fries specifically.  I can eat baked potatoes without any problems.  I&#039;m guessing there is something in the fried potato that is particularly yummy to the acne bacteria.

I&#039;ve also seen a combination of lots of salt + caffeine sometimes cause me to break out, but its much less likely.  I&#039;m thinking this happens due to high blood pressure causing stress, but I&#039;m not sure.  Theoretically burgers have more salt than the fries, but I&#039;ve never gotten acne from eating just burgers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most illnesses including acne are probably always the result of some combination of genetics and environment. A succinct formulation of this is: our genes didn&#039;t evolve to kill us or to make us sick. In the case of acne, it seems unlikely that our genes would want us to have ugly blemishes on our faces, especially during the years of peak reproductive life. Wouldn&#039;t they be strongly selected against?]]></description>
