		<description><![CDATA[I love Ray Bradbury.  Every April he gives a speech at UCLA during the Festival of Books and I love to hear him speak.  He&#039;s so inspiring.

However, I think he&#039;s wrong about the Internet and he&#039;s certainly entitled to his own opinion.

I think the Internet is now for good or ill (and more often good than ill) the new library of the world.

It takes an entirely different set of skills to manage it though.  And the Internet, along with email, can certainly be a distraction.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t know you went to Caltech (new reader here).  Did you see this article in Engineering &amp; Science?  http://eands.caltech.edu/articles/LXXII1/mazmanian.pdf.  It&#039;s all about beneficial bacteria, mostly with respect to irritable bowl syndrome (where they&#039;ve been doing the science with mice), but making suggestive connections to asthma, eczema, and even diabetes.

I&#039;m making my second batch of yogurt today.  :)  It&#039;s fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, college is not a one-size-fits-all. There is too much reliance on college these days. There are a lot of students going to college who have no business doing so, probably in part because college is a business. But, in defense of colleges/universities--I&#039;ve thrived in and on them. They fit me like a glove and allowed me to flourish and be creative. And they continue to do so now that I&#039;m a professor.]]></description>
