		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
Perhaps you should heed your own advice. I&#039;m referring to the title of your subsequent post - &quot;A Little Knowledge...&quot;.
Aging meat is controlled breakdown of the proteins by lactic acid which tenderizes it. It&#039;s usually carried out at a few degrees above freezing and has very little to do with fermentation.
Umami has something to do with access by the taste buds to glutamine in food (an amino acid and a neuro transmitter).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is known in hanging meat. Hanging meat is a big issue amongst foodies in the UK. When my family has game or turkey at Christmas it&#039;s typically hung outside in a shed for a few days prior to cooking. Perhaps it most vocal proponent of hanging meat in the UK is Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, there&#039;s a review of his &quot;Meat&quot; book, in which he discusses hanging at length, here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2004/jun/19/highereducation.houseandgarden

We even have a company called the Well Hung Meat Co.: http://www.wellhungmeat.com/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think in certain contexts people talk about aged meat. I worked at a steakhouse once and the managers would tell the customers the meat is aged. Before you started blogging about this though I&#039;d never heard (or paused to reflect on the fact) that the purpose of aging meat is to cultivate beneficial bacteria. But there are lots of things regarding meat that people willfully forget...like the fact that it&#039;s full of dead parasites. I also worked at a Long John Silver&#039;s as a teen and learned to cut the fish. We were taught to remove the small pink parasites when we found them. They weren&#039;t a health issue, just aesthetic (they plump when you cook em, so people would notice them in the white fish meat). I was told other meats have parasites too but you can&#039;t see them because they&#039;re the same color as the meat.]]></description>
