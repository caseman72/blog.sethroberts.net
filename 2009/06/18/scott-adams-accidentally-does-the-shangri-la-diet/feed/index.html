		<description><![CDATA[Sinus Buster is a nasal spray containing capsaicin pepper.  A while back there was an article in Woman&#039;s World magazine about a side effect of using Sinus Buster: appetite suppression.  Now there is a weight loss version on the market, probably a diluted version.  (Aside: Woman&#039;s World has also featured an article on SLD).  I bought the regular SB and have used it on occasion when I have sinus troubles but usually at that point I don&#039;t have much of an appetite anyway so I can&#039;t verify the appetite suppression effect.]]></description>
