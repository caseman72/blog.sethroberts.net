		<description><![CDATA[I think if you look closely into the history you find that American auto makers found Deming, and embraced his methods, and subsequently quality of US cars went up.

However, Deming&#039;s book Out of the Crisis is riddled with frustration that US management is missing the point of his methods. They&#039;re seeing innovations like just-in-time and kanban and consistently seeing only short term improvements.

Deming reiterates that the real innovation is in management.

That&#039;s where he found things falling short the most.]]></description>
