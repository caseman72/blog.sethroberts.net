		<description><![CDATA[David, that&#039;s an interesting point. Whereas drug companies lose money if the experiment has a certain outcome (the drug doesn&#039;t work), someone who self-experiments benefits with either outcome (the treatment works or it doesn&#039;t work). Because either way the self-experimenter is closer to improving his or her life. You could say the payoff matrix is more balanced.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems that the expense of the study is an indication of how much the person funding the study stands to make due to the desired outcome of the study. With self-experimentation, you are &quot;funding&quot; the study with your time (which you could use for other activities) and typically don&#039;t stand to make any money or realize any benefit other than making your own life a little better.]]></description>
