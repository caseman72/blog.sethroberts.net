		<description><![CDATA[Yes, by &quot;reliably different&quot; I meant &quot;statistically significantly different.&quot;

The authors started with a directional prediction they wished to test. When you have a directional prediction convention is to use a one-tailed test because one direction of change is the focus of interest and is much more plausible than the other direction of change. In spite of this they used two-tailed tests.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two comments: first, you state that the overall outcome was not &quot;reliably different&quot;.  I assume what you mean is &quot;not statistically significantly different&quot;.  Statistical significance shouldn&#039;t be conflated with reliability of a finding (Nickerson R.S. (2000) Null hypothesis significance testing: A review of an old and continuing controversy. Psychological Methods, 5(2), 241-301, see specifically p. 256-257.).  
Second, I don&#039;t quite understand what you mean by the authors misleading by using 2 tailed p-values.  Do you mean they used one tailed p values to make decisions but report 2 tailed p-values (i.e., they were confused) or that the tests should have been done with 1 tailed p-values only.  If the former, I get it. If the latter, why would it be necessary to only use 1 tailed p-values in this setting...aren&#039;t differences in either direction of interest?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, I don&#039;t think this study was biassed at all. The areas of possible improvement I point out are found in most epidemiological papers. The data analysis was done as it was because that&#039;s the way epidemiologists are taught to do that sort of thing. Not &quot;to produce a negative result.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s always been easy to construct a study to produce a negative result, if you can be confident the method won&#039;t be criticized.  Because of its construction, this one doesn&#039;t, and can&#039;t, tell us much of anything about autism and g-i problems. Instead, we need to ask, here, what it demonstrates that they have constructed this particular study this way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of autism and methodology, I was scanning a book on the epidemiology of schizophrenia for a story I&#039;m working on, and in the very first chapter, right after explaining the difficulty in quantifying some general &quot;heritability&quot; from a particular sample, the author points out that studies of vaccine side effects can&#039;t separate cases from controls, so there&#039;s a methodological snag there. I have no reason to think autism is related to vaccines -- I need to look at the studies -- but if experts gloss over those sorts of technicalities in framing e.g. vaccine policy to the public, is it any wonder a savvy parent could become suspicious?]]></description>
