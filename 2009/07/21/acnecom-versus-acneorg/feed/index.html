		<description><![CDATA[In a lot of cases it can be very difficult to heal acne and comparable skin diseases. I am a long time sufferer myself and I am still hoping to find a treatment that works for me. I will try out what is mentioned here, maybe it brings relief. Stupid companies and their &#039;neutral&#039; websites probably partly ruined my skin, screw them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Out of all food, caffeine has the greatest impact on my acne. Abstaining from anything with caffeine in it (including chocolate), took care of ~25% of my acne problem. 

Benzaclin, a prescription topical agent, took care of another 4th of the problem. No other medications worked.

Actually, the most striking difference I&#039;ve seen from any therapy has been simple supplementation with Pantothenic acid, a b vitamin that is cheap and OTC. Nothing cleared my &quot;backne&quot; until I started using that. I don&#039;t hear a lot on this blog about supplementation, but that one worked for me. Oddly, from my self-experimentation, fish oil/flax seems to have a mild aggravating effect on my acne.

I&#039;ve had to do extensive experimentation to find the right soap product. I disagree that washing with soap is a problem - its simply a matter of finding the right soap. I recommend the facial cleanser from Neutrogena. Find it at target, in a blue squeeze bottle. Cleans but doesn&#039;t dry the face out (contrary to what would seem logical, skin that is too dry can also lead to breakouts, in my experience).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When it comes to dissing dermatologists and medical journals, Michael Holick deserves some sort of prize. I saw this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uctv.tv/search-details.aspx?showID=15773&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;highly entertaining lecture&lt;/a&gt; on UCTV. Among other things, good examples of: 1) telling stories; 2) use of clinical, &quot;rogue&quot; and self-experimentation (small and large samples).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Based on your experience with dermatologists, could you compare the regimen recommended on acne.org with what a &quot;typical&quot; dermatologist would prescribe?

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The acne.org paragraph is one of the most epistemologically sound I&#039;ve ever read about a practical health problem like acne.  Not only does he have better information than the paid experts, but his underlying view of human knowledge, its limits, and how to improve it stands out as well.]]></description>
