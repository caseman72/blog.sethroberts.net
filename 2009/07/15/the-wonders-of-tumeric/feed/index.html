		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
I don&#039;t follow your logic completely.  Becuase the placebo effect is motivated by the patient&#039;s beliefs, it matters what the patient thinks.

If the man did not expect anti-inflammatory drugs to work, he would probably not have a placebo effect from them.  If he did expect turmeric to cure his pain, it would be more likely to have a placebo effect.  Yes?

I&#039;m not disagreeing with possible benefit from turmeric, but your dismissal that it could not be a placebo effect, in this case.

Thanks,
Jeff]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From Wikipedia on curcumin [turmeric&#039;s active ingredient]:

&quot;Numerous studies have demonstrated that curcumin, amongst only a few other things such as high impact exercise, learning, bright light, and antidepressant usage, has a positive effect on neurogenesis in the hippocampus and concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), reductions in both of which are associated with stress, depression, and anxiety.&quot;

See also: &quot;Role of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in the Circadian Regulation of the Suprachiasmatic Pacemaker by Light&quot;, The Journal of Neuroscience, April 15, 2000, 20(8):2978-2987.

		<description><![CDATA[The current issue of Wired arrived today.  It contains a story about cartoonist Scott Adams dealing with a neurological problem that prevented him from speaking.

The article describes his quest to regain his speech, which involved quite a bit of self-experimentation although ultimately an experiment with surgery was required.

I wonder if he ever tried giving up the Diet Coke habit he mentions on his blog.  I would have tried that experiment first, given how many people self-report neurological problems linked to diet drinks.

I realize this isn&#039;t turmeric related but I thought it was interesting.]]></description>
