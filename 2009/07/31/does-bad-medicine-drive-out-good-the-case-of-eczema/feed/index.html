		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for responding.  Yes, people truly want to lose weight.  It seems like Mcardle/Campos argue that this desire to lose weight stems from a major, erroneous misconception that fat equals unhealthy.

But I don&#039;t think that&#039;s right.  In college, being overweight, I struggled to get to classes around campus.  I was starting to feel pain in my hips and knees.  I had terrible acne from the types of food I was eating.  I was often directly miserable from being overweight.

Of course, strict calorie reduction, which health care experts seem to often advocate, often makes people more miserable. 

That&#039;s what&#039;s great about the SLD.  You lose weight in a smart way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bad money drives out good because money has two (among others) functions: store of value and means of exchange.  The bad money is good enough for the exchange, while the good money is retained for it&#039;s storage value.

Presumably in this context we have rituals/knowledge that get used for treatments.  But they have value in differing ways: short-term v.s. long-term efficacy.

There are some narratives of the founding of professional medicine that argue that for centuries their was an unlimited demand for medical knowledge so lots of folks would volunteer to provide treatments.  Such practitioners have a preference for treatments that have high short term efficacy - blood letting, caffeine, purgatives, etc. etc.  Only once a monopoly was granted longer term efficacy could get a bit of seat at the table.

No doubt all knowledge economies have analogous problems.  How the split between short-term and long-term efficacy is balanced ain&#039;t amenable to naive rule making.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thehova, thanks for letting me know about the McArdle posts. Besides being pleased she mentioned me, I thought the interview with Campos was very good. He makes several good points that aren&#039;t usually made. I disagree with him, however, that being thin isn&#039;t important. I wished McArdle had asked him: What about people who want to be thin to look more attractive? When Campos goes on about how it doesn&#039;t really help your  health to be thinner, he&#039;s ignoring what I thought was pretty obvious: that it does help your attractiveness.

Perhaps any reader of this blog doesn&#039;t need to be told that she appears to misunderstand my theory. I say that the obesity epidemic has arisen because we are eating foods that taste exactly the same each time (and have lots of quickly digested calories). Lots of factory-made food. Factories make food that&#039;s less variable than homemade food. Such food produces stronger flavor-calorie associations, which raise our set points more. This isn&#039;t the same as saying our food has lots of fat, sugar, and salt.

Dennis, yes, that&#039;s a good example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In his book, Taubes shows that carbohydrate restriction for weight loss was the conventional wisdom for around 100 years, but with the advent of the lipid hypothesis of heart disease, the knowledge was shoved down the memory hole. When low carb diets were revived, it was almost as if no one had ever heard of such a thing. But if you had gone to a major medical center or clinic for weight loss up until the early 70s, you would have gotten a low carb diet.]]></description>
