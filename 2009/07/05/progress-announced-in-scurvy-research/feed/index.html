		<description><![CDATA[Astonishingly enough, the means to prevent scurvy was actually forgotten only decades later.  Robert Scott, the south polar explorer, and most of his crew died of scurvy in 1912.  They brought along no food containing vitamin C, or indeed anything fresh.  The Royal Navy had lately standardized on rations including canned lime juice that had all the vitamin C cooked out.  Scott&#039;s rival, Roald Amundsen, fed his crew fresh seal meat, and lost none of them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Depressing, and yet optimistic.  Scurvy was once considered as big a problem as cancer for those who got it or had to pay for it, yet its solution proved pathetically simple, even before the precise mechanism of how it was caused was understood.

But also depressing: It took decades for this solution, easy as it was, to be widely adopted.  Per Wikipedia, John Woodall first identified a a dietary deficiency as the cause of scurvy, and prescribed fresh food or citrus fruit as a cure for it, in 1614.  It wasn&#039;t until 1747 that James Lind &quot;formally&quot; proved scurvy could be both treated and prevented with citrus fruit (I don&#039;t know what what &quot;formally&quot; means here).  But it wasn&#039;t until the Napoleonic Wars, which began in 1803, that scurvy was finally eradicated from the Royal Navy.
