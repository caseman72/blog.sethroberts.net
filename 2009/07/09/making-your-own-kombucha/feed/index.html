		<description><![CDATA[Ah, so I&#039;ve just been a little impatient sounds like. I&#039;ll let this batch go longer this time.  How much sugar do you use for two quarts?  And do you use vinegar or some tea from a finished batch or none of these?

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dan, I&#039;ve varied the number of tea bags (per two quarts water). 3 is too weak, 5 is too strong. So I use 4. The flavor I get is just as good as GT&#039;s, if I wait a few weeks or more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just noticed on the side of the GT&#039;s bottle it says &quot;cultured for 30 days&quot;. Now this is interesting because everything I&#039;ve read online and the instructions from Kombucha America all say the same thing, from 7 to 10 days to culture. If 30 days is what it takes to get something like GT&#039;s, I&#039;m wondering how much of each ingredient they use at the start. Could they be using quite a bit more sugar, so when it gets to 30 days, although the sugar is gone you have a much tastier beverage?

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve done two batches now and starting on my third. The first I took down too soon and it was too sweet because of it. I simply judged it wrong during testing. I should have let it ferment longer. It took 9 days. It had 1 1/4 cup sugar and 10 green tea bags and 1/4 cup white vinegar. The second batch I used 1 cup sugar and 8 tea bags (lipton) and 1/4 cup white vinegar. This one took 9 days too but this time I was better at judging the sweetness when I finished it.  Interestingly this second batch had a fizz to it, even in the big gallon jug as I was pouring it into 16 oz ball jars for the fridge.  But after it&#039;s been in the fridge even with lids, the fizz went away. 

This next batch I&#039;m starting today I&#039;ll use 1 cup sugar and 10 lipton tea bags. At the end I plan on leaving a few of the 16 oz ball jars of finished tea at room temp for a few days before refrigerating. I&#039;ve read this will give it fizz. 

All batches I use a gallon wide mouth jar, put in a Coleman ice chest with part of a heating pad inside. I have a digital thermometer inside and I keep it around 80 degrees, plus or minus a few degrees. My first batch I used a starter culture from Kombucha America. The second and now my third batch I use the mushroom from the old batch. I rinse it off using spring water first.

My goal is to get it to taste like GT&#039;s original version. So far mine have not had as much flavor or tasted as strong as I&#039;d like. 

Too much info?

		<description><![CDATA[This is basically the method I used to get started.  I just went the &quot;speedy&quot; route and brewed some fresh sweet tea, let it cool to room temp, put it in a widemouth gallon sized jar (same size I&#039;d ultimately use for a full batch), cover, and wait.  I&#039;ve now on batches two and three of kombucha -- this is probably five weeks later?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, thanks for providing me with a piece of your Kombucha starter. I placed it in a wide-mouth glass jar with some black tea and sugar about a week ago and a nice mother has formed on top. I tasted it last night and it is still too sweet so I&#039;ll let it sit some more and keep tasting it every few days until it&#039;s sour enough for my liking. It already smells great!]]></description>
