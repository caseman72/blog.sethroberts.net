		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,
I don&#039;t know if you&#039;re talking about taking flax oil for the SLD or in general. If in general, you can combine it with other foods, such as yogurt or juice - I hardly taste it when I do this.]]></description>

I know Seth recommends flax oil, but some of us find the strong flavor and aftertaste hard to take, even with nose-clipping. My understanding from the SLD book was that canola oil was also a good source of omega-3.]]></description>
