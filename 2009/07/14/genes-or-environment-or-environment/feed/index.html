		<description><![CDATA[&quot;No one had ever told Aaron or his mother or her father that their condition suggested that environmental changes would help them.&quot;
I&#039;m quite certain that this is wrong. Surely many people offered suggestions to them. &quot;Wear sunscreen. Put on a hat.  Do sunglasses help?&quot; Etc. That they didn&#039;t phrase it the way you might have is irrelevant, as is that all of the proposed solutions either failed or were only marginally useful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;In other words, the newly-visible genetic difference implied there was something lacking in the artificial conditions. The genetic difference implied the environment mattered. The opposite of the usual interpretation.&quot;

I have argued this exact thing many times, as have two medical doctors who are friends of mine, to explain attention deficit disorder. Even fifty years ago, ADD would not have been a problem for most folks as our lives were more mobile. We did a lot more with our bodies back then. Unfortunately, as we became less active, certain individuals became unable to cope. It&#039;s not that the round peg (ourselves) became square all of a sudden, but that the square hole (the environment) became round, creating a problem.

One of the most popular methods of coping with ADD, as you might expect, is to change your immediate environment to become more ADD-friendly. Indeed, those who are diagnosed later in life (such as myself)  probably already did so subconsciously, but were unable to adapt for some reason later on, causing it to become an issue. Myself, I played seven musical instruments by the time I graduated college, because it was the only thing I found I was good at and enjoyed. This doesn&#039;t translate well to real-life scenarios, however, where we are expected to have 40 hour a week desk jobs, pay bills, etc.

To anyone with ADD such as myself, this environment relationship is obvious, as it is something we have lived with our entire lives. Clearly we are not stupid, yet for some reason we are still at a disadvantage in modern society. In primitive society, something like ADD may have even been a biological advantage. 

&quot;The genetic effect showed there was something wrong with the environment, just as it did in DeCourseyâ€™s experiment.&quot;

Exactly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, that&#039;s a nice tie-in with the squirrel study. I think the same theme is discussed in the 10,000 year explosion. The authors suggest that different modern peoples around the world have different mixtures of genes, with some people lacking alleles adapted toward a particular aspect of the environment, such as the Native Americans lacking alleles for small-pox immunity, or Europeans lacking alleles protecting against malaria. The genetic differences are meaningless in the environment to which the people are adapted, but show up when they are placed in the wrong environment (in the NA case the wrong environment was having small pox and other diseases introduced to their location). I think much of the data from Weston Price&#039;s book shows the same thing by showing how poorly many people around the world did on a Western diet of sugar and refined flour. The sugar and flour was the wrong nutritional environment. I really have thrived after moving toward a WAPF / Paleo / Primal type diet. And many people on the paleo and primal forums (e.g., Stephan&#039;s Whole Health Source blog and Mark&#039;s Daily Apple) have reported much lowered sensitivity to the sun after going primal or WAPF. There was discussion on Stephan&#039;s blog of the importance of the correct ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids on inflammation which can directly affect sun sensitivity. Getting off of industrial vegetable oils and replacing them with natural fats (e.g., saturated and omega 3 PUFAs and MUFAs) leads to improved gum health, healthier arteries, improved quality of sleep, and lowered sensitivity to sunlight among other things. It all revolves around systemic inflammation.]]></description>
