		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I started using Kombucha 2 days ago after trying a lot of different techniques to relief my stomach problems. I can eat only certain foods, and have problme when eating yogurt, kefir or cheese, even bread. I have noticed that after drinking Kombucha I have some sour feeling in my stomach, like something is fermenting. Is it normal? It feels like I am full of acid .. Please tell me about first reactions that Kombucha does.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My heartburn occurs daily unless a) I stick to a strict diet with no carbs, dairy, or greasy/fatty food, like the Paleo Diet or b) I drink Kombucha daily.  It&#039;s not always possible to do a), so Kombucha has literally been a life saver for me.  The medical knowledge that is being sold by doctors regarding heartburn is basically false.   I have seen 3 about my heartburn, researched heartburn, GERD, and acid reflux literature throughout the medical literature and on the internet, taken Prilosec, Reglan, and got an endoscopy performed as well.  The search for an answer did not stop there.  5 years later, after long periods of experimentation, I have come to realize you have to listen to your own body when it comes to these kinds of health issues.  Listen to its reactions to every kind of food.  The FDA and the medical industry in the U.S. are completely distorted in a way that is too complicated to explain, most likely due to government noses where they shouldn&#039;t be.  I&#039;m sure they can help your broken leg, but not your heartburn.  Now that the FDA has banned Kombucha until further notice, I am starting to brew my own.  Good luck to the rest of the misguided herd out there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[RE: Peter

Kombucha is similar to vinegar, in that it is a base, not an acid.  Kombucha also contains proteins and bacterias naturally found in the stomach and digestive track, so it can rebalance an otherwise off-kilter stomach.  In other words, it can off-set the increased amounts of stomach acid that play a large role in Acid-Reflux.  

Also, Kombucha isn&#039;t a placebo, and there&#039;s no myth around it.  It eases digestion and helps the body purge more fat, while getting more nutrients out of the food that&#039;s being digested.  That&#039;s why the &#039;wonder tonic&#039; claims are so far reaching--Kombucha&#039;s work in the digestive track goes a long way towards buttressing the immune system and upping energy levels, primarily because the drinker is getting more bang out of every calorie digested.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had fantastic luck &quot;curing&quot; my GERD [Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, also called acid reflux] with kombucha.  I developed very serious acid reflux very quickly and was prescribed a very high dose of omeprazole to suppress my symptoms.  I saw a lot on the internet suggesting that highly acidic foods can actually help control GERD.  Apple cider vinegar was too harsh for me, but I love kombucha and by drinking at least 1/2 bottle at least every other day, I have decreased my omeprazole dose from 80 mg/day to 40 mg/day or less.  I&#039;m confident that I will be able to eventually wean myself off of the omeprazole completely, but probably won&#039;t be giving up the kombucha anytime soon.  Try the Gingerade flavor by GT&#039;s - it&#039;s excellent!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] My friend with acid reflux &#8212; who used to have acid reflux &#8212; contacted me today: My stomach is so much better [since I started drinking kombucha]. I rarely have problems. Every once in a while I might be a little uncomfortable. Then I drink a little kombucha, it gets better within an hour. I got up in the middle of the night the other night and I felt the usual kind of pain, took some sips of the kombucha, felt better, and fell back asleep. Hardly ever have pain now. The kombucha is much more effective than the Asiphax medicine I took. That was $60 for a 10-day course. It might even be more effective than Prilosec. (Which cleared up the problem but then it came back.)Â  I&#8217;ve been drinking kombucha for about three weeks. I really like the grape, guava, and strawberry flavors of the Synergy brand. The grape flavor is like sangria that&#8217;s just started to go bad. A couple of people I&#8217;ve tried to turn on to it but they just can&#8217;t stand the taste. My levels of stress haven&#8217;t decreased. I&#8217;m drinking less than half a bottle a day. Now the problem is that I forget I&#8217;m supposed to have stomach trouble so I forget to drink it.

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting post on acid reflux by Michael Eades:

http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/uncategorized/heartburn-cured/

After a couple of weeks off carbs, acid reflux resolves.  What seems to be happening is that a high-carb intake stokes an immense population of intestinal flora which generates enough back pressure to drive acid all the way up to the throat.  Take a respite from the carbs, the flora dies down and the throat gets a break.

I think there is also something in the kombucha which is correcting our internal flora -- either suppressing some of the stuff that shouldn&#039;t be there, or supporting stuff that should be there (but isn&#039;t, with a typical diet.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the causes of acid reflux are probably varied.  One cause is the the sphincter between the esophagus and the stomach becomes defective and the stomach acid (which is otherwise kept in the stomach by a well functioning sphincter) splashes up into the esophagus, thereby causing the sensation that is commonly referred to as acid reflux.  the various drugs, i.e., prolosec, pepcid etc.. eliminate the acid thereby eliminating the sensation and discomfort.  The problem is that this is a physical condition that requires constant treatment.  long term use of prolosec (or other PPI therapies) is associated with both increased hip fractures (as i recall 400% increase) and a 40%? increase in pneumonia (as i recall for hospitalized patients).
   since i have this condition, i&#039;ll try kombucha, but the only way it can work for me is if it somehow eliminates/reduces stomach acid.  hard to believe that something acidic will eliminate/reduce stomach acid, but i&#039;m open minded.  
  Up to now i&#039;ve found that eating arugula helps to reduce stomach acid (i read about an extract of arugula being used as an alternative to drugs such as prolosec; but to my knowledge, an arugula extract is unavailable at this time).  and i also take pepcid before i sleep and use a special sleeping wedge to keep my up body at a 20 degree?  angle to lessen the acid reflux.  
  BTW, the condition is not simply a benign discomfort.  It can lead to esophageal cancer, which is the fastest growing cancer in the western world,]]></description>
