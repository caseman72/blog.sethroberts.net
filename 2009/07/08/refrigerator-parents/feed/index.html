		<description><![CDATA[I agree, Nathan, the idea that &#039;bacteria don&#039;t survive a trip through the stomach&quot; makes no sense except as a vague approximation. (Like caloric values of foods.) And if 99.99% of a certain bacteria are killed in the stomach, so what if we eat a billion of them? However, the notion that we should be constantly eating bacteria-laden food (I believe daily) implies a great daily die-off. And therefore a need for replenishment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everybody insists bacteria don&#039;t survive a trip through the stomach, yet our colon is full of them.  How did they get there, and how did they survive the trip through the stomach?  Is it only bacterial spores that get through?  Should we be eating slow-dried fermented food, because those bacteria have had a chance to put themselves in spore capsules while it dried?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if the connection here to Crohn&#039;s is related to bacteria reducing the impact of anti-nutrients (phytic acid) -- such as those found in grains/legumes.

Or maybe it&#039;s just that so much of our ability to digest stuff is dependent on bacteria, so abundance (and perhaps diversity?) of bacteria make the gut much more efficient.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My daughter has Asperger&#039;s, but no discernible digestive problems.  I wonder if the connection is only that the apparent severity of autism symptoms is exacerbated by gut pain.  Fix the gut pain and the symptoms largely subside, just because autism sufferers are (as for other distractions) not good at ignoring pain.

The number of people reporting successful treatment of autism with chelation despite the difficult theoretical problems with the idea (chelation mostly removes metals from the liver) leads me to suspect that it&#039;s the big mineral supplements chelation patients get, after a session, that actually help.  It seems easy to test.]]></description>
