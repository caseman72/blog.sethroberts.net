		<description><![CDATA[Interesting how this &quot;snake oil&quot; comment that one of the tweets made seems to crop up repeatedly regarding the SLD. Funny thing is, the SLD is virtually free (i.e., the price of a bottle of ELOO or a bag of table sugar and tap water) and you don&#039;t stand to make any money on it (except from your book, of course). So it completely does not fit the pattern of a snake-oil salesman. The point of a snake-oil salesman is to make money by selling a placebo as if it were medicinal. But you aren&#039;t selling anything--so even if taking oil (or sugar water) by your method turns out not to work (and the evidence is against this) you&#039;re not getting rich off of it.]]></description>
