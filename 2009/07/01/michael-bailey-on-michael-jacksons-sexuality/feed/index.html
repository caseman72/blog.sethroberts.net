		<description><![CDATA[This completely ignores the fact that Michael Jackson factually suffered from two very disfiguring skin diseases, vitiligo and lupus. This is what his doctors have said about the reason behind his nasal surgeries:

Dr Richard Strick, who was appointed and paid for by the DA (Tom Sneddon) performed the court ordered examination of him in December 1993 and had viewed his medical records and therefore had no bias towards Jackson:
&lt;i&gt;
    â€œMichael had a disease vitiligo in which the pigment is lost and attempts had been made to bring that pigment back which had been unsuccessful so he tried to bleach it out so it would be one colour.

    Lupus is also an autoimmune disease and he also had skin involvement, which had destroyed part of the skin of his nose and his nasal surgeries and all were really reconstructive, to try and look normal. â€œ

    So all these nose reconstructions youâ€™re saying was as a result of him treating his lupus?

    â€œThe first one was to try and reconstruct from some scar tissue and obstruction that had happened with the skin there. It didnâ€™t work out very well and all subsequent attempts were to make it right.

    I think he was trying to look like a normal guy as best as that he could.â€&lt;/i&gt;

As for his sexuality, the court uncovered most of his desires:

http://lacienegasmiled.wordpress.com/category/2005-court-case/porn/

And many of his friends, girlfriends and employees have also spoken up about it:

http://lacienegasmiled.wordpress.com/category/love-sex-and-playboy/

And finally, his voice was not naturally that high. He only spoke that way publically back in the Thriller era, after that his voice was the same pitch as any of his brothers and could get very low:

Audio of his real voice in 2006

He kept it soft to conserve his voice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everyone else who agrees with me that any of that high-minded BS is actual BS, then I salute you. Good God!  Debbie said that? I have not seen that statement anywhere but here. And, yes, she tends to change her tales as much as LaToya Jackson.  LMP has said time and time again that her marriage to him was consummated.  Why in the world would she lie?  I think they had sex before they got married. Why wouldn&#039;t they have, anyway? They were married afterall.  I can&#039;t say that I know positively whether or not he was not bi-sexual or asexual to some degree, but I don&#039;t believe he was gay.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Saida is completely right. Michael Jackson wasn&#039;t an idiot. In fact, he was extremely intelligent and a good business man. The high pitched voice made him seem soft and gentle. Because of this soft voice, people thought of him as &#039;a nice guy&#039;. If any of you are planning on watching &#039;This Is It&#039;, listen out for his voice. It&#039;s deep and manly. As for thinking of himself as a puberescent, that&#039;s a load of bs. He danced in a very suggestive manner (if you don&#039;t think so, go watch his &#039;In The Closet&#039; video) and had sex with Lisa Marie Presley while they were married (she confirmed that). These are not things that young boys do. Regarding his face, I think that Michael is handsome. As for Debbie Rowe and the Peter pan thing, where is this interview? I won&#039;t believe it until I see it for myself. Even if she did say it, Debbie keeps changing her story. The last that I heard, her and Michael never even slept in the same room let alone with each other...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Except that his high pitched voice was a masquerade he put on for the media. Check out Michael Jackson&#039;s Private Home Movies on Youtube, Michael Jackson speaks out against racism, and the live concerts where he talks to his fans. It&#039;ll give you an idea what his normal talking voice sounded like. It&#039;ll likely also change your perception of the man in general.

He likes to think of himself as a puberescent? This part had me laugh out loud. So this is the reason for his sensual/sexual and very adult mannerism on stage?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Risa, to say Michael Jackson&#039;s plastic surgeries were due to Body Dysmorphic Disorder doesn&#039;t explain the high-pitched voice nor the interest in children that Bailey considers. More generally, attaching a name to a phenomenon (= diagnosis) isn&#039;t much of an explanation. For example, if I told a teenager, &quot;the explanation for the spots on your face is that you have acne,&quot; I think you&#039;d see what I mean about the difference between diagnosis and explanation.

I have no idea why you say Michael Jackson wasn&#039;t interested in young boys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael Jackson was not interested in young boys, nor was he interested in sex. His plastic surgeries were due to Body Dysmorphic Disorder. He identified himself with pubescent boys, as he was arresed at that stage emotionally. If he was interested in pubescent boys, he would have had sexual relations with many children. There was no way to get away with it, if he indeed molest children. Our society places too much emphasis on sexuality. Sexual deviation is considered to be more normal than asexuality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wilbur, Bailey&#039;s analysis makes 2 types of predictions: 1. Symptom cluster. Bailey is saying these four traits have a single cause. Those four traits should appear together in other cases. 2. Other traits. This analysis predicts that Jackson is sexually aroused by thinking of himself as a pubescent boy. In addition, identification of another erotic identity disorder similar to autogynephilia makes it clearer what the general concept is (just as the concept of autoimmune disease is clarified by having more examples).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree with your glowing appraisal. While well-written, the piece reminds me of the official sounding mumbo-jumbo produced by FBI profilers and the like: ad hoc, &quot;just-so stories&quot; that may convince juries, but are unfalsifiable and have no predictive power (which could serve as a good working definition of the entire &quot;science&quot; of psychology).]]></description>
