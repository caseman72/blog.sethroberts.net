		<description><![CDATA[[...] Seth Roberts says the experts get it wrong on nutrition. My rule of thumb for nutrition is that whatever the conventional New York Times-reading chatterbox/busybody wisdom thinks is good for you, eat the opposite. If you hear chiding and tsk-tsking from others about how many &#8220;grams of fat&#8221; or &#8220;bad cholesterol&#8221; or (this, that and the other bogeyman of the Oprah-watching crowd) that the food you&#8217;re eating has, you know you&#8217;re on the right track and indeed whatever you&#8217;re eating will probably be discovered to be good for you sometime in the next ten years. So just eat, and smile, and laugh and laugh at their ignorance and envy &#8211; that&#8217;s what I do. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bennetta, that&#039;s fascinating. Certainly lack of fermented food can cause digestive problems, that&#039;s very clear. I will add bad breath and body odor to the list of things possibly caused by not enough fermented food. It makes a lot of sense that eating fermented fish would improve digestion of fish thus reducing body odor caused by incomplete digestion. (I believe that Asians often think that Americans, who never eat rotten meat, smell of meat.) In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/01/26/the-inuit-paradox/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an earlier post&lt;/a&gt; I drew attention to the rotten fish that Eskimos eat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

	I find it interesting that you mention the Eskimo diet. My roommate, who is an Alaskan native (and spends 3-6 months of the year there) often brings it up when discussing food we eat. She has noted that the Alaskan Eskimo diet is similar to what we consider to be the classic â€œlow carb/Atkinsâ€ diet, with one exception: fermented food, which American low carb diets lack. Atkins/low carb diets are infamous for causing digestive problems, foul breath, and equally bad body odor. Eskimos do not have digestive problems or foul breath. Why? We think itâ€™s because Eskimos eat rotten fish.

I was curious about what you might have to say about this.]]></description>
