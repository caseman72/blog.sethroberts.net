		<description><![CDATA[My son has asthma and for many years now, we have been going along to see various doctors to help him, especially in autmn (fall). A friend of mine recently suggested that we try using a dehumidifier in his room. Now e didn&#039;t think his room was at all damp, but we thought &quot;hell, what have we got to lose&quot;. So we used it in his room for three hours a day (while he was out at school). His asthma has improved by about 75%.
Now I know that this may not work for everyone, because everyone&#039;s triggers are different, but in our son&#039;s case, he seems to be sensitive to the level of dampness in the air, and while we, his parents, think his room is perfectly ok, the damp air which we don&#039;t even notice, is setting him off.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Karky,

That&#039;s my take on this anecdote as well. I had just about the same experience, moving from south Florida where I had strong allergies every year to Stony Brook, Long Island for college. Stony Brook is way out on LI, not near NYC so it has very clean air coming off the ocean and lots of vegetation--but not the same vegetation as south Florida obviously. My allergies were just about completely gone after that move.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been thinking about this article all day yesterday, and I wonder if the child&#039;s symptoms disappeared when they moved to New York City because the trigger doesn&#039;t grow too much in the city.
Like hay.  Or ragweed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got asthma when I was 15, we moved to Corpus Christi, TX.  There is a Dow Chemical Plant near there.  I have had it ever since.  My worst symptoms until last spring were in Ft. Smith, AR.  They were almost non-exisistant in the Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX area,Jacksonville, FL, and Atlanta, GA;  and my symptoms were pretty mild here in MI.  However, when I started SLD 2 years ago, and started taking digestive enzymes to combat eloo nausea, my asthma symptoms almost completely disappeared.  I was estatic.  But then I had the worst asthma of my life last spring.  I was still taking the digestive enzymes.  This spring, my symptoms are very mild, but I have added a daily kefir drink to the mix.]]></description>
