		<description><![CDATA[Since this post is loosely related to self-experimentation I&#039;ll post this. I thought of you today watching the Discovery Science channel show on jellyfish. I looked up the incident on Wiki for you:

In 1964, Dr. Jack Barnes confirmed the cause of the syndrome to be due to a small box jelly, the Irukandji jellyfish (Carukia barnesi). In order to prove that the jellyfish was the cause of the syndrome, he captured one and deliberately stung himself, his son, and a local lifeguard, and observed the symptoms.[3]
