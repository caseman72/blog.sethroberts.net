L reuteri improved colicky symptoms in breastfed infants  within 1 week of treatment...

What&#039;s missing here is a riddle for Seth to solve like he did with &#039;Set Points&#039; in rat studies that were anomalies. There&#039;s no paradigm to shift.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kirk said &quot;Why can&#039;t Dannon Activia and similar products be produced without added sugar or fructose syrup?&quot; Well, obviously they can be, but the companies choose to add these junk ingredients because the mainstream American will not select such products to consume without the additional sweeteners. Dannon&#039;s first priority is to sell as many of their products as possible. Fortunately, there is a growing availability of pure cultured products at alternative sources such as Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and at some Farmer&#039;s Markets and other whole-food outlets. I suspect such outlets are not available equally across the US, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;The Probiotics Revolution is 90% filler&#039; was my impression also.  Some of the useful 10% included: 
(a) study of probiotics is in its infancy (which is why the book is full of &#039;probiotics hold promise to solve . . .&#039; statements)
(b) about a dozen well-designed experiments are discussued . . . more, please, I&#039;d like to see a book filled with discussions about hundreds of experiments
(c) dead bacteria still produce benefits . . . why?  there appear to be two theories: (1) dead bacteria adhere to the lining of the gastrointestinal tract thus crowding out harmful competitors or (2) the metabolic byproducts of fermentation have benefits.  I&#039;m looking forward to seeing this one resolved.

Many studies are listed at the end of the book, but, unfortunately, as a layman, I have no access to many of them, since most are behind a pay wall.

I suspect that much of the funding comes from the private sector looking for a magic bullet of probiotics which can be packaged and sold.  I wonder if there actually is an ideal combination of specific bacteria, or is it just that the internal system needs to be challenged by a certain amount on a regular basis?

Also, and this is more of a general gripe with the marketplace, why can&#039;t Dannon Activia and similar products be produced without added sugar or fructose syrup?]]></description>
