		<description><![CDATA[I have been taking EpiCor for a couple of years. 

It started as a supplement for livestock. The company found out that the factory workers got sick less than the office workers. So they started producing it for humans, too. 

I watched the webinar at 
http://www.vrp.com/webinar/epicor/index.aspx 
It has a lot of info, but I don&#039;t think they are exactly sure how it works yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you heard of Epicor?  It is a fermented yeast product feed to livestock under the Diamond V XPC label. It has some interesting history.

Humans are taking this as a supplement.
