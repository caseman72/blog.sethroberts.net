		<description><![CDATA[benetta, when I was a grad student I hired someone to make the graphs in my scientific publications. Now I make my own publication-quality graphs using R. Another example of a job disappearing is the disappearance of milkmen. I think that&#039;s basically what&#039;s happening to the recording industry. They are no longer needed to connect A (data, milk) and B (publication, milk drinker).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

	This reminds me very much of Walter Benjamin. If I recall, (the class was several years ago) about 70 years ago, he predicted the advent of the internet and blogging by analyzing the industrial development of books in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. In their early days, books were works of art created by scribes, extremely expensive and nearly impossible for the common individual to obtain. With the advent of the printing press came massive publishing houses, mass producing copies of books for those who were interested. Benjamin theorized that the natural evolution of this was to individualize production, basically describing the internet. 

 
scribe =&gt; publishing house =&gt; internet

In industrial terms, it means:
artisan production (one â€œauthentic work,â€ no duplicate copies) =&gt; centralized production (one â€œauthenticâ€ work, many duplicates mass produced) =&gt; decentralized production (there are no authentic or duplicate copies)

For advertising, it means:
â€œbook.â€ =&gt; â€œbook!â€ =&gt; â€œbook?â€ â€œbook!â€

And in terms of flow of information, it translates to:
simple =&gt; top down =&gt; bottom up + top down

Newspapers arenâ€™t the only organizations in decline. The recording industry and video rental industry are also struggling, thanks to new methods of communicating goods like Netflix and iTunes. The recording industry is doubly hit, as even individual artists donâ€™t really need them anymore. If you want to get your name out there as a musician, just make your own page on Myspace and watch the numbers fly. A few friends of mine were able to tour Europe that way.

A side effect of this, I think, is also an influx of variety and wider spread of wealth. For example, instead of having 5 or 6 sponsored superstars/multimillionaires touring the world, now you have several thousand regular stars making a decent living and doing what you want. At least this appears to have been true for my friends.

Advertising will never die, but industries that cannot or fail to adept to this new environment will fail. By refusing to adapt to the internet, the RIAA essentially dug its own grave.

Does this sound accurate?]]></description>
