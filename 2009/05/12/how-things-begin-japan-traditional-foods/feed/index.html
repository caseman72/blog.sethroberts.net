		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for responding, Seth.   I know natto itself is gluten-free but I tried to buy a container of natto recently, after hearing about it for the first time, and every different brand I picked up had wheat listed as an ingredient in the soy sauce.  Those of us who are gluten intolerant can&#039;t handle even a little wheat in soy sauce.  I wonder if natto with gluten free soy sauce is out there somewhere.... 
thanks again]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Patrik,

Blog comments are singularly ill-adapted for discussing complex topics. It may be better if you email Seth directly regarding specific topics. I&#039;ve noticed plenty of bloggers often only reply to the easiest and most lowest-common-denominator comments. It&#039;s a time-management and resource issue. 

I have yet to find a platform for such discussions that beats email. 

I do agree with many of your points and would like to see them addressed, but I know both you and Seth will have difficulties digging even one more level deeper on these concepts if you try to do it via blog comments.]]></description>

&quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Injection of live but not dead bacteria induces a wave of IL-12 and subsequently, IFN-Î³ production.&lt;/b&gt; Surprisingly, in vitro, both live and dead bacteria elicit IL-12 from macrophages. Better understanding of how macrophages distinguish live from dead bacteria would help explain this difference and possibly bypass the need for live vaccines against intracellular bacteria.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Live meningococcal bacteria were found to be poorly phagocytosed by dendritic cells compared to killed bacteria &lt;b&gt;and the special messenger molecules (cytokines) produced by dendritic cells in response to live and dead bacteria were quite different.&lt;/b&gt; Unexpectedly, the live bacteria stimulated more IL12 required for a good immune response and less IL10, a cytokine thought to inhibit the immune response. This finding is important for developing dead whole bacteria vaccines which are made using the whole bacterium rather than purified components of it, and for understanding how live bacteria in the host affect the immune response.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had the same reaction as Joe&#039;s &quot;instinctively feel right&quot; regarding the fermented food benefits. About a year ago I hadn&#039;t had any yogurt or fermented food for several years and happened to try some non-sugary plain yogurt from a local producer whose label promises lots of live bacteria. I suddenly craved yogurt and ate a jar a week for several months. But then I started getting a rash (I suspect due to the diary in the yogurt) and stopped eating it (and the rash did go away). When you posted about Kombucha and other fermented foods I was reminded of my craving for yogurt. 

With Omega-3s you provided a number of effects that you noticed (e.g. gum health, improved balance, improved performance on certain tests, longer sleep if taken before bed). I&#039;m surprised that you haven&#039;t listed anything similar for fermented food (or perhaps I didn&#039;t notice it). Some of these I could duplicate.

I&#039;ve been drinking 16 oz of Kombucha most days for the past two weeks or so and also made some miso soup and have continued to eat soy yogurt. 
I can say that my digestive system seems to be calmer than it&#039;s ever been before. Also drinking a bottle of Kombucha instead of breakfast satisfies any hunger even though the Kombucha has only 30 calories. But generally, I don&#039;t quantify enough of my daily life to notice effects with the accuracy and confidence that you can. When I read about the effects of Kombucha, the claims are so sweeping that they&#039;re implausible. Have you noticed any short-term effects or do you have ideas of things that could be measured before and after starting a high fermented food diet?

Thanks,
David]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Joe. Yeah, drying a product probably kills the bacteria. I think dead bacteria are probably helpful too -- the immune system can&#039;t distinguish live from dead -- but the drying process may also cause the bacteria to crumble into tiny bits which the immune system wouldn&#039;t notice. Certainly dead bacteria can&#039;t help your digestion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m absolutely fascinated by your theories on fermented food, Seth.  Intinctively they feel right to me too so last week i bought some Miso and Sauerkraut.  To my suprise, I&#039;m really enjoying the Umami-ness of Miso.

Once conern I have is buying the right stuff with all its fermented-goodness intact.  For example, in the UK it&#039;s actually easier to buy non-fermented Sauerkraut, that uses vinegar, than fermented-Sauerkraut.  Often, unless a product uses the word &#039;fermented&#039; on the label you might be getting the wrong stuff.

Likewise with Natto.  In the UK it seems much easier to buy dried Natto snacks (eg: http://www.japancentre.com/?cmd=itm&amp;cid=&amp;id=2788).  Any idea if the process of &#039;drying&#039; a product kills the bacteria?

Keep up the good work.]]></description>
