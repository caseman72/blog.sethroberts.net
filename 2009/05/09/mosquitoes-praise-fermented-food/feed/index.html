		<description><![CDATA[Huffnagle in The Probiotics Revolution says that the metabolic byproducts of probiotics provide a health benefit, even if the food has been heated enough to kill the bacteria.   One study he mentioned used three groups; the first received cold yogurt with live bacteria, the second received that same bacteria which had previously been heated, and the third received unfermented milk.  &#039;Live bacteria produced the most benefits; unfermented milk gave the least.  But the heated yogurt fell somewhere in between.&#039;  He labels these byproducts &#039;metabiotics&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[do jars of fish, etc., in brine, oil, and vinegar count as fermented foods? Not brine, which inhibits bacteria, but basically any food at room temperature will accumulate more bacteria than the same food stored cold. I suspect however there are vast differences in the potency of fermented foods -- some are far more beneficial than others. Although cooking kills bacteria, the dead bacteria may still be recognized as &quot;strange&quot; by the immune system and thus keep it awake.]]></description>

Also, I was just wondering whether jars of fish and other foods in brine, oil and vinegar count as fermented foods, along with pickles?]]></description>
