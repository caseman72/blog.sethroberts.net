		<description><![CDATA[next time you are in new york, try HANGAWI : korean vegetarian.  They know how to ferment.  Though at home japanese eat lots of fermented foods, miso and a bit of pickle is as far as it usually goes in japanese restaurants.  Exported and restaurant -wise, korean is the ticket, because generally anything you order comes with a major spread of pickled things.   Come to think of it... maybe that&#039;s one of the reasons why korean-americans often tend to be notably chubby  - because they aren&#039;t getting enough kimchee!]]></description>
