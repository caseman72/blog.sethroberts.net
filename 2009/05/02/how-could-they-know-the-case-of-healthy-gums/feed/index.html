		<description><![CDATA[Morris, that&#039;s a fascinating and revealing story. Thanks for your comment. Perhaps your gums and other things have gotten better because you have reduced pro-inflammatory molecules (such as omega-6) in your food. Omega-3 is anti-inflammatory. Grains have much more omega-6 than other foods. I don&#039;t think gut inflammation causes inflammation elsewhere but it is an indication of too much pro-inflammatory signalling and/or too-little anti-inflammatory signalling in the whole body-- in other words, it is a sign of a whole system out of balance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth
I discovered the connection between gum disease (similar to yours it seems) and nutrition but my conclusions are different. Following my GP&#039;s advice I moved my USDA diet to one with less meat, more legumes etc and suffered a marked worsening of gums plus other aging bio-markers which I did not recognize at the time. So I moved gradually in the opposite direction, eliminated all grains &amp; legumes and now (1 year on) about 75% of energy comes form fats. For reasons I will not go into, I believe root of the problem was inflammation of the gut and consequent inflammation of connective tissues (gums, joints). My caloric intake has slowly increased by almost 50% while maintaing a BMI of 23. This makes no sence from the conventional understanding of metabolism but I trust my observations (many improvements) over theory. It is possible that my experience is a transient phenomenon, but time will tell and so far it&#039;s holding.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[wgi, thanks for your comment but I fear you are missing the point.Â  I agree, someone close to farming realized that farmers could benefit from tractors. Yes, farmers made small improvements in farming. Jane Jacobs&#039;s point was that the really big improvements, such as tractors, never began with farmers. To invent tractors you had to invent engines, and tires, and so on...farmers never did that. A farmer might have taken the last tiny step but couldn&#039;t have taken that step without a vast amount of invention by non-farmers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, but you and your reference are wrong about farmers inventing tractors. I grew up on a dryland wheat farm. Innovation was a part of daily life. Dad and Uncles were always looking for a better way to do things. A friend of Dad&#039;s, needing a bigger tractor, took the front wheels off two tractors, hooked the front of one to the reinforced hitch of the other, making a pivot point.  He used the hydraulics of the front one to steer, and linked the throttles together.

Friends asked him to build one for them, so he built a jig.

On the farm, we were always fixing things, trying new ways.  Technology was a significant part of daily life.

&quot;Busy Farming&quot; means fixing things, making them better.

I would be willing to bet that the actual inventors of tractors grew up on farms.

To say &quot;They didnâ€™t invent any of the improvements&quot; is just flat wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Patrick

Thanks for the link. I recently bought some excellent raw cheese and grassfed butter from a vendor at my local farmer&#039;s market (Culver City, CA). It&#039;s operated by a funny French guy wearing an Australian bush huntsman&#039;s hat (he looks a bit like Crocodile Dundee). The butter is the best I&#039;ve ever had and it comes from New Zealand. It is so yellow (I assume due to its high vitamin content) and creamy. I sometimes place a small sample in my mouth and take great pleasure in how it slowly melts, releasing rich flavors. It&#039;s as good as any fine, soft cheese.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eric,

I had the same thought, so I stopped using mouthwash now that I&#039;ve moved closer to the paleo diet. I still eat some grains, but try to avoid wheat and whole grains if they haven&#039;t been sprouted or fermented. I also eat chocolate and ice cream a little bit and drink coffee every day, and wine or beer with my dinner. But I try to end my lunch and dinner with raw cheese because cheese has been shown to be beneficial to the enamel. I&#039;ll see at my next dentist visit in September whether I did the right thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eric, I think my gums were red due to immune system overreaction. Because of too little bacteria everywhere in my body, not just my mouth.

Nansen, the fermented food didn&#039;t replace anything except the use of spices. Eating 300 calories of fermented food probably made me eat 300 calories less overall, but no foods were eliminated, I just ate less of everything else.]]></description>
