		<description><![CDATA[I first read about that decades ago in a truely wonderful book, http://isbn.nu/9780801493676 Listening in the Dark Acoustic Orientation in Bats and Men, by Donald Griffin.    It&#039;s surprisingly easy to do once your realize the signal is there, and yes making a bit of noise to can help.  About half the blind people I&#039;ve mentioned it to are aware of it.   Griffin mentions one guy you could sense the parking meters along the street, but when they removed them leaving only the posts he couldn&#039;t &#039;see&#039; them anymore.   The resolution of the signal being determined by the spread of your ears.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reminded of John Boyd, the military theorist, who came up with an idea that we make decisions in &quot;Observe-orient-decide-act&quot; cycles.  More or less, you view the world, come up with a mental model, decide what to do, and then act.  You repeat the cycle over and over.  If you can do these cycles quicker than your opponent, you get more info about the battlefield quicker, giving you an advantage.  Self-experimenters seem to go through their OODA loop or decision cycle quicker than academic experimenters.]]></description>
