Deserning customers will ask for a piece of well hung rib of beef or filet steak but to be honest I have never been asked for hung ground mince beef. Tim - the feel and overall smell of the nmince would be the telling factor regarding its continued shelf life. Mince will become somewhat slimy/sticky to the touch and will smell..]]></description>
