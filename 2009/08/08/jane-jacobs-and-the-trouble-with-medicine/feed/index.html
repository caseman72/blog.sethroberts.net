		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty optimistic that is status quo is changing and will change even more.  Over time the balance of power of between doctor and patient will shift, or has started to shift, towards the patient.  CureTogether is just one example.

This is another:  http://www.blog.sethroberts.net.  If Seth&#039;s theories are even modestly correct (eg Omega-3 improves gums), the balance of power between, say, periodontists and patients will shift greatly.

Another is my friend, a lawyer with no medical training, who after being diagnosed with a rare stomach condition undertook to learn all he could about it.  Within about a month he knew as much or more about it than the doctors who were supposed to treat him for it.  

The common denominator is the explosion in the quantity and accessibility of information made possible by the internet.  Doctors tend to hate the internet because they say it&#039;s full of crackpot theories.  Which is true, but the solution is not less internet, but better filters of the information on it.  Veblen might say doctors hate the internet because of the challenge it presents to their status.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, yeah, that&#039;s a very good point about ignoring the patient in discussions about how to improve health care. Which basically means the discussion about health care is mainly among those who like the status quo. Nothing would be more subversive of the status quo than giving more power to patients.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I largely agree with your analysis (and have used Jacob&#039;s framework in thinking about this issue for years) AND with Schwartz and Sharpe.  Though their recommendation is vague, it points weakly in the guardian direction.  They don&#039;t say how to do it, but the obvious solution is something along the lines of making doctors a type of professor, as their name implies, with tenure, legal protection from malpractice (risk of loss of tenure, not financial loss), and a professorial level salary and career path.  They should be banned for providing medical services for pay, or rather, should lose tenure for some fairly long period and the right to call themselves a doctor of medicine plus malpractice insurance for doing so.

Pharmacists as well as MDs should be empowered to prescribe drugs, not on the basis of their own diagnosis, but on the basis of a diagnosis from an expert system plus a general confirmation that the patient is of sound mind etc and understands risks and interactions associated with the drug.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, you get a gold star for speaking up to your surgeon. Nearly all of such discussions about how-to-reform-health-care ignore the patient. It is just assumed that they are ignorant and stupid concerning their health and medical treatment. If that is a given, then it is just a question of whether the patient will be shafted by fee-for-service or shafted by fee-for-patient.]]></description>
