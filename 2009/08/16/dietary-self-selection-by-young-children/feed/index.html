		<description><![CDATA[We have come to think that anything not &quot;controlled&quot; by us is suspect.  Therefore we have lost our ability to trust our instincts and intuition and depend on man-ufactured processes to keep us safe and healthy.  We&#039;ve changed so much but I think we can still draw on that universal inner voice for much of our well-being.  But we need to eliminate a lot of the useless input that bombards us every waking minute.  Then we will be able to listen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nadav,
The US has a long history of discarding really good ideas that come back to us as &quot;foreign mystery&quot; and are wildly popular.
1.  Deming and quality movement was invented in the US.  Japan adoped his techniques and kicked US manufacturing butt.  
2.  The Beatles and Rolling Stones took US Blues and repackaged it for the US.  

There&#039;s two points, I can draw a straight line on my graph. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

What do you think are the main institutional reasons why remarkable experiments from so long ago like this one don&#039;t &quot;catch on,&quot; and instead seem to be forgotten by the scientific mainstream, only to be rediscovered decades later by people who care enough to look?  &quot;Good Calories, Bad Calories&quot; is a prime example: Gary Taubes simply went back and looked at the studies that had been done before the current consensus on obesity was formed, which led him to challenge that consensus.

Thanks,
Nadav]]></description>
