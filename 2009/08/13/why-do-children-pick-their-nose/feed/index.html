		<description><![CDATA[When I was a kid, I actually ate ants sometimes. Not often and I was under the age of 5, based on my last memory of doing it. 

I&#039;d step on the ant (didn&#039;t want to eat one alive) and then eat it. I&#039;ve read since that sometimes children do this who need iron, but given my diet (my mother was a health food nut with us early and had all kinds of nutritional boosters) I somehow doubt I needed much iron.

Does make me wonder.

It was always the black ants, not the little red ones. I have no idea -- to this day -- why I did it.  But I&#039;d love to think it was a toddler instinct that was good rather than some weird issue.

I didn&#039;t massacre any ants, by the way -- just a few over a year or so, as far as I can recall.]]></description>
