		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, a distraction? Then why mention it? I thought you made an interesting point about the &quot;tax on&quot; usage. To say I &quot;don&#039;t think college is a good thing&quot; is too simple. I think current versions of post-high-school education (= college) work well for a small subset of students. Let&#039;s say 20%. For the remaining 80%, I think that 40% of them would benefit more from a different sort of college (less emphasis on what professors want to teach, more emphasis on what students want to learn) and 40% would benefit from having the requirement of having to go to college removed.

Aaron, your comment appeared as I was typing the above. I see we agree.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with some points each of you make. I think college is very valuable, but at the same time I think there is such a higher expectation that everyone go to college (as if it&#039;s a right, not a privilege) that many more people attend college nowadays who shouldn&#039;t than back in the 30s, 60s, perhaps even in the 80s. But again, &quot;college&quot; is not just one thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:

And the health care system is a tax on everybody who&#039;s not a doctor or a nurse, and the public water supply is a tax on everybody who isn&#039;t a plumber, and public buildings are a tax on everybody who isn&#039;t a bricklayer, zoos are a tax on everybody who isn&#039;t a zookeeper, etc.

The &quot;is a tax on&quot; framing is a distraction, I think.  The real point is that you and I disagree about the value of college. I think college is a good thing, you don&#039;t.  If you think something is a good thing, you don&#039;t mind that people get paid to do it.  If you don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good thing, it&#039;s natural to get annoyed about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding your last point, don&#039;t forget that Coca-Cola is a tax on everyone who isn&#039;t Michael Jordan (who whoever their current spokesmodel is), and of course don&#039;t forget that your local Dept. of Parks and Recreation is a tax on everyone who isn&#039;t a lifeguard.]]></description>
