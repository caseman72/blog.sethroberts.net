		<description><![CDATA[I can definitely believe that the supplement helped reduce the number and severity of the colds.

If people only realized how much our diet has changed over the last few decades.  We use to eat a variety of fermented foods.  Every culture seemed to have a basic ferment - whether it was sauerkraut or yogurt or cheese or whatever.  Food use to do what we now need to take probiotic supplements for - but if we returned to plenty of raw fruit and vegetables and some sort of fermented food on a regular basis, we wouldn&#039;t need to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] As I previously blogged, a recent study in Shanghai found that schoolchildren given milk with added bacteria had fewer colds than children given milk without added bacteria. The study was funded by Danisco, a Wisconsin company that makes bacteria-containing (&#8221;probiotic&#8221;) capsules. Obviously they want to sell more of their product. But ordinary yogurt probably produces the same result. Aaron Blaisdell told me this: Since introducing yogurt into my daughter Maggie&#8217;s diet on a daily basis about 5 months ago, she&#8217;s gotten far fewer colds, and those she did get were milder.

		<description><![CDATA[John, I do not get flu shots and for about ten years I&#039;ve almost never had any obvious cold or flu symptoms either. I&#039;m sure the reason is that I sleep really well so my body fights off the viruses. Before I started sleeping much better, I did get colds. This summer I&#039;m believe I had either a cold or a flu -- probably swine flu -- but I barely noticed it. On one day I felt tired and for the next two weeks my legs were weaker than usual. So I believe that with (a) good sleep and (b) enough fermented food, your immune system will work well enough that when you get sick (infected), your body will fight off the infection so fast you won&#039;t suffer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I know you&#039;re not practicing medicine here, but I&#039;d be very interested to hear your thoughts on the three (!) flu shots the government wants us all to get this fall. Do you plan to get them yourself, and why or why not? Do you know of any downsides to flu shots? (In prior years, I&#039;ve always got the recommended flu shot. But after all I&#039;ve been reading here about kombucha and other probiotics, I&#039;m wondering if that&#039;s necessary or desirable.)]]></description>
