		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking about the timing of response to flaxseed oil.  The CNS improvement happens way too fast to be a nutritional effect, particularly considering that you take the stuff regularly and so can&#039;t be deficient.  What it looks like to me is a drug response.  (I note that my pinball scores double shortly after taking it.)

Is there a plausible mechanism for flax oil -- not necessarily the n3 component! -- to have a fast CNS stimulant effect?

I also wonder how much of the effect is a result of absorption in the mouth.  I&#039;m going to experiment with flushing it around in my mouth for a while before swallowing, and maybe without swallowing.]]></description>
