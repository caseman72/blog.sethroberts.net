		<description><![CDATA[Not sure if you&#039;ve tried making your own kefir, yet? You can get cultures for it online...I&#039;ve made my own from cultures...very easy to make, and I&#039;ve also used commercial brands available at supermarkets and health-food stores. 

I also like using a probiotic containing HSOs (homeostatic soil organisms lacking in our diet) from Garden of Life products, called Primal Defense. I use a variety of fermented pre/probiotic foods including kefir, kombucha, yogurt... and add to that, Primal Defense (mainly because of the HSO ingredient). Not advertising...I don&#039;t know if any other company&#039;s probiotic formulae include HSOs in their complexes.]]></description>
