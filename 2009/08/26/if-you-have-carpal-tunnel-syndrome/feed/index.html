		<description><![CDATA[[...] In an earlier post I wrote, &#8220;Hypothyroidism is so common I suspect an environmental cause.&#8221; In fact, I suspect that all common diseases are caused (= made much more likely by) differences between modern life and Stone-Age life. Since then, thanks to comments and email, I have learned more about hypothyroidism. According to Dennis Mangan, it has become a lot more common during the last 100 years, which implies an environmental cause. The most common type of hypothroidism is called Hashimoto&#8217;s thyroiditis. It is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid, damaging it. A reader with hypothyroidism wrote me: When I was first tested for thyroid levels, part of the test (which I think is standard protocol) was to test the level of antibodies to thyroid. My levels were off the charts. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fear of salt (iodine deficiency = hypothyroidism) + fear of fat (increased refined carbohydrates = obesity, diabetes, heart disease, etc.) + fear of the sun (Vitamin D deficiency = depressed immunity, depression, hypothyroidism) + fear of bacteria (depressed immunity) = pretty sucky health for modern humans.

And if you look at the iodine and Vitamin D effects on thyroid, then combine that with the increased sugar-based calorie increase...that;&#039;s not a good combo.

We&#039;ve created a perfect storm here, doncha think? It would be hard to design an environment that would more efficiently lead to bad health.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two things: Vitamin D deficiency and Iodine deficiency.

Google either one and you&#039;ll find a lot of references.

I&#039;ve been taking thyroid for years for hypothyroidism. When I upped my Vitamin D intake to 2,000-4,000 IU/day, I found I could cut my thyroid dose in half. (And I&#039;ve also not been sick in over two and one-half years, to which I attribute the D.)]]></description>
