		<description><![CDATA[I ordered a jersey from lightinshopping.com recently. I was not scammed! I ordered on Jan 24, got a tracking number a week later, and got my jersey today. So it does take a long time from order date to receiving the jersey (approx a month), but I did get the jersey for a great price! I can give any more details if you want them. Just ask.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks like I have been scammed as well by lightinstore.com.  Ordered Green Bay jersey early in December and have not received as of the 20th.  I sent 2 emails to their service center and 1 to a Paul Zhang who has corresponded with me prior to placing the order with NO RESPONSE.   However, I did use credit card and hopefully they can reverse the charges.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had purchased $526 US from myshopinsun.com using PayPal and I too was scammed.I ordered Sept.29,2009 and by mid Oct. had found this blog with all these reports of scam. I contacted PayPal immediately, filed a complaint and though they found in my favor, none of my money was recovered/refunded.I did go ahead and file a complaint with ic3.gov but don&#039;t feel like it did any good.After finding out that there were new websites from the same vendor, again backed by PayPal, I decided to try filing a complaint with the better business bureau. I filed against Paypal for knowing that people were being scammed and still allowing other transactions instead of suspending them until investigation was complete. Don&#039;t know if it will do any good, but I&#039;m trying. There has got to be some way for us to get our money back. PayPal cannot get away with this. At the very least, they should refund their cut of our money they received from the vendor. Why should they be allowed to keep money from a bad transaction? There has just got to be a way. I also filed a report on econsumer.gov against the vendor. Again, just hoping that somehow something will work. We can&#039;t give up.]]></description>
