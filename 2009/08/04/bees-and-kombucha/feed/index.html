		<description><![CDATA[I was reading today that since honey has antibacterial properties that it shouldn&#039;t be used to make kombucha.  
Do you have an opinion?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my experience kombucha can be bad in three ways: 1. Too sour. Too close to vinegar. 2. Too weak flavor. Which means I didn&#039;t use enough tea. 3. Too strong flavor. Which means I used too much tea. I could use it to store kombucha mothers or use it to jumpstart another batch. If I had too sour kombucha today I would do an experiment: start 4 new jars of kombucha (tea + sugar + kombucha mother). In two jars I&#039;d put some of the sour kombucha, in the other two jars I&#039;d put nothing. Then see if there was a difference after two weeks. Perhaps the bad kombucha can speed up later batches of good kombucha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

That was my gut instinct: my organic garden would probably remain the same. Any sort of perceived change would probably be from additional nutrients in the kombucha (acids, vitamins, sugars, and whatnot) and not the bacteria itself.

And bees feeding off of my garden? Why would they need the extra bacteria? They probably wouldn&#039;t. Certainly not in my garden. Granted, an organic home garden in Northern California isn&#039;t exactly a purely &quot;natural&quot; environment, but it&#039;s not a hospital or freezer.

I guess the question remains. What to do with kombucha if it comes out tasting bad, without throwing it away?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[bennetta you are right: kombucha made with honey would be very very bad to spray on hives! I think your garden is already teeming with bacteria, so I wouldn&#039;t expect kombucha to help. Yeah, why should bees living in artificial hives be bacteria-deficient, which is what this observation suggests? The bees are eating natural food -- aren&#039;t they? Or perhaps they are eating food that is unnaturally low in bacteria.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting.

And then you could use the honey as food for your kombucha!

Actually, that brings up an interesting question: what else benefits from bacteria cultures? I&#039;m in the process of whipping up a pair of two gallon jugs of kombucha and was trying to figure out what to do with it if it ends up tasting bad. I was thinking about maybe using it as fertilizer and seeing what my garden thinks of it.]]></description>
