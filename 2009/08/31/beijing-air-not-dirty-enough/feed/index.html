		<description><![CDATA[This is probably the most discussed recent publication on the subject:
http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/360/4/376

The finding is that up to 15% of the increase in life expectency in the US is attributable to better air quality.  They compared particulate levels across cities.  With your background, I&#039;d love to see your critique of the method used.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yo, if the eggs in question are pi-dan ï¼ˆçš®è›‹ï¼‰ be careful about eating too many; some are very high in zinc due to shortcuts in the fermentation process.  others supposedly even have lead.  they&#039;re really delicious though--I almost want to go through a few brands and have a chem lab test for the aforementioned so i can eat them in peace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Smog &quot;reduces life expectancy by up to a couple years&quot;? Where did you learn that? I heard a talk a year ago about the effects of air pollution. It was really hard to show any effect. The only clear effect was for people who lived close to a highway and they had increases on the order of 30% in respiratory illnesses. That is a long way from a 2-year reduction in life expectancy. I told the speaker I was moving to Beijing. Unlikely to be harmful, he said.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The runny nose is probably allergies, which can vary in severity from year to year (and continent to continent).  But if more smog fixes it, I&#039;d say the cure is worse than the disease, seeing as how it reduces life expectancy by up to a couple years.]]></description>
