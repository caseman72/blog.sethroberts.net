[[my experience with Kombucha is that too much is bad (i feel slightly ill), but that i can take 2 table spoons about every other day...]]

Then you have serious internal systemic issues. I donâ€™t know if you are just whining like alot of people do. You can probably drink 10 cups of coffee daily w/o a problem but a mere 2 tablespoons makes you ill???!!! This is just nonsensical rhetoric. Most people comsume a bare minimum of 4 oz when STARTING, and progress from there. There is no upper limit, it is how your body reacts. Some drink up to a gallon. The average for most is probably 16-32 ounces daily.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[my experience with Kombucha is that too much is bad (i feel slightly ill), but that i can take 2 table spoons about every other day and one of many sources of fermented food.  (i really don&#039;t know if it&#039;s doing me any good; but based on what i&#039;ve read i probably does).
    to take a lot of one thing on a daily basis probably is not a good idea.  i&#039;m guided by the principle that one should seek a variety of sources of fermented foods in moderate amounts; the same can probably be said of other foods as well.]]></description>
