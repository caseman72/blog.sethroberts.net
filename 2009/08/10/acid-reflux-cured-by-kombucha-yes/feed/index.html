		<description><![CDATA[[...] This is also a reason that theory is important. John Tukey, the statistician, spoke of &#8220;gathering strength&#8221; when analyzing data. It is rare that a single body of data tells you how to analyze it, he said. (For example, what transformation to use.) You should use similar data sets to help decide. Scientific theory has the same effect. Before I started drinking kombucha, I didn&#8217;t have obvious digestive problems (unlike a friend) and my immune system seemed to work well. So it wasn&#8217;t easy to measure its effect. Yet I drink it and am untroubled by the evidence that worries RVM because I have a theory: the umami hypothesis (that we need a steady intake of bacteria to be healthy). This allows me to assess the effect of kombucha &#8212; whether it is likely to be good or bad &#8212; with the help of evidence from other bacteria-rich food (yogurt, natto, etc.) and much different data (the effect of bee stings on arthritis, epidemiology, the effects of turmeric, etc.). Because the umami hypothesis appears to be true, apparently bacteria intake is beneficial &#8212; and kombucha has lots of bacteria. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure enough, you did say &quot;perhaps&quot;, and I didn&#039;t read carefully enough.

I asked at Berkeley Natural Grocery about kombucha starter, and they said they didn&#039;t have it and didn&#039;t know anybody who did.  Then I thought of starting a colony from the bottled stuff, and sure enough people do that.  One of the FAQs suggested &quot;continuous fermentation&quot; in a &quot;sun tea&quot; jar, where you draw some off from the spigot and then add more tea.  That seemed to me most practical.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for explaining that, Nathan. My friend isn&#039;t drinking much kombucha. I&#039;m pretty sure if he drank more the condition would go away completely. He doesn&#039;t eat any fermented food apart from the kombucha. Yeah, I suspect if he changed his diet and ate other fermented foods, such as yogurt, he would no longer need to drink kombucha.
I don&#039;t &quot;decide up front&quot; that fermented food has no effect on stomach cancer. I wrote &quot;perhaps their stomach cancer rate is high because their food is really salty, not because itâ€™s fermented.&quot; Note the &quot;perhaps.&quot; I think we agree that a range of possibilities should be considered.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Seth, curing means the condition goes away.  Scurvy is caused by forcing people to eat bad food, and cured by letting patients eat what they choose.  Vitamin C treats the acute condition.  Kombucha treats acute acid reflux.  Dietary changes may cure it.  Kombucha might serve as a substitute for those dietary changes, just as taking vitamin (etc.) supplements may substitute eating for good food.

There&#039;s no evidence to blame stomach cancer on salt instead of fermented food, is there?  Maybe it&#039;s salt, maybe it&#039;s bacteria, maybe it&#039;s something else entirely.  To decide up front that the fermented food can&#039;t have a role is just wishful thinking.  Quantities matter.  Vitamin A prevents all kinds of problems, but too much kills.  It wouldn&#039;t be at all surprising if it were demonstrated we need to eat at least X mg of bacteria, and can tolerate up to nX, but more causes problems. Amounts of different strains matter too.  The beneficial dosage of salmonella is probably fairly low.  Science doesn&#039;t tell us until we do the work.  Assuming interferes with doing the work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can imagine that the cancer is a real problem for people who are directly affected by it, but beside that, statistical data speak for themselves.

Generaly I see only two major problems with our diet: tons and tons of products made from refined while flour, and tons and tons of sweets. Replace that with something better, and Czech diet will become pretty sound (I should say that I don&#039;t see animal fats and red meat as a problem, as their supposed harmfulness is not being proved by science, and never was). That&#039;s of course pure fantasy :) Lots of people are still cooking at home (perhaps even most of them), so better choice of ingredients and methods of preparition would make a big difference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi bennetta,
I am also personally familiar with Czechs, that&#039;s because I am one of them :)

Little statistics about colorectal cancer in Czech Republic for you. I just looked it up using official statistics published by Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic:

2006
new cases: 152
died: 82

2005:
new cases: 156
died: 83

2004:
new cases: 158
died: 90

Total population: about 10 millions. Huge problem? No. And it even looks like a downtrend. Please do not let confuse yourself with press releases doing relative comparitions with other European countries. Absolute incidence is very small. In fact, number of death on colorectal cancer is lower then number of death on AIDS, and incidence of AIDS in Czech Rep. is very low.

Source: http://www.uzis.cz/cz/dps/english/index.html
Diagnoses: C18-C21 for both man and woman

Now about your ideas about digestion.

Human colon is not a digestive organ, even though some digestion happens there thanks to fermentative microorganisms, but the fatty acids produced by them are used mainly for colon nourishment (about 100 calories per day). Fats are absorbed in small intestine, as are absorbable parts of fermented foods.

I will end with the relevant link:

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t understand the distinction you are making. What&#039;s the difference between &quot;curing&quot; something and &quot;[successfully] treating&quot; it? In this example, the problem didn&#039;t entirely disappear but it certainly is cause and effect (more kombucha, less acid reflux). If by &quot;cure&quot; you mean get rid of so that you don&#039;t need the treatment any more, then Vitamin C doesn&#039;t cure scurvy, because you have to keep taking Vitamin C.
Bennetta, the Japanese eat a good amount of fermented food and have much higher rates of stomach cancer and much lower rates of heart disease than Americans. I don&#039;t know what their colon cancer rate is. But perhaps their stomach cancer rate is high because their food is really salty, not because it&#039;s fermented. Might be the explanation for the Vietnamese, too -- all that salty fermented fish sauce. Like the Japanese and their salty fermented soy sauce.

Because of our liking for umami, sour, and complex flavors, I believe we need fermented foods to make up for the lack of bacteria in the rest of our food. It isn&#039;t a tradeoff (between colon cancer and stomach cancer); it&#039;s a deficiency being met.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t overdo it, though!

Here&#039;s a bit of information you might find interesting, Seth, regarding stomach problems and probiotics. My room mate has a very good friend who is Vietnamese and a surgeon, practicing in the US. According to him, Vietnamese eat a lot of fermented food, but not much fatty food.  In the US, however, we do the opposite- eat a lot of fatty food, but barely any fermented food. In Vietnam, colon cancer is relatively rare, while stomach cancer is a real problem. Again, in the US, the opposite is true: we have low rates of stomach cancer, with colon cancer being much more common.

Digestion of fats takes place primarily in the colon, while digestion of fermented foods is almost exclusively a stomach affair.

You can probably see where I&#039;m going with this. According to him, just look to whatever the bulk of digestion is taking place to see where the cancer will be. This seems to be the case in other cultures, as well. Czechs (a group I am personally familiar with) also eat a lot of fatty foods and colon cancer is a huge problem for them.

Still, here in America, we could probably afford to eat a LOT more fermented food than we currently do. Overdoing it might be next to impossible.

<p>Here&#8217;s a bit of information you might find interesting, Seth, regarding stomach problems and probiotics. My room mate has a very good friend who is Vietnamese and a surgeon, practicing in the US. According to him, Vietnamese eat a lot of fermented food, but not much fatty food.  In the US, however, we do the opposite- eat a lot of fatty food, but barely any fermented food. In Vietnam, colon cancer is relatively rare, while stomach cancer is a real problem. Again, in the US, the opposite is true: we have low rates of stomach cancer, with colon cancer being much more common.</p>
<p>Digestion of fats takes place primarily in the colon, while digestion of fermented foods is almost exclusively a stomach affair.</p>
