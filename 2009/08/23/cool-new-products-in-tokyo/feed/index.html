		<description><![CDATA[The Papermate pens smudge -- any abrasion would rub off the marks -- and the ink has a faded color even when it&#039;s brand new.

The Frixion pens are amazing -- colors are rich.  They erase with heat -- what looks like &quot;erasing&quot; is really heating the paper so that the ink becomes invisible.  (Interestingly, it will re-appear if you put the paper in the freezer.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[3D TVs that need glasses are old stuff, and nobody has even tried to sell them because, it seems, nobody would buy them.  At NAB I saw several attempts at no-glasses screens (panasonic, phillips); all were unsatisfactory -- blurry, muddy, jumpy.  I saw one that was perfect in every way.  However, it required five times the video data fed to it that a normal screen takes, and live action would need to be shot with multiple cameras and heavily processed.  Synthetic content (e.g. Pixar) would snap right in, if you could deliver the frames fast enough.

Once Blu-ray data disc drives are commonplace, the market might be ready for it.  Probably by the time that happens, movies that could benefit from 3D will be synthetic anyway, with all the &quot;live action&quot; shots synthesized, perhaps from actors wearing skintight outfits with dots on the joints, and sparkle gel on their faces, cavorting in front of greenscreens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve actually seen 3D TV without glasses here too, but only at trade fairs as a technology demo. This was at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas a few years ago. (brief google search...ah, here we go):

So where did you see this? Were you at a trade show, or just bumping around akihabara?]]></description>
