		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Glen, your argument is interesting but it sounds, forgive me, completely armchair.&lt;/i&gt;
I was wrong. People &lt;i&gt;living near&lt;/i&gt; a nuclear power plant are protected to the degree I implied; people working in one aren&#039;t. According to James P Hogan&#039;s essay &quot;Know Nukes&quot; (which I read ages ago), the granite in New York&#039;s Grand Central Station naturally emits more radiation than a nuclear plant is allowed to emit, so people who work there are getting a significant annual dose of radiation, but because we&#039;re not *afraid* of granite, they don&#039;t wear radiation tags. I was extrapolating from that and a few other half-remembered factoids. So let&#039;s get some real numbers in here. A little googling finds these more-precise claims:

Background radiation (the radiation load from &quot;living on earth&quot; is about 200 mrems. The legal limit on workplace radiation exposure (for nuke workers, x-ray techs, etcetera) is 5000 mrems above background; the NRC claims average industry exposure is about 240 mrems over background; the exposure from being an employee at Grand Central Station is only half that, or 120 mrems. The average exposure from being an airline attendant or pilot is closer - 160 mrems. Medical X-ray technicians average 320 mrems, which is more than the average for nuke workers but not as *much* more than I expected it to be.

So there are some other professions that are in the same ballpark, but nuclear plant workers do get significant extra exposure relative to &quot;average workers&quot;. I withdraw my objection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Cancer frequency among [United Kingdom] nuclear power plant workers was lower than the national average (Kendal et al. 1992).&quot;

I&#039;m at least as enthusiastic about the idea of hormesis as the next guy but I have to object to that example as evidence for it. I strongly suspect that nuclear power plant workers are exposed to a lot *less* radiation than average workers. Nuclear power plant workers wear radiation tags, spend much of their time in a shielded environment and have people around them at work who are on the lookout for unusual levels of radiation; most workers don&#039;t. Because the danger is so obvious they are &lt;i&gt;overprotected&lt;/i&gt; against it, in much the same way that houses in snowy climates are extra-well protected against cold with insulation.

If you want to look for people likely to be exposed to &lt;i&gt;extra&lt;/i&gt; radiation by their jobs, try dentists. Or coal miners. Or people who work outdoors.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You mention radon, which is an area Phil and I&#039;ve worked on.  According to Phil, there has been some discussion of the potential protective effects of radon at low levels, but there&#039;s no convincing evidence of this.  As you say, it makes some sense, but it also makes sense that even low levels can hurt.]]></description>
