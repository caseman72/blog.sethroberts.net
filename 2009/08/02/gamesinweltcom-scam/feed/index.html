		<description><![CDATA[Daniel is correct in saying that PayPal is as guilty as the Chinese scammers. My husband also fell victim but he eventually got his money back from PalPay after a long long battle. I did some research and people who still did not get their money back could contact the Financial Ombudsman Service on 1300 780 808 for information about their complaint resolution service. If still unsuccessful in resolving the complaint, you may lodge an application with the Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal. The tribunal may have jurisdiction to hear a claim if the Paypal part of the contract took place in Australia. You can find information, forms and fee schedules for the tribunal at www.cttt.nsw.gov.au and a claim can be lodged on-line. I have also filed a report on the scams in the ACCC website naming the Chinese parties as well as asking ACCC to contact the Chinese Consulate. In turn, the Chinese Police could conduct a money trace through the scammersâ€™ respective accounts with PayPal to catch these criminals. The other alternative is to talk to your bank and exercise your credit card chargeback rights (but do it quick as I think banks have time limits on disputes).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[daniel
What PAYPAL are saying is that because the transaction was not made through an EBAY purchase, you are no longer covered by their protection. It sucks. I made my purchase on 05 Aug.
This is my response from PAYPAL after appealing their decision.

After careful review, we have concluded our investigation of the Buyer
Complaint described below.
 
We have decided in your favour, however, we were unable to recover any
funds from the seller&#039;s account. As stated in the PayPal User Agreement,
recovery of funds associated with a Buyer Complaint cannot be guaranteed.
 
Please know that we will make our best effort to recover the funds in
question if they become available in the seller&#039;s account in the future,
and will take appropriate action against the seller. Such action may
include issuing a warning, a temporary restriction, or terminating the
account. Keep in mind that PayPal uses a number of factors, including
member complaints, to determine when to take action. Due to privacy laws,
we cannot discuss the details of any action taken. We hope you understand
our policy and that it reassures you that you are safe using PayPal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting to see how PayPal &quot;closed their eyes&quot; and allowed more and more people to be victimized by gamesinwelt/gamesingate scam.
PayPal allowed this to happen for a few weeks and used other people&#039;s money to issue refunds for the first claims... from my perspective that makes them as guilty as the chinese scammers.
I wonder when was this scam first brought to PayPal&#039;s attention? ... sounds like claims started to pile up around August 2nd or 3rd and I placed my order on august 5th!!!! ... HOW CAN PAYPAL SAY THAT THEY &quot;PROTECT&quot; MY PURCHASES WHEN MY ORDER WAS PLACED DAYS AFTER RECEIVING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CLAIMS FROM THIS SITE?
Anyone placed an order after August 5th? maybe we can start building a case from here...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did lodge a complaint against PayPal, an eBay company with the Department of Fair Trading and created a case. My argument is PayPal was aware of what&#039;s going on (with all the complaints they have been getting and some refunds they gave) and yet they made no attempt to protect our interest. If you read the conditions we accepted (which a lot of people didn&#039;t and unfortunately I was one of them), it offers no protection at all as nothing is guaranteed and is under the sole discretion of PayPal or eBay. We may have suffered a loss this time but we did learn a good lesson. We should warn our friends to be very careful of internet trading and agents like PayPal and eBay. As Laura says &quot;my opinion of PayPal has totally changed&quot; so PayPal has managed to ruin its reputation and in the long run, its business will suffer.  Let&#039;s spread it to the word!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SITE. It is a huge scam and they took me for $165.00. The only reason I decided to take a chance was because Paypal was offered as a payment method and I THOUGHT my money would be protected. WRONG!!!! Basically, they told me that since the purchase wasn&#039;t made from an auction site such as Ebay, they will only assist me in making a claim. Whoopity doo! They basically did nothing. Said they couldn&#039;t get the money from the company ( big shocker) and basically I am out of luck. I could have done that on my own and still gotten the same outcome. Not only am I disappointed by the site taking my money, my opinion of Paypal has totally changed]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,

Since Daniel &amp; Suzanne had got back their money from PayPal last week. I tried my luck to chase for my lost from PayPal. To my disappointment I rec&#039;d a letter telling me how secured PayPal would be and we should keep on using it in order to protect our fund, but of the money I lost, IT IS LOST FOREVER !!!!
I NOW enclosed my reply for everyone to consider action. I had lodged a complaint to the Department of Fair Trading. I think we should report this to the Police too. What do people think?

&quot;Dear Jennifer
All I want is a refund as PayPal do owe me a duty of care. It is obvious that inspite of all you are saying, no refund would be made so I would now lodge a formal complaint with the Department of Fair Trading as well as advise people who log onto the blog to do the same. You will be hearing from the Department of Trading shortly.
It is disgraceful that in order to get a commission, PayPal has put all its clients at risk by dealing with people who set up scams. PayPal keep on telling people how safe it is but when something like this happened, your company do not provide a refund. As you already set a precedent by refunding some people, my legal adviser has advised that I have 
a very strong case once my complaint is lodged with the Department of Fair Trading.

		<description><![CDATA[I think Paypal are taking the money from Gamesingate site bacause they did the same to me I got my $750 back from paypal. I insisted on talking to a supervisor and told them i wanted my maney back from the games in gate site seeing the otherone scarpered and guess what I got it. Paypal know that this is the same person I think with all the complaint they are taking the money from them. Mind you this wont last long as soon as the guy catches on to what is happening he will close his paypal account. So I suggest get in quick and see if you  can get any money back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On August 5th I used PayPal to pay for a Wii and other accessories from gamesinwelt for a total of $337.oo. 
After sending several emails to their &quot;customer service&quot; (obviously with no response) I started a google search and found this site. 
Immediately went to the resolution center on my PayPal account and filed a claim (Aug 14th) at which time received an email explaining that I needed to wait 10 days for the seller to answer... I knew what was going to happen but decided to wait... well... I called customer service to report the new scam under gamesingate.com but didn&#039;t push for a resolution on my case at that time.
On August 24 I received another email indicating that PayPal ruled on my favor but since there were no funds available on the seller&#039;s account they could not refund my money.
Full of rage wrote back to PayPal and pretty much told them they SUCK!!... I also reminded them about gamesingate and how they were the same people who stole my money in the first place.
To my surprise I received a new email yesterday from PayPal indicating that they had issued a refund for $337... THE FULL AMOUNT!!!
Not sure if it was a result of my &quot;follow-up&quot; email or some kind of misscomunication but I got my money back.
I suggest you all push for a refund; chances are you&#039;ll have to make a few calls and send a couple of emails to PayPal&#039;s customer service but you can get your money (eventually)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t rely on paypal with this one.  I put in a dispute and I won but they did not retrieve any money even though they found in my favour.  So much for protecting us!  I am out of pocket 240 dollars.  Very pissed off.  Have now filed a complaint with my bank.  I am more annoyed that paypal does not protect people from these fraudulent companies.]]></description>
