		<description><![CDATA[Hi! From the first time I tasted natto I loved it; which highly amused the owners of the Japanese market where I tried it in a sushi roll. Americans weren&#039;t supposed to like it. I bought it there for years and then they went out of business. I haven&#039;t been able to find it anywhere in New York...in fact when I ask for it in local Asian and Korean markets they don&#039;t even know what it is. Do you have any addresses in the USA where I can order it? Thanks! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thanks, Oslo, that&#039;s good to know. I was surprised to see that natto in Cambridge was a lot cheaper than natto in Berkeley, even though Cambridge is further from Japan. There is someone making natto near Berkeley whom I will soon interview on my blog.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m crazy for natto.  As far as I understand it, in the US, all natto imported from Japan is frozen, in those little individual boxes.  I never bought it because ecologically it&#039;s so lousy, so it always made sense to eat locally available/easily makeable fermented foods- sauerkraut, kombucha, kefir.  Natto is tricky to make at home.  Then lo and behold the receptionist at my dentist&#039;s office told me there is an outfit in western MA who makes it (and miso) and ships mail order.  It&#039;s the only domestic source I know of.  Kendall Foods.  Only answers the phone on Mondays (brilliant!) : 413 238 5928.]]></description>
