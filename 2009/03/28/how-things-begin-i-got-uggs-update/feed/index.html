		<description><![CDATA[If you are looking to get out of the UC system and/or are looking for a new school to teach at, this may sound odd, but the junior college up here in Santa Rosa might be a pretty good option. It is recognized as one of the top ten junior colleges in the country and pay is allegedly competitive to what youâ€™d see elsewhere in the state. Iâ€™ve known more than one instructor who preferred teaching there over anywhere in the UC or state system. Many of the professors are UC transfers and teach classes that are on par or more difficult than what youâ€™d see at that level. From my experience, many of the classes I took there were actually better than what I took at UC Davis.

Itâ€™s a good gig if youâ€™re just looking to teach a few classes part time.]]></description>
