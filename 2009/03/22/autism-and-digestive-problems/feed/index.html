		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Raw&quot; is also not inconsistent with fermented or bacteria laden food.  See e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aajonus_Vonderplanitz  -- a major supporter of the hygiene hypothesis, and whose books include recipes for fermenting raw meat in your refrigerator...  as well as many more tasty raw recipes, including many that use unrefrigerated eggs.  I eat most of my meats raw (although not fermented) and I don&#039;t refrigerate my eggs.  (But I don&#039;t just get them from the grocery store, either.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, but when someone like Pollan talks about processed food, he means some &quot;process&quot; that was invented in the last 50-75 years that usually involves splitting corn into its component parts and turning it into something that will fool your body into thinking its good for you.
