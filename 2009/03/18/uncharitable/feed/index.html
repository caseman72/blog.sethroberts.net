		<description><![CDATA[There are a lot of interesting people out there whose views about Aid I don&#039;t quite grok yet.  Surely I don&#039;t understand non-profits too, but I know I have some pretty strong views about reform for a certain number of them.  What is not clear from this post or the first couple on uncharitable.net is the numbers.  

If Pallot&#039;s company raised $140M in one year, and Avon raised $40 x 4, then a) is this a worse outcome (I suspect this is an easy yes) and b) how much did Avon get from Pallot&#039;s company?  My worry is for the deadweight loss of the marketing company (absent any other abstract benefit like publicizing an issue) subtracts from other charities.  I&#039;m sure this is a typical concern addressed in the book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Without any constraints Walmart would probably register itself as charity as a way to pay less taxes.
You need to write a law in a way to prevent companies like Walmart to register themselves as charity to get the benefits that charities get without providing the good.

If an charity doesn&#039;t want to operate under the rules for charities it can register as LLC. 
Now the law makers think that not every organization has to be a LLC and gives organization that don&#039;t want to make profits some benefits while structuring the system in a way that the average LLC doesn&#039;t get those benefits.

Organizations like Walmart pay lawyers to find every loophole in the rules that allow them to maximize the benefits that they get.

Do you want to create rules after which government officials decide on a case by case basis whether the company provides enough good to be a charity? Does Google provide enough good?
Maybe a charity provides good in a way that government officials don&#039;t understand? Maybe they practice political speech contrary to the governments interests?

Writing good laws is hard. How would you write the laws? Would you simply remove the distinction between LLC and nonprofit?]]></description>
