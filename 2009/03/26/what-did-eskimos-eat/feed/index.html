		<description><![CDATA[[...] Seth Roberts has proposed an interesting hypothesis, that humans like complex tastes (umami) because we evolved to like the taste of bacteria in food.Â  He believes that bacteriaÂ from naturalÂ pickling is harmless, and actually improves ourÂ immune function.Â  As reportedÂ inÂ Conditioning Research, Roberts points out that explorer Vihjalmur Stefansson reported that EskimosÂ ate lots ofÂ bacteria fermented fish, which he also grew to enjoy.Â  Supporting this theory, Conditioning Research alsoÂ tells ofÂ University of Michigan paleontologist, Dan Fisher, who butchered a draft horse and cached the meat in a stock pond. Â The lactobacilli in the water pickled the meat, whichÂ it emitted a slightly sour odorÂ that put off scavengers when it floated to the surface.Â  Fisher cut and ate the meat from February until midsummer to proveÂ its safety, showingÂ how hunter gatherers might have once stored their large animal kills.Â  As I blogged in an earlier post, fermented foods also are known to be good sources of vitamin K2.

		<description><![CDATA[Just to let you know:

Yes. The Japanese do eat fermented (rotten) fish. It was in fact the original form of Sushi if I remember correctly.  Fish would be stored with fermented rice for a long time, then eaten. The rice was discarded and not eaten. It is is still a delicacy I beleive.

I also think that in some parts of Malaysia or Thailand they eat fermented fish. Obviously there will be a lot of similarities of diet and crossover from culture to culture in that area. 

Thinking about it.... Im sure in Korea they eat some fermented fish as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fermented fish is also a delicacy in Iceland, as in Sweden. I&#039;ve read that it&#039;s   also a delicacy in the South Pacific, though I don&#039;t recall any specifics--perhaps Samoa? Don&#039;t know how widespread fermented fish is across Polynesian culture. The ancient Romans were very fond of something called garum, which was a sauce made from fermented fish guts. Perhaps any culture that eats a lot of seafood will also have fermented fish in its cuisine? Does anyone know if Japanese cuisine uses fermented fish? How about southeast Asia, leaving aside nam pla? Others? Perhaps isolated islands such as Shetlands, Falklands?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Patrick,

I noticed a big improvement in a number of dimensions of my health and well-being when I began making nutritional adjustments about a year ago, but especially 6-months ago when I began taking high-vitamin cod liver oil and butter oil. Seth blogged about it about a month ago. I haven&#039;t noticed any change since switching from the regular high-vitamin cod liver oil to the fermented kind, however. Perhaps I&#039;m already at a ceiling effect and I&#039;ve been taking a lot of fermented dairy (cheese, yogurt, kefir) daily.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We eat fermented herring here in Sweden. It&#039;s called surstrÃ¶mming and when my housemates ate it, we had to be very careful to open it outside and dispose of any waste quickly because if we left bones overnight the smell would take days to get rid of. Doesn&#039;t taste as bad as it smells though...but it&#039;s not exactly a regular part of my diet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought about getting the Green Pastures butter oil for my Vitamin K, but I couldn&#039;t shake the suspicion that I would be buying a bottle of exorbitantly-overpriced ghee.  If that&#039;s all it is (and I can&#039;t imagine why they wouldn&#039;t say so, if it&#039;s not), I&#039;d rather just get Anchor Butter from NZ and save the $.

(How can Green Pastures get away with selling that stuff without giving any indication of what&#039;s in it????)

Anyway, I went with Carlson&#039;s K-2 capsules.]]></description>

The closest thing surviving in the culture is &quot;aged&quot; beef...and we find it much better than the fresh variety.

I agree about the Nutrition Nobel, but fear it would go to Ancel Keys and the like.  Hell, they&#039;d give it to Suzanne Somers before Weston Price!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About a month ago I began taking 1/2 teaspoon of fermented cod liver oil each day along with my 1/2 teaspoon of butter oil (both from Green Pastures). At first it was a bit yucky and difficult to get down without a chaser (e.g., some strong coffee). But now I don&#039;t find the taste unpleasant, nor do I need to immediately cover up the taste in my mouth with a chaser. Actually, I sort of like it! It&#039;s a great way to get fat soluble vitamins A and D as well as some omega 3s (DHA and EPA). The butter oil provides some vitamin K2 as well, along with some CLA and other stuff that Weston Price wrote about. I think, by the way, that Weston Price should get the first Nobel Prize in nutrition. He was WAY ahead of his time, and still very underappreciated.]]></description>
