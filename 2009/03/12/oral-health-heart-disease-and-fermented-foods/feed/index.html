		<description><![CDATA[I saw a potentially relevant article on saliva and bacteria in CNN recently:

http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/03/03/saliva.spit.survey/index.html?iref=mpstoryview

A quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since people have different eating habits in different places, you might think an American&#039;s saliva might look a lot different from, say, a South African&#039;s. But a new study published in the journal Genome Research finds that bacteria in saliva may not be as related to environment and diet as you might think.

In fact, researchers found that the human salivary microbiome -- that is, the community of bacteria in saliva -- does not vary greatly between different geographic locations. That means your saliva is just as different from your neighbor&#039;s as someone&#039;s on the other side of the planet.

...

Americans in particular have a lot of amylase in their saliva because their diets are full of starch: chips, rice and baked potatoes. But the Pygmies of central Africa, for example, eat mostly game animals, honey and fruit. They have relatively little amylase in their saliva.

Dominy and colleagues found these differences at the genetic level, meaning natural selection has favored large quantities of amylase in populations with starchy diets.

But there is also evidence that amylase levels can rise and fall within an individual&#039;s lifetime. A study on college students in Ghana, who typically eat a lot of meat at the university, found that students who had grown up eating traditional starchy Ghanaian home-cooked meals had lower levels of amylase after attending the school.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, your comment about shifting diet patterns potentially obscuring the effects of a high sugar/refined carb diet reminds me of the basic ceteris parabus assumption in economics, which means &#039;all other things being equal&#039;, or which I define as a &#039;an impossibly fantastical state of affairs that can never exist in reality&#039;. 

Going back to the refined sugars/carbs story, I guess this is something that can and has been tested in experiments but in terms of public understanding the risk must surely be skewed toward a potential over emphasis of this factor in negative health outcomes and obesity, simply because of the potential for a spurious correlation.]]></description>

Wine and beer are both fermented, do they have any benefit or does the fact the fermentation kills the bacteria negate it?]]></description>
