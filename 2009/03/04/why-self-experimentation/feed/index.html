		<description><![CDATA[I was discussing self-experimentation with a colleague recently (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SÃ©bastien_Paquet) and he told me that he wrote his thesis by self-experimentation. (His Ph.D. was in Computer Science... though it was not very typical.)

His goal was to measure the impact that blogging has on a career and his research. On purpose, he became highly connected.  Of course, this is contrary to the scientific method: you can&#039;t be your own object of study. Yet, it worked well enough for him.

My own research (databases) is not a very good area for self-experimentation. However, for things like social networks, where researchers are currently struggling due to the lack of a convenient methodology, it could be that self-experimentation could help a   lot.]]></description>
