		<description><![CDATA[Some clothing stores (maybe just department stores) organise their clothes by brand.

I think London&#039;s peripheral surface train stations only have trains to the part of the country they&#039;re closest to. Rail is commodity though, but everyone I know has opinions on which airlines they prefer for better service.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Nobody brags about what airline they flew.&lt;/i&gt;

Whaaaat?

People do it all the time.  

I know people who say things like:

&quot;I never fly an American airline if I can help it.  I only fly X or Z.&quot;

Especially if they fly business or first-class.  A friend of mine was telling me how cool a recent Virgin flight was, and how it cost more than the identical Southwest flight, but was soooo worth it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are cases where this is done, such as at the commuter terminal at San Diego&#039;s airport, which is nothing but flights to Los Angeles, or the international terminals in some airports. Those make sense because of the different needs of those classes of fliers--international flights need customs areas, duty-free, etc. and commuters need different baggage handling and quick entry/exit. But in the general case, this makes little sense: unlike at a store where I&#039;m deciding between brands, virtually nobody makes a decision about which flight to take while standing at the gate. The three most common things you do are walk to the gate from which your flight leaves, walk from the gate to the outside, and walk between gates in order to transfer between flights. Since flight legs tend to be on the same airline, that makes a lot of sense. Also, there are a lot of potential destinations, and understanding how destinations would map onto the topology of the airport wouldn&#039;t exactly be intuitive.]]></description>
