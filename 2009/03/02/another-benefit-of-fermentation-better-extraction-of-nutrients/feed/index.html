		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I am very interested in this fermented food thing and the theories behind it. One thing I wish you would address though is the relationship of botulism to fermented food. I know nothing about it other than what&#039;s written in the wikipedia page on fermented food: 

Alaska, despite its small population, has witnessed a steady increase of cases of botulism since 1985. It has more cases of botulism than anywhere else in the United States of America.[9] This is caused by the traditional Eskimo practice of allowing animal products such as whole fish, fish heads, walrus, sea lion and whale flippers, beaver tails, seal oil, birds, etc., to ferment for an extended period of time before being consumed. The risk is exacerbated when a plastic container is used for this purpose instead of the old-fashioned method, a grass-lined hole, as the botulinum bacteria thrive in the anaerobic conditions created by the plastic.]]></description>
