		<description><![CDATA[i just did a quick search and it says that it basically suppresses appetite. it&#039;s not even really a diet.

i don&#039;t like any diets that make you not eat when your body needs you to eat...but hey, you can try it. it says that you&#039;ll find out in a day or two if it works for you.

if you want to stop eating so much, then just eat healthier, leaner/cleaner. if you eat less of the simple carbs, then your body won&#039;t have so many sugar highs/lows and you won&#039;t crave food to get that sugar high again.]]></description>
