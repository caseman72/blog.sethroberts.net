		<description><![CDATA[Man, I LOVE Father&#039;s Office for both the burgers and the brew! Unami and fermented beverage at the same joint! I just wish they were open for lunch more days a week (currently only Friday and Saturday I think).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you haven&#039;t already, get a Father&#039;s Office burger (Santa Monica and Culver City).  Very high in umami cuz they use dry-aged beef.

That burger will change your life.  

BTW that is the original burger copied by wannabe gastro-pubs all over Southern California and beyond.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE burgers. And this place isn&#039;t too far from my home, probably a 15-20 min drive. I&#039;ll definitely try it in the near future. Seth, if you are going to be in LA in the near future let me know and we can venture there together. It seems like a good place to celebrate our paper going into press.]]></description>
