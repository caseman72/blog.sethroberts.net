		<description><![CDATA[As an American who&#039;s lived in China for about 2.5 years, I agree with Prof. Roberts that this kind of thing is common in China. In my more cynical moments (I try to keep those to a minimum) it seems like many people are only interested in &quot;friendship&quot; with me so they can ask me for a favor, something they often do quite soon after initiating the &quot;friendship&quot;. I also would be fine with a straight-up proposal for an exchange, but that is often not how it goes. Even a request after some kind of hospitality would be OK ,though this may also seem a bit weird to me, depending on the details.  It seems like I just don&#039;t have the background assumptions about how reciprocity works that the Chinese do.

I think Prof. Roberts is also right that it has to do with poverty. In poor societies, highly local cooperation is a major source of social and material resources, and these norms become internalized. People from developed countries are more willing to make less binding social relationships, because the marginal benefit of an additional relationship is much smaller. The fact that you see the same norms in Taiwan suggests to me that norms like this are sticky; they outlast the economic conditions that gave rise to them (just an armchair hypothesis, for what it&#039;s worth). 

I should mention that I have several very good Chinese friends, whom I&#039;m happy to help anytime.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, as a Chinese, I have to admit I didn&#039;t figure out what was going on.
I also run into such awkward communications now and then. oops.

I suppose sometimes people just feel an invisible psychological compulsion to show hospitality. Not exactly because they want to be friendly or they are really that happy to having friends around, it&#039;s just according to such psychological compulsion (maybe cultural as well), having friends &amp; showing hospitality indicate a positive reputation and good social status.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, now I understand what you mean, but I still don&#039;t know why can&#039;t she welcome your coming without any condition, and give you a nice reception to establish a tie of friendship, after that, talk about the article (or ask you to be a co-writer). You would not refuse a hospitable host, right? 
Frankly speaking, we Chinese are very cunning, it&#039;s hard to see any genuine reciprocity or dedication, as well as any awkward bargain. Chinese are good at packing the nakedly exchanges into kindness and friendship. So I just wonder why she has to be so honest to make it as a condition before you go...I felt a little sick to go on.
The norms of reciprocity, love, thanksgiving, selfless, devotion, service...are the mental terms correlated to the cultural background, especially religious background. And the gentle side of human society is what social scientists pursue, without that, the richer people get, the poorer society is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason why they didn&#039;t mention the english paper help at the beginning may be that their request is known to all, and they didn&#039;t want others know the paper modifying request.
And I felt the assistant&#039;s letter was with  impoliteness, his/her request sounds like a command, this goes against the basic culture core of the chinese-modest and politeness. So when i firstly read your emails,  I felt something wrong with the assistant, maybe it was just his/her english problem(both paper and letter)...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wong China, I don&#039;t think she could just pay $200 to get her paper fixed. It is technical psychology material, someone not a professor of psychology would probably make a bunch of mistakes. I&#039;m sure the assistant didn&#039;t misquote the professor; the request for English help, when it came, was very clear. I don&#039;t mind at all that they expected to get something back; the problem for me was that this wasn&#039;t made clear at the beginning. In the beginning all that was mentioned was &quot;research collaboration&quot; -- nothing about English help. Had they been more upfront about what they wanted, and the paper not needing too much work, I would have been happy to help them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a Chinese. This really happends in some places of China, but I do not think this could be attributed to just  &quot;cultural differences&quot;. 

I have a theory, so called &quot;reciprocity&quot; is related to high population desity, especially high immigrant population, without a stable common culture.

In fact, in Chinese, so called &quot;reciprocity&quot; is called &quot;å¸‚ä¾©&quot; (Shi Kuai), with a derogative tincture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I think this kind of reciprocity is very common among Chinese universities, if Univ.A invite the professors of Univ.B for a conference, when the professors of Univ.B have some programs or conferences, they are expected to invite Univ.A. Because the program or conference is not considered as a matter of acdemic exchange, rather than a opportunity to share the money.
You case is quite reasonable in our logic: first, for the university, all the Chinese universities need to strength their overseas relationships to &quot;built the world first-class university&quot;, and strong relationships will bring the money - the national program to the university. 
Second, for the department. The professor use the money of department to invite you, and the accommodation especially the airplane tickets are expensive according to the exchange rate. So the department would like to ask something back, even just a good willing or wishes. I guess the professors want you and Mike to express the intent to widen the cooperation, including to invite them to the U.S. This mutual-beneficial intent is more important than what you actually do - it&#039;s OK if you promised but do not carry out due to some reason. That&#039;s why Mike was asked to say YES in Taiwan, I think what they need is just a good willing to cooperation.
Last, for the professor, though the paper on a international journal will benefit her a lot, It makes no sense to ask you directly as a return. You know there are many paper companies where she won&#039;t spent alot (about US $200) to get her paper modified. Why she prefered to ask a professor to do so? Perhaps, the assistant lose the focus of the professor, maybe the professor just said &quot;ask for mutul-benefical cooperation, such as a course to the students, even a paper modification&quot;. 
Though I have no confidence in the morality of my fellow Chinese, I believe the international cooperation is what they want, and an English paper is just a piece of cake.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;I was a little baffled that in this case a false commitment was the correct response, rather than a polite, honest refusal. There are two things going on here, I think. One is that I owed them some kind of favor after their hospitality. The other is that Asian emphasis on â€œsaving faceâ€, where being polite is much more important than being honest. (Thereâ€™s some of that in American culture, but usually we limit it to insincere compliments.)&lt;/i&gt;

By that measure, Los Angeles is part of Taiwan.  The correct response to a social invitation you know you won&#039;t accept is, &quot;That sounds GREAT!  I can&#039;t WAIT!  I am totally gonna try to make it!&quot;

Great shoes, by the way.  Where&#039;d you find them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trying to think of an easy-to-summarize example...  While in Taiwan, I was invited to the home of the parents of an engineer I was working with.  His dad, Mr. Lee, was a fairly affluent businessman, I don&#039;t know what business he was in.  

I was treated to a very nice, big dinner.  There were a couple other guests who also worked with us, but I was the only American, and clearly the &quot;guest of honor&quot;.  I didn&#039;t speak much Mandarin, and the Lees knew little English, so we mainly talked through my colleague R.L., acting as an interpreter.

Anyway, as I was leaving at the end of the evening, thanking my hosts, Mr. Lee asked when I was going back to the States. 

me:  Next Saturday.
Mr. Lee:  Come here on Friday and we can discuss some things.
me:  I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;ll be up in Taipei all next week.
R.L. (quietly but urgently): Say yes!
me:  But I can&#039;t...
R.L.:  Just say yes!
me (to Mr. Lee):  Sure, next Friday.
Mr. Lee (smiling):  Good!

The conversation with R.L. afterwards...

me: What does he want to talk to me about?
R.L.:  I don&#039;t know, but you had to say yes.
me:  But I have no intention of going there.  You know I&#039;ll be in Taipei.  Is he expecting me to show up?
R.L.:  Maybe, maybe not.  But it was very rude to say you wouldn&#039;t.

Needless to say, I didn&#039;t go back to the Lee&#039;s, and I never found out what he wanted from me.  It seemed to be more than just an invitation for another social visit, there was something specific on his mind.  

I was a little baffled that in this case a false commitment was the correct response, rather than a polite, honest refusal.  There are two things going on here, I think.  One is that I owed them some kind of favor after their hospitality.  The other is that Asian emphasis on &quot;saving face&quot;, where being polite is much more important than being honest.  (There&#039;s some of that in American culture, but usually we limit it to insincere compliments.)]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trying to think of an easy-to-summarize example&#8230;  While in Taiwan, I was invited to the home of the parents of an engineer I was working with.  His dad, Mr. Lee, was a fairly affluent businessman, I don&#8217;t know what business he was in.  </p>
<p>I was treated to a very nice, big dinner.  There were a couple other guests who also worked with us, but I was the only American, and clearly the &#8220;guest of honor&#8221;.  I didn&#8217;t speak much Mandarin, and the Lees knew little English, so we mainly talked through my colleague R.L., acting as an interpreter.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I was leaving at the end of the evening, thanking my hosts, Mr. Lee asked when I was going back to the States. </p>
<p>me:  Next Saturday.<br />
Mr. Lee:  Come here on Friday and we can discuss some things.<br />
me:  I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ll be up in Taipei all next week.<br />
R.L. (quietly but urgently): Say yes!<br />
me:  But I can&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
R.L.:  Just say yes!<br />
me (to Mr. Lee):  Sure, next Friday.<br />
Mr. Lee (smiling):  Good!</p>
<p>The conversation with R.L. afterwards&#8230;</p>
<p>me: What does he want to talk to me about?<br />
R.L.:  I don&#8217;t know, but you had to say yes.<br />
me:  But I have no intention of going there.  You know I&#8217;ll be in Taipei.  Is he expecting me to show up?<br />
R.L.:  Maybe, maybe not.  But it was very rude to say you wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I had similar frustrating experiences when I was working in Taiwan for a month in the 90&#039;s.  There was a strange quid pro quo dance going on all the time, and I felt like I didn&#039;t understand the rules at all.  My Taiwanese friends were appalled at times by my obtuseness - what was so obvious and natural to them felt awkward to me.

Since Taiwan is pretty wealthy (compared to the mainland), I&#039;m more inclined to attribute the experience to cultural differences, not affluence.]]></description>
