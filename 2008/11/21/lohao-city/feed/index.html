		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if it says something deep about China that such a chain has to have its own farm.  Maybe the customers wouldn&#039;t trust third parties to deliver actually organically-grown produce to the store.  They might shop there anyway, and hope, but wouldn&#039;t pay more because they wouldn&#039;t have any confidence that they (and the store) weren&#039;t being cheated.  Or, maybe, nobody will pay extra for organic, but the store can only keep cost parity with other stores by cutting out the middleman.]]></description>

&quot;Let the Guy Smoke: Obama Is Probably Fibbing About Giving Up Cigarettes. That&#039;s Okay.&quot;

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/19/AR2008111903531.html

The Chicago Tribune and some other papers also chimed in the next day with analyses of his conflicting and vague statements.

Like Laura Bush and Al Gore, he must be pretty good at avoiding being photographed doing it.]]></description>
