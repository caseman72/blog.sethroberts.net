		<description><![CDATA[China is changing quickly. 
When I was in Shanghai (where the traditional cooking is full of fat and sugar, yum!), a lot of the kids were overweight - and directly after school they would go to their local convenience store and buy more sweets and fat. 
Furthermore, in China, being fat has historically been seen as a status symbol (you only get fat when you don&#039;t do manual labor and sit around munching food all day because you can afford it). Historically, because there were only a few rich people compared to the total population who were near starvation levels, the chinese were considered a nation of &quot;thin people&quot;.
Another reason for the fat increase seems to me to be that, because the grandparents are often the ones to take care of the children, and they starved most of their lives (remember the famines under Mao?), they could be making up for their past starvation by feeding their grandchildren too much. Children are considered &#039;little emperors&#039; and are given as much food as they can hold.
Here&#039;s an interesting article on the subject of obesity in china: http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7564/362]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good point, Gordon. Let me add that in the Tsinghua cafeterias everything is made from scratch, including noodles. Just as everything was made from scratch in the much-less-diverse American diet back in the 1950s, before the obesity epidemic. 

I&#039;ve had some ice cream here but I don&#039;t know where it came from. It was vanilla with a lot stronger flavor than American vanilla ice creams. Tsinghua students drink some milk and yogurt.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true that the Chinese diet has an amazing amount of variety. It stretches belief, however, to think that everybody exploits this variety instead of routinely choosing favourite items on a daily basis. Furthermore, it&#039;s my personal observation that other Asians with less varied diets are also almost universally thin -- so long as they remain in Asia.

Aside from processed sugar and flour, the other thing conspicuously missing from Asian diets is dairy (Indian cuisine does have some exceptions). Have you tried the local ice cream?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few more variables about rice to consider (from a Japanese perspective):

1. Cooking rice isn&#039;t like popping bread into a toaster. Japanese rice cooker technology is amazing. But you&#039;ve got to scoop the rice out of the bag, rinse it (a long-ingrained habit), and wait for it to cook. And then wash the cooker before using it again.

2. As a side-dish, white rice is not flavored. Try chowing down on mashed potatoes with no salt, pepper, butter, milk. Or bread made without salt.

3. Because of government price-support policies, white rice in Japan is expensive. Price signals work not only in terms of demand, but can affect a food&#039;s social status, and its &quot;culture of consumption.&quot;

4. You eat the whole rice grain--that when cooked expands considerably in volume--not a ground flour made from the rice. The rice grain itself has a unique &quot;mouth feel.&quot;

5. There&#039;s no equivalent of gluten intolerance with rice. I suspect that the human body reacts much differently to refined rice carbohydrates than to refined wheat carbohydrates and sugars.

6. Chopsticks. Seriously.]]></description>
