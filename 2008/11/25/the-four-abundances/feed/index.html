		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

I think you used the word &#039;free&#039; a bit inaccurately, I think you mean inexpensive or cheap, which is not quite the same as free.  :)  

&lt;i&gt;You donâ€™t agree that water is abundant at least some places and that this is amazing?&lt;/i&gt;

Something interesting to think about.  Why is water relatively cheap to, say, diamonds?  Sure, water is more abundant than diamonds, but we certainly cannot live without water, while the reverse is not true, no?

Here is why:  The marginal utility of water declines faster than that of diamonds.  The second/third/nth diamond is just a little less valuable than its predecessor, while second/third/nth unit of water&#039;s value declines faster.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy and Patrik, &quot;free&quot; has multiple meanings. One is the price you immediately pay for something. By &quot;everywhere&quot; I meant in an average American&#039;s life.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

I think you are missing basic point.  Almost nothing is free. You write:

&lt;i&gt;Water. Free and everywhere. So cheap my Berkeley landlady pays my water bill. This has been true for a long time.&lt;/i&gt;  

Well, it is not free since your landlady pays the bill, and you pay the landlady your rent, you are in essence paying for your water bill.  Yes, she sends off a check to the utility company every month, but only b/c she knows your check is coming to her.

Also, Lomborg, founder of the Copenhagen Consensus would disagree with your assertion that water is free, cheap and everywhere.

http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=1150

&lt;i&gt;1.1 billion people lack good, clean water supplies, and 2.7 billion have no access to proper sanitation. Sophisticated modern piped water networks are far too expensive for most developing countries, but there are a number of low cost local interventions which are very cost effective and can increase the quality of people&#039;s lives significantly.&lt;/i&gt;

Not only is water not free, there are a host of things you mention that are costly, but appear free or low-cost to you. 

&lt;i&gt;For longer trips I take the subway (30 cents/ride) or a cab (a few dollars a ride).  Many people take the bus (a few cents/ride). &lt;/i&gt;

We don&#039;t know the marginal cost of that subway ride, but I surmise that you are bearing all of it.  I assume that like almost all public transportation, it is heavily subsidized by taxpayers.  Meaning, it is not as cheap as you see it being.]]></description>
