		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like about 350 women would have been taking flax, and about 40 premature births would have been seen from that group. Very striking. Could anything else have explained this? A different type of interaction or another aspect of lifestyle from the type of women who use supplements? What else was controlled for? It would be interesting to see this contrasted with other types of Omega-3 supplementation. I&#039;m assuming it is another constituent of the flax causing this -- maybe the lignans?

If that is the case, I would wonder whether the problems flax creates in pregnancy isn&#039;t having some smaller effect on general consumers, which is not noticed because the O3s are offsetting a still greater problem. 

Would be interesting to know quantities. Most people probably only take a few of the capsules a day, so if these women were taking such small quantities that is really alarming.]]></description>
