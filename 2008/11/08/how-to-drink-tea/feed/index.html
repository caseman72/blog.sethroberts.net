		<description><![CDATA[Speaking as a Chinese person, it was amazing to me when I first heard people put tea leaves in little bags and that they even came in different flavors. By the way, make sure you find out which brands are the best. You can probably even  start putting flowers or goji berries in your tea for the added health benefits. 
Best of luck!]]></description>
