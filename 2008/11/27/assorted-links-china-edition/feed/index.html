		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard of some of those sites. I personally use www.nciku.com because you can start your own account and build vocabulary lists, look up words by drawing them on a character recognition tool and they use more than one source for translating words from english to chinese and chinese to english to make the meaning and usage of chinese words a lot clearer than just looking up a definition in a standard dictionary.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Those are all good websites that you mentioned and I&#039;d like to mention two others.  The food review website dianping.com is a marvelous resource, although it&#039;s only in Chinese.  But it does list the highest rated restaurants and their most popular dishes, so you really only need a little chinese or machine translation to get alot out of it.  Also, alljapaneseallthetime.com is a great site with a different theory of language learning especially for east asian languages.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of years ago, I had business that brought me to Shanghai a few times. I don&#039;t like cities at all, and I don&#039;t like breathing air that I can actually see, but I fell in love with the place. Well, maybe not the place itself, but being there. Unlike Phoenix, in Shanghai, and in China in general, there is so much there, there. In Shanghai, you could feel the energy of Asia being sucked there as if Shanghai was the center of a giant cultural and economic whirlpool. There is nothing like it in the United States. It makes even NYC seem like an interesting, but rather slow-moving and self-involved little town.

I&#039;m not saying I&#039;d move there, but there is nothing like China on the planet now other than China, if there ever was. If you have not been there and experienced it, you cannot know what the world is really like, because China is more of the world than you can imagine if you haven&#039;t been there.]]></description>
