		<description><![CDATA[One PhD student I met at Berkeley said that she visited Tsinghua as well.  I asked her how she survived without knowing the language.  She said that her Chinese friends would write down things she wanted to say on an index card.  Then she would use that index card to help her communicate with others who couldn&#039;t speak English.  

Seth, I think it&#039;s great that someone said you are a good student. I bet you are a great professor, too!  When I was trying to learn languages, I would teach myself using books I got from Barnes and Noble, then practice the things I taught myself with other people, including students at Berkeley and my coworkers.  It was a great way to learn languages because if I misunderstood something, then others can correct it for me.  

I really like your blog because it is very uplifting and encouraging.  Your view of life is very unique!!!!]]></description>
