		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re still doing the kendama, let me know. I&#039;ll send you an official one, licensed by a nonprofit that certifies them. They have patents and design patents on the particular design used in competitions, and three companies currently make them.

Spinning the ball isn&#039;t necessary. You just need to jerk the ball straight up from a dead hang when it is still and not jiggling so that the hole stays on the bottom. Spinning accomplishes that by making the ball a little gyroscope, but you can just stop the wobbling with your hand also.

When catching the ball in the cup, you put the cup under the ball at its apex, but you should pull it straight up, not in an arc, although the arc version is also one of the tricks you can do. There are over 100 tricks.

There are kyu and dan levels, just like in karate. This page has the tricks for all the kyu levels of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kendama.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;kendama&lt;/a&gt;. Check out the &quot;lighthouse&quot; if you really want to see something that seems impossible (but is not so hard if you blow several hours practicing it).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You keep saying it&#039;s hard to do, but it isn&#039;t once you know the trick.

Both the cup-and-ball and the spike-and-ball have a trick that let anyone with a little eye-hand skills do it successfully.

cup-and-ball:

When you throw the ball in the air (by tugging on the cup) it forms an arc.  You want to catch the ball as it approaches the apex (top) of the arc.  If you catch it too far below the apex it bounces and won&#039;t stay in the cup.  Ideally, you get the cup right under it as it hits the apex.

spike-and-ball:

Take the ball and set it spinning at the end of the string.  Then do the same thing as with the cup-and-ball.  The spinning keeps the hole pointed downwards.  It&#039;s actually easier because you have more &quot;bounce&quot; room because the spike is so tall.

Ciao!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My morning routine includes:

1 - 20 minutes of a driving game, Burnout Revenge, an XBox video game, using a Kilowatt game controller (http://kotaku.com/gaming/live-blogging/kilowatt-kills-my-girly-muscles-110058.php)
This meets your criteria in spades - hard, fast paced, visual. Wakes me up physically, gets blood flowing to the brain.

2 - Mindhabits, http://mindhabits.com/ . The goal is to click on smiling faces. Hand-eye coordination...and a tie-in with your faces in the morning idea. It&#039;s shown to reduce cortisol (paper  - http://selfesteemgames.mcgill.ca/research/dandeneau_etal_07.pdf) Mindhabits meets your 3 criteria.. though I don&#039;t obsess over score. I do it because it&#039;s fun and improves my outlook.

3 - Typing practice: recently switched to the Dvorak keyboard layout so I practice 15 minutes a day. The software tracks speed and error rate.

All 3 are electronic games which record results. They&#039;re fun and get me &quot;warmed up&quot; for the day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Video games are very social, if mostly only between males.  You might imagine it&#039;s a way to establish a hierarchy like hunting is for the Ache, even though it&#039;s not necessary anymore.

Sounds like bibloquet would be useful if anything as party trick, like solving the Rubik&#039;s cube, playing the harmonica (these days), or other things kids routinely and amazingly master in their spare time.  

I don&#039;t see why you should want a particularly fun game, that would encourage you to want to improve personally.  You want something where it&#039;s very clear what your limitation is, and not personal technique.  Something that takes the data for you, so that you aren&#039;t able to bias the value, sure.  The few you list sound fine, if they reflect something.  Really, it seems like with most games/tests you&#039;re screwed, because of learning.  

Maybe it&#039;s best to have a game you&#039;ve reached a near permanent plateau with, so that transitory omega-3 status shows clearly against the residual learning background.]]></description>
