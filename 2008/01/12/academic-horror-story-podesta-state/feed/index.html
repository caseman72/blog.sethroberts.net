		<description><![CDATA[I did a little more research on that FIRE institute - I was alerted when I saw that Cato was involved (Cato being a libertarian right-wing think tank).

It appears that FIRE is, indeed, a right-wing hack group:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Individual_Rights_in_Education#FIRE.27s_political_orientation

They&#039;re using this case to try and up their street cred. It&#039;s why you won&#039;t find any mention of their funding sources on their website. It&#039;s a good cause - defending this kid - but it&#039;s shameful that FIRE is using the case in a cynical fashion. But would you expect anything else from a right-wing hack group?

They&#039;re part of that whole David &quot;I used to be a left-wing Marxist&quot; Horowitz&#039;s campaign to intimidate professors into teaching &#039;state capitalism for the rich&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t understand why it&#039;s being published just now. the article seems to let us know that Barnes did actually have a personal/private psychologist - was that knowledge the university was allowed to divulge?

it&#039;s obviously a trashing operation run by the President, Ronald Zaccari. I&#039;ll drop a call in there on Monday, for sure.

and it reminds me that I should do something to get myself and all alumni of my schools organized for when something like this happens. uh-oh - a new website - here it comes....]]></description>
