		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;I do think that Jane Brody is as responsible as anyone alive for the obesity epidemic. She just bought into this idea of the low-fat diet as a healthy diet, and her sources in New York told her that Atkins was a quack, and that fat was bad, and she never questioned any of it. I donâ€™t know if she had the intellectual wherewithal to do it.&lt;/b&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; I just watached Taubes on Charlie Rose. Dr. Ornish raised a good 
&gt; point - that Taubes is very good at poking holes in othersâ€™ research, 
&gt; but there hasnâ€™t been many studies to show that Atkins own diet 
&gt; is actually healthy.

Marge, I&#039;ll have to point out now that the charlie rose show with Barbara Howard, Gary Taubes, Dean Ornish was in 7/2002 - that is almost six years ago. At that time Gary Taubes hadn&#039;t even started the 5 years of full-time research for his book.

I also found the discussion and was a little disappointed because Gary didn&#039;t give the arguments that he so very clearly presented in his book until I realized that the video was from 2002 when Taube&#039;s &#039;Big Fat Lie&#039; article was published.

After 2002 there have been a lot of studies showing that the Atkins type of diet is in fact very heathy! Unfortunately there are no major long-term studies - the longest I heard of being 44 moths (a swedish study on diabetics on low carb). But there are dozens of studies that are 6 or 12 months long already. I&#039;m staggered by the amount of studies that come out nowadays - nearly every week there is a new low carb study published in some of the big nutritional / medical journals all of the results have been very good.

Luckily a lot of things have changed in the last 6 years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I hit return too early! 

As far as the interview here, I found the entries on Rubbia fascinating! I realized while reading the interview I had bought that book years ago and read it! I had forgotten the author&#039;s name.

The cold fusion portion is also fascinating - what a great opportunity to develop one&#039;s scientific intuition.

I would love to hear more about that BS detector, whether that was generalizable to other people, circumstances, and if it helped him in his daily life. 

In the spirit of Seth Roberts, the intriguing idea to me is that everyone has intuitions, but to be able to TEST the intuitions, and to verify or disconfirm them, is very exciting.

The idea of calibrating one&#039;s intuition is great.

I work with patients and they often fib or lie, and I often wish I could find out if my hunches are accurate, and to what extent. Taubes&#039; experience in this dept is an interesting lead...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just watached Taubes on Charlie Rose.  Dr. Ornish raised a good point - that Taubes is very good at poking holes in others&#039; research, but there hasn&#039;t been many studies to show that Atkins own diet is actually healthy.

On a side note, Taubes didn&#039;t really come off too well; he interrupted too much and Ornish&#039;s point (my point above about poking holes) rang true.   Taubes wasn&#039;t rude, but Ornish seemed too mild mannered and nerdy, and Taubes too impatient and testy, unwilling to let either of these actual researchers even finish a sentence. Unflattering.

Taubes is a bright man, no doubt - Harvard,etc. I also don&#039;t doubt his honesty or his zeal (certainly not the latter! I just read his response to Fumento at Reason!).

I would just offer unsolicited advice that his ideas are exciting and he is an articulate, forceful advocate - he can rest a little bit; the average reader/viewer will, however, constantly be thinking &quot;But he&#039;s not a doctor, let alone a researcher himself&quot;, unfortunately.  No journalist can match an actual researcher, no matter his or her zeal. A good narrative is still different than good science.

I am all for paradigm shifters and new Copernicuses. If Taubes helps Americans be healthier and provides an epistemological slap in the face of the AMA, hot dog, as long as the evidence is there. But it&#039;s so much fun to be sexy and an outsider, and no fun at all to be a scholarly drudge affirming the platitudes of dietary common sense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife recently lost 40 lbs. She is 40, and she has a bad hip, so she has extreme difficulty exercising, esp. cardio.

She is lactose intolerant, and she is a vegetarian. So, that leaves vegetables, and to top it off, she does not like sweets. Whew!

So she eats a hi carb diet.  She lost 40 lbs in a year, has kept it off. 

I am very proud of her, and her doctor&#039;s visits have shown her health and tests to be very good. So I guess she&#039;s a case where  she is the opposite of an Atkins type diet.

I, for one, expected her to fail, but of course did not say this! Her case is very atypical, I would imagine. She is very disciplined.]]></description>
