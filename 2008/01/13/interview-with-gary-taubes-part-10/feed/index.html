		<description><![CDATA[â€œâ€¦the correct interpretation is that we overeat because we get fat, we donâ€™t get fat because we overeat.â€

Yes. The slightly longer version: When our insuling levels are high (either from eating a lot of carbs or from having metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia) all energy is directed to the fat tissue. All the energy (fatty acids and lipoproteins) get&#039;s sucked up in our fat tissue and our muscles and other organs are deprived of evergy which will make us hungry and causes us to eat again.

So the above sentence is literally true even if it doesn&#039;t seem to make sense at first.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, great interview.  I&#039;ve been enjoying it, and am looking forward to reading Taubes&#039; book.

(These are the typos that I noticed: 
&quot;is that we get overeat because we get fat,&quot;
&quot;who has written papers discusssing this causality issue and getting it write&quot;
&quot;But what they were getting wrong were subtle&quot;
&quot;like the only that matter is&quot; 

Please delete this portion of my comment, after you read it.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;but I have seen a skepticism re: the Ancel Keys/low-fat dogma beginning to percolate through the memes out there.

A work of this quality and range simply cannot be denied.&quot;

I hope so.  I&#039;m a hoper in the percolate theories ...

BTW, went to Washington over Christmas (State, not D.C.) started four people on SLD.  Now that I&#039;ve kept the weight off, they are interested.  Was an interesting visit.  I&#039;m really curious to hear how it goes for them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This interview continues to amaze me, Seth.  Fantastic.

And there is deafening silence on Taubes from the top obesity authorities -- a far cry from the howls of outrage that greeted his NY Times piece.  The book is just too authoritative.  I think they know he knows their field better than they do...so they&#039;re hiding in their foxholes, waiting for it to blow over.

The blogs know about the book, though, and Google ain&#039;t forgetting it any time soon.  It may be my imagination, but I have seen a skepticism re: the Ancel Keys/low-fat dogma beginning to percolate through the memes out there.

		<description><![CDATA[I do think science gets it right in the end, and that good science displaces non-science in the end. And I think Taubes&#039; book will accelerate this process re carbohydrate metabolism.

The book has been incredibly useful for me, and has started me down a number of good/interesting paths. Since lowering my blood sugar down another level, to try to keep it close to 83, I&#039;ve lost 10 more pounds and my arithmetic performance tests look better.]]></description>
