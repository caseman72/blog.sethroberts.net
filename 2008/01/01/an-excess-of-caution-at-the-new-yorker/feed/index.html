		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s underediting. Sad, cos line-editing is something the New Yorker used to do superbly. The writer obviously wants to add a tentative note to the blank statement &quot;Politicians value competence and probity less than devotion&quot;, so he throws in a quibble, in fact he throws in three, then qualifies one by writing &quot;Many, perhaps most&quot; instead of just &quot;Many&quot;. It makes him sound like a nervous Nellie. 

I&#039;d rewrite as follows, with one quibble only only:

&quot;Many, perhaps most, politicians value competence and probity less than devotion.&quot;

It&#039;s still not very good. &quot;Probity&quot; is a stuffed-shirt word - does he mean honesty? &quot;Devotion&quot; is also unclear - is it religiosity or loyalty?

Anyway, if the 1965-era New Yorker somehow reappears and is looking for a line-editor, let&#039;em know I&#039;m available.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the two version read very differently. is the second version a response to a query? is the second version a rhetorical question?

and the concept of competence vs. loyalty in politics is not very clear, i would argue - thus making the first version preferable on another count.

the first version just reads easier - and that has value. the seeming watery-ness of the first version would be a problem in many/most other cases (probably), but not here, methinks.  :)]]></description>
