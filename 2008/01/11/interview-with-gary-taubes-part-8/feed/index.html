		<description><![CDATA[Well, after 2 years on the Esselstyn diet, not counting calories at all, and eating as much as I want, I&#039;m still 50 pounds lighter than I was when I started, my exercise endurance is better than it was 20 years ago, and I&#039;m off all medecines.  Lipid panel for those who believe in these numbers are well below Esselstyn&#039;s target of sub 159 TC.  I have no idea if Taube&#039;s and the low carb crowd are on to anything, but I see no reason to question whether Esselstyn&#039;s diet works or not when it&#039;s been so easy to maintain results.  Really, if you doubt that this kind of weight loss is possible, just try it for a month and see what happens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Eric

I find .33 to .5 lbs of fat/day extremely hard to believe.  I suspect a not insignificant portion was initial water weight.

Regarding my diet, I do eat so-called &#039;whole foods&#039; as I have recently started eating hyperlipid* (majority of calories from fat, moderate amount from protein, little from carbs) and have had fantastic results.  My average weight loss per day was about .12 lbs per day.  My sleep has dramatically improved as well.  

*And no, I don&#039;t believe the lipid hypothesis ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_hypothesis ).

		<description><![CDATA[Varangy,  It&#039;s not far-fetched at all. I lost 50 lbs over 5 months following McDougall/Esselstyn&#039;s plans, with much of the loss coming in the first 3 months.  I&#039;ve kept it off for over a year and a half and have never counted a calorie.  If you take out extremely calorie dense foods (oils, meats, dairy) and substitute them with bulky less calorie dense foods, you will feel full on far fewer calories than ever before.  If you doubt it so much, why don&#039;t you just try it for a month and see?  Don&#039;t worry, eating lots of veggies and whole foods won&#039;t hurt you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whatever the diet, a loss of 4lbs of fat equates to a &#039;loss&#039; of approx 14000 calories. Much of initial  large scale loss has to be more than just fat loss(which is the only thing that people actually want to lose)  Losing even a pound of fat (3500 cal)  over the long term would seem a pretty demanding target.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, Varangy, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s outrageous at all. I experienced a similar rapid weight loss years ago, and it was on a very low fat diet. At the time I was following a plan very similar to the low-fat diet outlined in &quot;Eat More, Weigh Less&quot; by Dr. Dean Ornish. 4 pounds a week for an extended period of time seems unlikely, but 4 or 5 pounds during the first week of a program is not unusual. Of course, much of that weight might be from water loss and from your bowels and not really body fat loss.]]></description>

1/2 pound a day?  No f------- way!  (Apologies for the unintentional rhyme).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom and Dennis,

I imagine differences of opinion regarding what constitutes the &quot;proper&quot; approach to weight control could be resolved if more experts understood the importance of &quot;Biochemical Individuality.&quot; That&#039;s the title of a book by Roger J. Williams that was published more than 30 years ago. Mainstream science is only now beginning to appreciate the range of variation in human metabolic makeup as manefested in individualized responses to food intake.

Some people are really not all that sensitive to carbs. Others must strictly limit their intake to keep from gaining weight. There&#039;s some excellent discussion of this on pages 85-86 of &quot;Nutrition Against Disease,&quot; also authored by Dr. Williams. For example: &quot;Kuo and his coworkers found that the liver tissue of individuals with high blood fat levels took up fructose five times as rapidly as individuals whose blood-fat levels were lower. Fat tissue from individuals with high blood fat levels also took up fructose seven to eight times more rapidly than the fat tissues of individuals with low blood fat levels. This shows how biochemical individuality comes into the problem and gives us a lead as to how some individuals may be adversely affected by the fructose content of sucrose.&quot;
The notes at the back of the book contain further comment:  &quot;In their study of eight â€œhyperlipidemicâ€ patients, Kuo and colleagues found that dietary sugar (sucrose) administered to patients causes blood fats to increase, while starch tends to lower them. They found that individuals who had low blood fat levels were relatively resistant to the effects of sugar, and that 85 to 90 percent of the total calorie intake in sugar was required to produce hyperglyceridemia.&quot;

Notice the difference between metabolic response to starches and sugar. For some, just reducing sugar intake while consuming all the unrefined carbs they want will result in weight loss. So Dr. McDougall&#039;s approach does work for some but not for others. 

I suggest you guys read a December 10, 2007 article by Carmen Drahl published in CE&amp;N subtitled &quot;The maturing field of metabolomics is taking steps toward guiding personalized nutrition.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, you seem to be blind to the fact that every time I write something critical of Gary Taubes, you bring up me. Look at your first comment:&quot;Which you would know.

If
you
READ
THE
BOOK
! &quot;

Anyone who reads my blog or my comments here can see that I&#039;m a complete ignoramus who never reads anything.

In any case, I&#039;m responding to words on this page, not somewhere else, and I&#039;ve backed up my claims wherever I&#039;ve made them.

So, Tom, do us all a favor, and unless you&#039;ve got something substantive to say, that is something that isn&#039;t about me or my reading habits or my qualifications to comment on Gary Taubes&#039; bad science and misleading statements (like the one above)...

I notice that Taubes himself makes a number of insinuations about other peoples&#039; motivations, e.g. &quot;They just donâ€™t care. Thatâ€™s how dedicated they were to trying to squash Atkins. [...] All they wanted to do was establish that Atkins was not a credible source, and people shouldnâ€™t follow these bizarre practices of nutrition, or whatever they called it.&quot;]]></description>

You seem to be questioning my qualifications (when of course, the only thing that matters is whether one&#039;s statements are true  or plausible and whether they can be backed up).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In no way is it a personal attack; I&#8217;m merely turning the tables regarding your repeated query about my reading Taubes&#8217; book.  You seem to be questioning my qualifications (when of course, the only thing that matters is whether one&#8217;s statements are true  or plausible and whether they can be backed up). So, for the record, my background is in microbiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology, the last at the grad level. What&#8217;s yours?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also take your response to my question about reading in nutrition to be &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>

Since the medical and scientific communities seem hopeless regarding nutrition, why not try to sell your book to Oprah. I say this not only because she can make a book a bestseller, but especially because she has had an epic struggle with her weight all of her life. I would guess that it&#039;s those of us who&#039;ve struggled with food and have the most to gain from your insights, who are your biggest fans.

Since reading your book and everything else I can find related to it, I&#039;ve come across information linking insulin/blood sugar with eating disorders, mood disorders, alcoholism and addiction, night eating syndrome and more. I&#039;m not overweight but have struggled with food and various disorders all of my life and reading your book gave me the motivation to try something different. I&#039;d been fat-phobic and ate little protein or fat for years and I can only wonder what havoc that wreaked on me. 

Anyway, I&#039;m a huge fan of the book and hope that it breaks through the mental fog of the mainstream nutrition field. I understand that you don&#039;t want to spend time on a website but something simple just to alert people about new events/interviews would be great.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The idea that you could somehow lose weight by removing fat and increasing carbohydrates is as ludicrous as the idea that you could do it by eating ice cream for any extended period of time.&quot;

Overreaching, to put it mildly. People lose weight that way all the time. For example, at places like Dr. McDougall&#039;s clinic, which practices low fat/high carb in the extreme, with no limitations on intake, massive weight losses are common,  not to mention reducing or eliminating insulin and blood pressure medications.]]></description>
