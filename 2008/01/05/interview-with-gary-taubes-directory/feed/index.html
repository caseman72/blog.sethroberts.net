Funniest moment: Roberts, a psychology professor whose idiosyncratic self-experimentation led him to believe that swallowing flavorless (or oddly flavored) but caloric food, like vegetable oil, can cause weight loss, trying to explain his theory: TAUBES: When you talk about flavorless protein, what do you mean? The oils, I understand; the fructose fits with everything I know. The sucrose starts getting tricky. What do you mean by flavorless protein? Give me an example. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there is a transcription error in this section of the interview.  

I think there are two separate incidences far down in the interview where insulin-resistant should really be insulin-sensitive.  I noted them below in these:  


&quot;TAUBES What I ask when I talk with these people. What I say is: Look at the regulation of fat tissue. The question is, how can you lose weight, or gain it --- how can you gain weight without either increasing insulin secretion, or increasing the relative insulin sensitivity of the fat tissue to the muscle tissue. Basically, the way we work, at least if you believe the biology that I describe, is that as we secrete insulin in response to the carbohydrates we consume and the insulin works, among other things, to facilitate the movement of glucose into the cells of your muscles and other lean tissues. But blood sugar is kind of toxic, so your muscle tissue doesnâ€™t want the insulin pushing all this blood sugar in, and it becomes insulin resistant. Your fat tissue now remains , because your body doesnâ€™t like to waste fuel. So if you eat a high-carb diet, your lean tissue  takes up some of the glucose for fuel, and the rest gets dumped in your fat tissue, and your fat tissue remains  for a long time --- far longer. Because once your fat tissue becomes insulin resistant, then you just become diabetic; you have no place to put the glucose. You just pee it out. Thatâ€™s the last resort, because your body doesnâ€™t want to waste fuel.&quot;]]></description>
