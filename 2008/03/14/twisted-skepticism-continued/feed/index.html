		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d add that trials in Europe determined that there were much better positions for childbirth than the standard one in America -- more than thirty years ago.

OBs, for the most part, stick with what is most convenient for them.  /Sigh]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a fundamental difference between the way individual people learn and the way public policies are determined. 

People learn only through self-experimentation, in which a healthy skepticism is necessary. But if there is too much rigidity in that skepticism, novelty is discarded as anecdote, rather than clue.

I think we can learn much from a scientific approach, but not necessarily by accepting the conclusions of scientific investigations as gospel, but rather seeing those conclusions as more data points. And the conventions of the scientific method do yield data points that have a unique, though not exclusive value.

I think nutritional data are particularly affected by the fact that we are much more biochemically unique than Nutritional Science posits and assumes. So generalizing investigations of nutrition to larger critiques of science in general is dicey.

I&#039;ve been involved in this kind of nutritional self-experimentation for decades, so I&#039;ve thought a lot about this. Coherence still escapes me, however.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting question. When I interviewed Taubes, he spoke of the importance of skepticism. But since his book was full of data I think by skepticism he meant &quot;value data&quot; (e.g., look at data) rather than &quot;ignore data&quot;. I&#039;m not sure, though.]]></description>
