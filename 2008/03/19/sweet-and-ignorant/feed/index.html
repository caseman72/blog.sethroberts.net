		<description><![CDATA[Based on SLD, I would expect a 0 cal drink to suppress appetite if taken within a two hour window, but to increase appetite if taken with food (though it should be better than a regular soft drink). Or is there a reason that flavor with no calories, wouldn&#039;t break the flavor-calorie connection as well as calories with no flavor? 

But then by the same logic, I would have expected the rats on the glucose sweetened yogurt to gain a little more weight than the other rats because they had the same flavor with a few more calories. Or perhaps the artificial sweet ends up not being &quot;invisible&quot; in the way sugar water sweet is?]]></description>
