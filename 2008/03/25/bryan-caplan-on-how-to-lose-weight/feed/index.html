		<description><![CDATA[to add a wrinkle to jon&#039;s calculation: That 80K is what he cut down from his REQUIREMENT, not consumption. If he was stable at 178 Lbs, they are the same. However,m if he was gaining weight when he met Seth, he had to cut down on the excess he was consuming, PLUS the 298 calories he had to cut down. Now assuming most people are gaining weight when they seek help, he needed to cut down on much more than the 10% you calculated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, from an overly simplistic mathematical standpoint, he lost 80,500 Calories worth of weight in say 270 days, or just under 298 a day.  Dropping one can of coke (160 Calories) a day (maybe even more, since he says he was drinking &quot;at least&quot; 2 per day) puts us at 138.  

Assuming that the meals he stopped eating when he wasn&#039;t hungry previously were about 1500 Calories (not sure if this is reasonable, I really don&#039;t have a good idea of how many Calories cooked food has), he could drop the remember of the weight by just eating 10% less, which seems very reasonable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be curious what else he was eating; eliminating the ditto food probably helped a lot. One thing is clear to me: it is impossible to lose weight if you eat when you are not hungry; so it is necessary to be aware of your hunger levels when you eat and not go beyond them...]]></description>
