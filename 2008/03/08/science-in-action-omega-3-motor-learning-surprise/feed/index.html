		<description><![CDATA[It seems flaxseed oil is becoming more and more popular.  I myself have not tried it however I have taken Omega 3 supplements, specifically the one from Neurovi.com, for a while because of the effects I&#039;ve read about it improving brain function.  I also took it when I was pregnant and had no problems at all.

One thing I do see in article after article is the importance of the DHA to EPA ratio when taking these supplements.  The one I&#039;m taking now seems to meet those standards ideally so I am happy.  Thanks for your very interesting article!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. The only important possibly negative side effect of flaxseed oil seems to be a lengthening of clotting times. Fish oil has the same effect. 

2. An average doctor would say that flaxseed oil &quot;interacts&quot; with medication designed to reduce clotting times. 

3. No other readily-available oils offer the same amount of short-chain omega-3. Fish oil has lots of long-chain omega-3.

4. The Spectrum Organic website has a way to locate stores that sell their stuff.  Barlean&#039;s is another widely available brand. Trader Joe&#039;s has an inferior version (with lignans, which are a useless complication).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,
Vastly enjoyed your presentation today and had a million questions. Three of them are:
(i) do you know anything about side effects of flaxseed oil?
(ii)interactions of flaxseed oil with other supplements? Other drugs?
(iii) which other oils offer the same amount of Omega-3? Grapeseed oil? fish oils?
(iv) you said that it was cheaper to buy in liquid form. Where (if there is no Whole Foods nearby)?

Best,
H]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read somewhere that the carbon chains in the fatty acids from flaxseed oil are too short and while the body does synthesize the longer chains the process is very inefficient, meaning that flaxseed oil must be taken in huge quantities. On the other hand, fish oil provides long chain fatty acids. I&#039;m veggie, so I&#039;m taking algal omega-3 oil from v-pure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth:

I am not sure I am reading your x-axis right, but isn&#039;t there a &quot;correlation&quot; between taking omega-3 + sleep and improvement ?

It reminds me of this entry in my blog:
http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2005/01/we-sleep-because-we-want-to-assimilate.html
which talks about experiments performed by Daniel Wolpert on sensorimotor learning that seem to parallel bayesian statistics (the last Paragraph). The sleep issue appears in small print in the nature paper (study done over two days)

http://www.hera.ucl.ac.uk/sml/publications/papers/KorWol04.pdf

But I think I read the more complete report which showed that learning after the first day was not optimal but was better when people had slept on it.

Btw, It is interesting that some of his experiments (http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/wolpert/projects/index.html) look like what you are talking about in your blog (about boredom and games...)

The Nature paper is:
http://www.hera.ucl.ac.uk/sml/publications/papers/KorWol04.pdf

		<description><![CDATA[Have you ever compared what type of omega-3&#039;s work best?  I mean, the whole ALA vs. DHA vs. EPA thing.  I&#039;ve heard that what people really need is DHA and EPA, and that not everybody can convert ALA to those other forms in their bodies.  Personally, my gums have been staying pretty healthy after I switched from taking an ounce of flaxseed oil to taking a few &quot;Fisol&quot; capsules that had about the same amount of DHA and EPA as the ounce of flaxseed oil.  And it&#039;s a lot easier to take the capsules.  I&#039;m curious, though, what findings you might have.]]></description>
