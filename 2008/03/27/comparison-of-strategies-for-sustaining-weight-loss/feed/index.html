		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The blog writer asserts that only minimal weight loss occurred.&quot; No, I wrote &quot;They did lose 19 pounds in six months.&quot; 

I would like to hear someone defend this study. I think $10 million should have bought a more sophisticated experimental design. Vic, do you disagree?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Considering the magnitude of the problem, only miniscule resources have been devoted to research on weight loss techniques.  Fast food companies spend billions every year promoting their products compared to a few million a year from NIH to study obesity.  
Do you think that long-term weight loss is important?  This was the first randomized trial to systematically compare behavioral weight loss maintenance strategies with more than one year of follow-up.
The blog writer asserts that only minimal weight loss occured, but that is not the case.  2/3 of the participants in the first six months of the trial lost 4kg or more.  That is enough weight loss to show improvements in blood pressure and glycemic control.  Similar amounts of weight loss in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) resulted in significant reduction in the risk of becoming diabetic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael,the stuff Seth complains about is pretty basic; I should think that there are lots of books that could have told the researchers and the funding agencies what the problem with their design was - if those people would have read them. In case I&#039;m wrong, Andrew Gelman would seem to be a natural choice for a co-author who knows lots about Bayesian ideas as well as Seth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of dogmatism, the recent flap over tobacco companies funding lung cancer research seems odd to me. In the New York Times, the editor of JAMA says flatly that she would never publish ANY lung cancer study if the author had accepted funding from a tobacco company. 

This prohibition is obviously irrational and seems more related to politics than to good science. Tobacco companies share with the public an interest in finding more effective treatments for lung cancer, if only to make their products less harmful to customers. 

No mention was made of any similar bar on authors accepting funding from pharmaceutical companies, despite their potential interest in study outcomes.

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed with Tom.  
Seth, maybe you should write a book on experimental methodology and design.  I hope you are somewhat familiar with Bayesian Statistics.  It would be pretty essential for such a task but you might be able to do it in collaboration with someone else who is familiar.]]></description>
