		<description><![CDATA[Performance gets better after period of stability. Isn&#039;t that a standard feature of learning, as the learnt stuff gets shuffled into neurons in a more permanent part of the brain (e.g., research on stroke victims who thought they reached limits of improvement possible with therapy, but found more improvements when therapy was kept up for longer periods).

Further practice makes performance worse. Well,  Tim Gallwey (Inner Tennis) kinda built a career on that, didn&#039;t he? Once you&#039;ve learned the basic task, focus from the wrong part of the brain can interfere with performance, eh?

Also, if you haven&#039;t already, you probably really need to control for aspirin use with these tests, due to aspirin&#039;s ability to combine with docosanoids to form potent, inflammation-terminating resolvins and protectins.

But I just learn this stuff from Oprah, so it might be wrong. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To add to my first post, it may reduce not only concentration, but also motivation.

To add to my second post, I think there may be threshold effects.

Both is nothing more than personal experience, but to illustrate, a few years ago, I got into playing a popular computer game (basically, a move-cursor-and-shoot game). Once I was pretty good at it, I lost interest.

The same happened with a pinball machine earlier. I broke the record on one and then couldn&#039;t be bothered anymore both about that particular machine and others of the same type.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

yes, but even with a constant repetition rate, couldn&#039;t the task get more boring?

If I see film XYZ once a week, it&#039;s going to get more boring (on average) every time I see it.]]></description>
