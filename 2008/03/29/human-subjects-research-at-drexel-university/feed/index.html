		<description><![CDATA[&quot;indemnification language&quot;

In many states you can give up your right to sue.  Indemnification language, however, is a contract by you to pay for their cost to defend against your lawsuit and to pay them for any damages they have to pay out as the result of your suit (or someone suing through you -- e.g. your health insurance company who would have a right of indemnification).  That is much stronger than a mere waiver.

Just FYI.

Too bad about the rat study being nixed.  Wonder what it would cost to have it funded by private donors?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

that &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; make sense. Reminds me of other stories I hear from the US - doctors performing useless medical tests just to be on the safe side, companies having their products come with hilarious warning labels (&quot;Remove child before folding stroller!&quot;) and the like.

It seems that American tort law needs some serious overhaul.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a very extreme example, and I can&#039;t even guess the reasoning behind points 2-4. But one hears these kinds of things about American IRBs all of the time.

I wonder: Why is it in a University&#039;s interest to sabotage its own researchers? It just doesn&#039;t make any sense at all. 

Anyone?]]></description>
