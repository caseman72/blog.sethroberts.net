		<description><![CDATA[Chris, that&#039;s an intriguing idea, using the red-green-blue values of a photo as a way of measuring redness. Your psoriasis data is very impressive. Have you reached any conclusions from it?

Tom, there is no medical school at Berkeley; UCSF is an hour away. I want to make daily measurements for months. That would be too much travel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been tracking the severity of my psoriasis using a cellphone camera. I take snapshots of left hand, open them in ImageReady (but any reasonable graphics program will do), take a colour sample of an affected area and copy the red-blue-green values into a spreadsheet. The most obvious variation is in the level of redness, which I expect has to do with underlying inflammation.

		<description><![CDATA[Yep.  I was just thinking that.  Dunno if you saw this post over at Art de Vany&#039;s blog on evolutionary fitness --- http://www.arthurdevany.com/?p=961

but the guy in the pictures, himself, references the inflammation in his face in the &#039;before&#039; photo.  Quite dramatic difference a year makes.    

Two questions:

1)  Is it really &#039;inflammation&#039; not just excess body, in this case, facial fat? 

2)  If it is inflammation, what is an objective definition, and moreover, what is an objective measurement?

Here Mark Sisson talks about inflammation and reducing it, without really defining it.  In the cholesterol post two comments above he had referred to biomarkers for inflammation without naming them.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Itâ€™s well known that â€œbadâ€ cholesterol is a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality in middle aged men.&lt;/i&gt;

@David Marcus

It may be &#039;well known&#039;, rather, many believe it as such --- but that certainly doesn&#039;t prove that &#039;bad&#039; cholesteol is any sort of predictor.  Taubes and many others such as Eades and Kendrick have done some serious damage to the validity of the lipid hypothesis and its attendant correlaries and ostensible implications.  
    
LDL levels may be a marker, but we really don&#039;t know for what.  We don&#039;t don&#039;t know if there is any optimal level of any sort of cholesterol.  Kendrick thinks it may be for stress.  See &lt;i&gt;The Cholesterol Con&lt;/i&gt; and his take on the lipid hypothesis.  

The low-fat and low-cholesterol myths-sum-informational cascades we have been drenched by prove absolutely nothing.  The more and more research I do, the more and more I think those who have promoted the aforementioned have gotten it wrong.  

What is &#039;The Unifying Answer&#039; to cholesterol and diet and health?  I dunno, but I think we are all better off admitting our ignorance than being swept away by these misinformational cascades....

BTW that is exactly why Taubes&#039; book is such a great one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These discrepancies and caveats underscore the need to look at LOTS of studies -- epidemiological, human experimental, lab animal experimental -- and in multiple categories -- old, middle, and young aged; various ethnicities and both genders; and with various risk and environmental factors -- in order to build a strong framework from which to derive testable hypotheses.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, there are many kinds of LDL, and the LDL level handed to you was almost certainly &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; measured (as that&#039;s expensive), but rather inferred from other results and then calculated (which is very inaccurate.)  So you really have no idea what your LDL is, and you certainly don&#039;t know your LDL particle size (which is crucial.)
