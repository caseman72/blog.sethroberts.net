		<description><![CDATA[Gotcha.  It would be interesting to see that tested with a more common athletic skill, such as free throws -- you any good at basketball??  Maybe it could help my squash game too.  If you want to test other cognitive functions the Nintendo &quot;How Old Is Your Brain&quot; game might be interesting -- it tests math and other skills and you might be able to see a performance effect there, though it isn&#039;t as quick as your current test.  Another simple one (though missing your game criteria of being fun, depending on your idea of fun) might just be speed and accuracy in solving a few tough randomly generated math questions in your head.  A performance effect there would be very interesting as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I take 4 T flax daily. Usually late in the evening -- 11 pm, for example. (This is not shown on the graphs.) These graphs show what happens when I take it earlier.

This is why the persisting effect reflects learning -- aftereffects of the combination of Event A (very high flaxseed blood level) and Event B (doing the cursor test) at the same time. Usually the very high flaxseed level happens while I am asleep. In other words, usually Events A and B happen far apart. The treatment is to bring them close together just once. A reasonably high level of omega-3 is nothing new because I take flaxseed oil every evening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious how your general consumption of flax influences these results -- I was under the impression you took flax more regularly.  I&#039;m also wondering whether the persistence of a good-performance effect reflects learning as opposed to enhanced cognitive functions that are directly related to some more persistent aspect of the flax.  Perhaps it is less a learning effect and more an efficient neurological function effect.  A graph that showed longer timelines and multiple dosages would be illustrative.

Interesting though -- thanks.]]></description>
