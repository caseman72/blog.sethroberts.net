		<description><![CDATA[Seth, Askimet decided I was a spammer for a bit, something on a group blog where I&#039;m one of the admins set it off.  Got that fixed, but it ate my comment on your game.

I used to program in machine code, a long time ago.  Now I&#039;m far away from doing that (since it was back in the early 70s and my last coding was in the late 70s).  I&#039;d like to try the game you invented, was wondering if I could have a copy to try, even if you&#039;ve decided it isn&#039;t difficult enough to be worth releasing.

Let me know.  Thanks.]]></description>
