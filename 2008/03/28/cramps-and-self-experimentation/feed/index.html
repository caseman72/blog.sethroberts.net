		<description><![CDATA[Any pregnant woman will confirm this is true.  With both of my pregnancies, I experienced horrible leg cramps/charlie horses once I hit the 3rd trimester.  By that point in the pregnancy, the body is pretty much at its limit and potassium is depleted quickly.  To remedy this, I ate a banana before bed every night.  On the nights I did that, no cramps.  The nights I skipped my banana(s), I woke up with horrible charlie horses and cramps.  Proof enough for me!]]></description>
