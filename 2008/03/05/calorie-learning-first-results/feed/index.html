		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve noticed what I suspect is the same effect with the flavored Wheat Thins.  When I eat Parmesan Basil or the Tomato Basil crackers for the first time after a long break, I don&#039;t care for the taste (though I don&#039;t find it horrible).  Usually I eat a few more anyway because they&#039;re convenient, and I find they seem to taste much better.  Before long, I have a hard time not eating them because they taste so good.  This experience has been consistent every time I&#039;ve eaten them (which isn&#039;t very often), and before reading about Calorie Learning, I didn&#039;t have a good theory for why it worked that way.  

One thing I wonder about is whether it would be possible to use this idea to develop tastes for foods that I feel like it would be worth liking.  I&#039;m thinking in particular of locally produced foods that would be good to eat for a variety of reasons, but I&#039;m not so thrilled with the taste.  Also, given that the Wheat Thin flavor seems to reset after some period of time, I wonder if it&#039;s even possible to make the Calorie Learning-based perception of good flavor permanent (by which I mean the perception that they taste good remains even if there is a significant gap between times of consumption or the fast calories disappear, but the flavored (s)low calorie food remains).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just in case nobody&#039;s pointed it out yet, I think that in this experiment there is a very, very big danger of reuslts being marred by the placebo effect. Yes, I know you&#039;re a bit of a skeptic in this respect. But you wouldn&#039;t dispute it exissts, would you?

That&#039;s not to say the experiment isn&#039;t interesting; it certainly is and I&#039;m going to follow it.]]></description>
