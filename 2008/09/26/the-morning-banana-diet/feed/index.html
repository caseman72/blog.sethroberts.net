		<description><![CDATA[This is my 3rd week on the banana diet and I&#039;ve lost 4 lbs. I took the &quot;eat whateveryou want at lunch and dinner&quot; very literally and still lost weight.  However, one of the rules is no chips, sweets, ice cream, etc., so I did not eat those for snack or meals.  But I did eat chile dogs, hamburgers, etc....things I kind of laid off just having finished 4 months on WW and only losing 10 of the 70 lbs I need to lose. I also have a slight underactive thyroid and get edema (water swelling) in my ankles that is very painful.  But, since eating the bananas (potassium, I suppose), that has gone away and I feel much better.  I eat 3 bananas.  Sometimes I get hungry between breakfast and dinner, but I saw a site that said to also eat a handful of nuts.  That would help and I think I will start trying that, but now that I have gotten the junkfood thing out of my system, it&#039;s back to whole grains, lean meats, and more veggies for me just because I feel better when eating that way.  If you want to know if it works, it has for me.  I suggest giving it two weeks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All i can say is that as crazy as this diet seems it really works, its all just common sense i guess, things you should be doing already, but most of us don&#039;t. Like going to bed at a decent hour, drinking, lunch and snack. Anyways, my quality of life has improved even if it is just a fad diet. Also, after 16 days i had lost 5lbs :) I blog about it if your interested at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been on the banana diet since November 1 and have lost 8 pounds (in 50 days). I have not done the diet perfectly but I have eaten a banana and water at least 45 of the days. I didn&#039;t do the diet around Thanksgiving (and gained 2 lbs or so that I had to re-lose). I&#039;ve also probably eaten more sweets than I should have (due to the holidays). 

The rules and how I do on them:

1. Eat a banana and lukewarm water (pretty faithful).
2. Eat whatever at lunch. I&#039;ve had something sweet after lunch probably 1/3 of the 50 days so far (so...I would say partly faithful).
3. Eat a snack at 3 PM (pretty faithful).
4. Eat whatever for dinner (sometimes have sweets; probably 10 days out of the 50--so, more faithful than not).
5. Eat before 8 PM (pretty faithful).
6. Go to bed by midnight (pretty faithful).

I guess if I didn&#039;t eat the sweets after lunch or dinner, I&#039;d be doing better. I also exercise on average of 4 days per week. I try to walk with some jogging 4-5 miles on some days; lift weights (1 set of about 12 exercises) some days.

Losing 8 lbs for me in less than 2 months is amazing as I&#039;ve gone on every diet imaginable with not great results. My pants are getting looser and my stomach is flatter. Most of my &quot;muffin top&quot; is gone (just a slight amount of spillover).

I&#039;m not sure how/if this will work the same for you as it seems to be working for me. I wish everyone luck with their fight against the bulge!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree the morning banana diet is not really suitable for westerners. Having tried it myself I found I was too hungry allot of the time and so I made some modifications to it which works better for the bigger western chap like me! I have still gone from someone that is clinically obese to normal weight within 18 months. I didn&#039;t think it would work either. Who&#039;d think it, eating a few bananas would do that lol  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For breakfast, you should eat one or more bananas and drink a glass of lukewarm water. You can have as many bananas as you like until you are full. The reason for the water to be lukewarm is not known and has come under much speculation on the Internet. Most diets suggest that you can burn more calories by drinking cold water.  Lunch can be just about anything you like. This diet places no restrictions on what you can or cannot eat. you can eat one snack around 3:00 pm if you are hungryDinner can be anything you like as long as you eat before 8:00 pm. Avoid ice cream and other dairy products, as well as dessert after dinnerOne other rule of the diet is that you must go to bed before midnight each and every night. This makes sense because studies have shown that a lack of sleep leads to obesity.  And finally, Yes I&#039;m definitely going to give it a try.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not sure if this has been covered, but a doctor once told my grandmother she was eating too many bananas (she had dementia and was not realizing how many she was eating during the day). She was getting too much potassium in her body. I forget what he said it does, but it wasn&#039;t good for her. Just like anything else: too much of anything is not good. For another example: Too much Vit C leads to diarrhea.
