		<description><![CDATA[Maybe adding a balance challenge to the one-bent-leg technique would make it more effective. Balance engages a whole host of additional supportive muscles, which may partially account for the original value of this technique (and why it hasn&#039;t been reported from more common leg exercises).

So perhaps try doing the bent-leg on some kind of wobble-board, being careful to ensure you&#039;re safe. Fitness centers sell variations of these devices, they are inexpensive, and balance is a great fitness element to work on anyway. Or a higher level challenge might be to try juggling. The cerebellum controls this type of coordination, and there is evidence of abnormalities in the cerebellum in dyslexia. Some researchers have claimed that very demanding physical challenges (hand-eye coordination at the same time as balancing, for instance) can ameliorate some symptoms of dyslexia, presumably by enhancing the function of this part of the brain.

Then add the one-armed handstand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You can also do one legged squats once your legs get strong enough.

A full range squat is going to work a lot of the muscles in your leg (vs. a partial).

You can start with just bodyweight squats, all the way down and up, you don&#039;t need to use weight, but eventually switch to single leg squats when you are strong enough.

That should get the time down to a much shorter time.  Even a hundred body weight squats can be done in a couple-three minutes, and that is a large number.]]></description>
