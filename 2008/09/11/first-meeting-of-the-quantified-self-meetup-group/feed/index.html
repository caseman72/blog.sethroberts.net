		<description><![CDATA[Justin, what I mean by &quot;standing on one leg to exhaustion&quot; has nothing to do with balance -- I usually touch something to make it easy to balance. I mean I stand on one leg until it becomes difficult due to muscles getting tired. I never actually endure pain or even discomfort but I go right up to the point where I would start to if I continued. In the beginning I could only do this for 2-3 minutes; now it&#039;s up to about 11 minutes. At the moment the &quot;whole regimen&quot; is what you call one set: standing on each leg to exhaustion once. In other words, left leg once, right leg once.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Your standing for better sleep comments are intriguing to me.  Could you comment on what exactly it means to stand on one leg to exhaustion?  Is this the point at which you can&#039;t maintain balance while standing on one foot?  Is the whole regiment to do two sets in a day whereby each set is stand-to-exhaustion on each leg?

Thanks for the intell-

		<description><![CDATA[Athletes and body builders are compulsive self-experimenters.  Unfortunately, as Sports Illustrated noted a while back, at the elite level, that also includes protocols and close to universal use of illegal drugs.

It used to be a few sports (weight class based sports) were immune.  I still remember my brother talking about how everyone at Nike was amazed by the wrestler who was on their endorsement list, was going to the Olympics and wasn&#039;t using steroids -- while it made sense to my brother, steroids would increase his weight.

Now, well, they have better steroids.  Not to mention, they&#039;ve discovered regimens that improve recovery time without increasing weight/muscle mass.

But it looks like you&#039;ve got a great group.  Next post on them, please do post the blog link in the post (for the lazy ones among us who don&#039;t want to work through looking in the side bar or on google ;) ).]]></description>
