&#039;Dr Susanne Sorensen, head of research at the Alzheimer&#039;s Society, said: &quot;Regular exercise is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of dementia and can help slow progression of the condition.

&#039;&quot;This study demonstrates that exercise improves cognition in people with mild cognitive impairment, and that there is a lasting effect even after the exercise intervention stops.

&#039;&quot;We need more research to investigate whether exercise not only improves cognition, but also stops people with mild cognitive impairment developing dementia.&quot;&#039;]]></description>
