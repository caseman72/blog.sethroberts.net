		<description><![CDATA[Adam, I don&#039;t bother to balance. I hold on to something. I believe what matters is stressing muscles so much that they send out a growth signal.

		<description><![CDATA[Seth (and others), I&#039;m wondering if you have tried closing your eyes while standing. Eyesight is important for balance, so in theory this would make it harder to balance, causing more rapid fatigue, and thus create an exercise more easily fit into hectic schedules. 1-3 minutes instead of 5-15 minutes.

I had posted before about having trouble getting fatigued after even 20 minutes. I tried your advice, Seth, and made sure my other foot was positioned far enough up on my leg. This did make a significant difference, simply by shifting the center of gravity and making it harder to balance. But, it still can take upwards of 10-20 minutes to feel any kind of fatigue, and I just haven&#039;t had enough time to get any kind of consistent data.

Balancing with the eyes closed increases the challenge, but I wonder if the effect remains undiminished.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was finding it impossible to do this correctly during the day due to the often frantic nature of my work.  I did manage it watching the early morning news and again in the evening.  Time to fatigue has increased considerably from less than 1 minute to about 8 minutes, with the effort to actually balance requiring more effort and causing earlier collapse.  I worried that just these two instances would not be effective.  Then, I gradually realized that the Zopiclone tablet I would reluctantly leave on the table in case I woke again after two hours sleep, and stay awake as I frequently do, was still there after 6 hours.  I haven&#039;t had 6 hours straight sleep for as long as I can remember. Thank you for this and for all that you have done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, the SleepTracker has a feature where you press a button when you go to bed and it automatically sets your &quot;to-bed&quot; time to be 30 minutes later. I don&#039;t know why it doesn&#039;t record for the 1st 30 minutes but it makes sense that it should not start recording until you&#039;re very likely to be asleep.

Baker, glad to hear it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want to add my name to the list of those getting the same amazing results, since I started the standing on each leg exercise I have been able to go back to sleep if I wake up in the night and feel like I have gotten good rest for the first time in 8 years.  Also to check I have intermittently (every couple of weeks or so) not done the exercises for a day or two and without an exception the nights I fail to do the exercise I sleep in only 2 or 3 hour spells, I am so happy to have been made aware of this and thanks for your efforts]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The SleepTracker is a neat idea, but I think wearing a watch to bed would make it harder for me to get to sleep. I&#039;m also surprised you have to set the &quot;to bed&quot; time to when you anticipate falling asleep. Should it be able to tell? The way I would want it to work is to push a button when I go to bed, then have it tell me how long it takes me to fall asleep as part of the data it collects.]]></description>
