		<description><![CDATA[A brief comment for Sam . . . the teachers in my Tai Chi group say that if the stances are getting easy, you need to sink lower.  They tell a story about one of the best students working on Descending Single Whip (also known as Snake Creeps Down) with our master teacher.  They were both at the lowest position and the teacher said, &#039;OK, like all one-legged stances, you should be able to pick your other foot off the floor.&#039;  Which he proceeded to demonstrate, while the student struggled.  Perhaps one of your fellow dancers has studied Tai Chi and can show you this stance.  It can also be found at 4:45 at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USJPmCZ6Efc.  And, by the way, while you&#039;re in stance, stay relaxed.  (One of our teachers taught a professional dance company; he said they were able to learn the stances and flow immediately, but could never relax.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Iâ€™ve found that if I just raise one foot slightly I can stand one-legged much longer (about twice as long) than if I stand one-legged and pull the other foot behind me (stretching my leg muscles).

Do you mean keeping both foot on the floor but raising one a bit so the load is put on the other one?. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On why one-leg standing works, here&#039;s one hypothesis to consider:
Standing on one leg creates asymmetrical loading forcing our body to engage more of the fine-control muscles and more neurons (firing) to maintain balance. Of course, these fine muscles tire out very easily - you can tell by the lactic acid burn which incidentally also signals the body to produce growth hormone.
This acute but brief stress will force your brain to enter deep sleep to absorb the lesson.
I think Tai Chi works for me (like Charles suggest) - probably because of the very slow and deliberate movements with absolute body control (&amp; concentration).
Can we test this hypothesis by standing on one leg with our eyes closed to intensify the experience? My limit on a good day is 20-40 seconds after some refinements to fine-tune the body posture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

In a similar vein, I don&#039;t know if you remember this study

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6795822/
http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/493323

http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2005/01/its-all-downhill-from-here.html

that seemed to show that walking downhill did not yield the same results as walking uphill.

Is there a mechanism that is specific to the soporific mode as opposed to the others ?

		<description><![CDATA[Great posts about your sleep and one-legged standing -- I will definitely give this a try in a while. In the interim, here is a post I got today from another blog I like about fitness: http://conditioningresearch.blogspot.com/2008/09/one-arm-pushup.html

It talks about one-armed push-ups, and one legged squats, which I mention because I have been looking into trying to improve my vertical leap to try and slam dunk a basketball -- some research demonstrated that doing one-legged squats helps improve power more than two-legged squats, and they theorise that it is because of incorporating balance. Maybe a series of one-legged squats while balancing would trigger your better-sleep-oscillator still more quickly? Perhaps it is load-dependent? As with your wondering if you&#039;ll get strong too quickly, you can ALWAYS challenge yourself with squats! Technique is important, you can often find good form on YouTube.

if you are interested in more fitness ideas, there is an interesting group called CrossFit, who believe in functional fitness, and they have an interesting paper on their website about their definition of fitness which incorporates balance and other elements. It is well thought out. I found these leads through my research into so-called evolutionary health, intermittent fasting, etc. 

Great posting!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tom, yeah, I don&#039;t think the leg muscles are constructed differently than other muscles; they&#039;re just larger. So that you get a larger dose of the crucial chemical per minute of exercise. I like your alternative suggestions because pretty soon my legs are going to be stronger than they need to be for any conceivable task and it might help to strengthen other parts of my body. It might take too long using other parts of the body but it&#039;s worth a try.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Soporific&quot; -- interesting.

I was about to suggest that it&#039;s really an offshoot of isometric exercise (as it seems to me that you&#039;re really tensing opposing muscles against each other.)  And this caused me to wonder if there isn&#039;t something in the nature of isometric exercise, rather than standing, that helps sleep.  ie, does it have to be standing?  Could it just be isometrically exercising, say, your chest muscles by pressing your palms together hard and holding it for a while?  Or holding a mid-pushup position (keeping your core solid) as long as you could?]]></description>
