		<description><![CDATA[so gravity affects taste/smell?  What strikes me is that space travel (the accompanying lack of gravity) could result in accelerated decrepitude, i.e., loss of taste, loss of bone are both hallmarks of getting older.  it makes one wonder what effect space travel would have on mental activities, i.e., could enuff space travel result in cognitive impairment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, 

Talking about nutrients, this reminded me another fact you might want to use to reinforce or refute some aspects of the Shangri-la diet (I realize that refuting is not your goal but it might bring a narrow aspect of it to light). In Space, one of the main issue for astronauts is the issue of taste. Most astronauts that have spent some time in orbit will tell you that the food is extremely dull. One of the goal of some of the chefs doing work for the space agencies (US, French or Russian) is to find a way of implementing spicy foods so that they raise the tasting experience. They have to do that and weigh this against the stringent requirements that the food must have a very low bacteriological activity.

At the same time, zero-g also brings a whole slew of annoying side effects such as space sickness (which is not the same as sea sickness and will bring down the best people for days -if they ever recover, some people have been known to be sick during their whole trip- ) and bone loss.   

Many astronauts will also probably tell you that their sleep pattern is not good and most of them do put that on the excitement of the trip. Eventually, it looks like I am noticing that most of what you are mentioning eventually has a strong relation to gravity (standing up for ten hours or one lieg) and taste (the shangri-la diet). Both of which disappear in Orbit.
