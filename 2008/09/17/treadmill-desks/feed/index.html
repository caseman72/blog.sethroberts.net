		<description><![CDATA[While working you can have a fitness workout using a treadmill desk, this is quite unusual but is worth a try. There are people who can think better if they are moving, and there are also people who simply can not concentrate while walking. A treadmill desk is designed to have a minimal workout even while working. It is very beneficial for people who are very busy and can not find time to go out for an exercise. It is true that sitting all day long will give you better fat deposits, you will be happy with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Treadmill desk may be fun at the start but as time progress you just simply want to do the treadmill first then do your work after or vice versa. Honestly can you enjoy doing treadmills while your fingers are tapping away those keyboard keys, not to mention how about using your mouse? 

In some form of exercise maybe you can combine work with exercise but honestly using a treadmill and doing your work, not to mention having those low cost treadmills that don&#039;t give proper stability while walking or jogging.]]></description>
