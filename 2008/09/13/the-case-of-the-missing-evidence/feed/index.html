Patients trust doctors. (When I asked my surgeon the basis for her judgment that I needed surgery &#8212; treating her as an equal, in other words &#8212; she must have been stunned. She certainly didn&#8217;t respond appropriately.) That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so easy for doctors to do too much or too little.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Thereâ€™s a subbranch of the field of folklore&quot; ... reminds me of the stories of mice in soft drink bottles ... and reading about how that was all folklore, except, of course, I had seen the citations and the actual case law involving those cases on appeal.

Or, in a case closer to home, the actual maggots in the package of crackers I went out and bought my wife when she was pregnant.

On a different example, which I will skip the details, you can imagine my surprise at having worked on a case and then having read about it being urban folklore.  Since the law suit involved someone suing over the facts being disclosed ... I rather believed the facts were acknowledged, not folklore.  Pleadings at the county courthouse.

Just a comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark,
Thanks for re-opening this discussion. If it did not involve a world-class thinker who states in his widely-read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.overcomingbias.com/welcome.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; that his significant interest is &quot;the rationality of paternalism and other kinds of disagreement&quot;, and who makes a living teaching medical economics, perhaps it would have no importance, and bear no further attention. However, a clear thinker like Seth Roberts has said that the incident was &quot;the most telling detail in Robin Hansonâ€™s lecture about doctors&quot;, the result being that he &quot;was very impressed by Robinâ€™s lecture&quot;. Consequently, I continue to feel that it should be fleshed out for what it is. I tried &lt;a href=&quot;http://drchip.wordpress.com/2008/10/04/disagreements/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drchip.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/bias-on-the-hoof-hanson-and-ru-continued/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to get Hanson to reconsider the matter or give evidence, but he would not (see his comments, and judge for yourself).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Mark, Robinâ€™s wife did not hear a story about someone else being fired â€” she heard from the person who was fired.&quot;

Yes, FOAF would seem to imply that these stories are two levels away, but many people will move the level up one. It&#039;s just an unconscious need to make the story more immediate and vivid and place oneself at the center of the action.

In the case of my workmate, his mother knew the person supposedly involved. Now I didn&#039;t contact her and ask her about it, but the story (involving a person who fainted from cut-off circulation due to some sort of device in his pants to make it appear that he had larger genitals than he really did) was a classic piece of emergency room lore described by Brunvand.

Mind you, I&#039;m not saying that anyone at all is lying. It&#039;s just that people&#039;s minds play tricks. This is the entire basis of the study of folklore, and not only anthopologists, but many journalists have run across this phenomenon. And I&#039;m not saying that such a study, if actually done, would not turn up the results claimed. It&#039;s just that the particular details and person involved are unconscously fabricated.

Why don&#039;t you try to actually contact the nurse involved. If it&#039;s really just one person away, it shouldn&#039;t take much time. And if she was fired, she has nothing to lose and shouldn&#039;t mind speaking to you. Make sure to get back to us with your results. ;-)

The way I see this is that at some point some medical professional hypothesized to another that if such a study were done such a result would ensue. Then a couple of people down the line, the story became that the study actually was done. Then at some point in passing this fable along, someone made the crack that, yeah, and the nurse would probably get fired for her trouble. And a few levels away from that it wasn&#039;t a crack but a fact. And the urban legend went on from there, each time with a little more certainty added to it. (By the way, an excess of details that anticipate objections are one characteristic of urban legends.)

The comments to this post show how much interest there is in the medical community about the issues raised by the story. Urban legends flourish the most when they &quot;confirm&quot; the opinions of large numbers of people in the community in which they are passed on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[RU, the cost for medical care plus insurance overhead etc is something like 16% of GDP and rising. It&#039;s already more than we can afford.

I can&#039;t expect MDs to do anything that might reduce their guild; privileges, but it&#039;s plausible that insurance companies and government might want things to reduce expense. That could include public health measures and improved self-screening approaches.

My father is a retired dentist. Back when fluoridation was new he campaigned heavily for it. Some other dentists said that he shouldn&#039;t because he&#039;d be cutting back on business. &quot;Cutting his own throat.&quot; But he argued that there would be plenty of dental business even after fluoridation, and he was right.

Currently, more things to make people ill won&#039;t increase medical payments much. The money just isn&#039;t there.]]></description>

As you can see from all these replies, &quot;retired&quot; means I have a lot of spare time. You sound a lot different now than in your original post. Plumbers=doctors is not only right, it is exactly what I said (&quot;guild&#039;). Your attitude seems a bit naive in that you wish for doctors to promote a system that would somehow transfer the benefit of their experience to the patients without a paid encounter. That&#039;s where the guild concept comes in. Doctoring is a &lt;i&gt;job&lt;/i&gt;, which requires a incredibly long apprenticeship. The doctors plan for you to pay for the service, as much as the traffic will allow, for as long as you are willing to do so. Just like plumbers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[RU, I suspect we&#039;re pretty much in agreement all round.

I did my own lit search because that was what I knew how to do. I had access to a medical library, so I could get any paper that wasn&#039;t too obscure. I knew how to do lit searches quickly and efficiently and I was quick to pick up the material.

But that was no substitute for direct experience. I had no idea that my girlfriend&#039;s symptoms would subside in 6 months. It wasn&#039;t true for the people in the studies. But those people were chosen because their symptoms were serious enough to deserve careful attention.

I could tell after the fact that she was a plausible candidate for DVT. She was on estrogen, and was somewhat overweight. She got a bad bruise on a mountaineering trip and then drove long hours with no rest break. But I&#039;d never seen it before.

The surgeon, however, gave DVT to over a hundred people a year. He&#039;d seen a lot of cases and he knew what to expect.

I&#039;m not complaining about that. I&#039;m just pointing out that doctors are more like plumbers than they&#039;re like scientists. When you call a plumber you don&#039;t expect the latest scientific results in plumbing. You expect he has the judgement and experience to do the job, and if he doesn&#039;t you hope he&#039;ll refer you to somebody who does. Same with MDs. We currently have no way to transfer that judgement and experience over the internet or through medical libraries, either one.

I can imagine a way to begin to do that. We&#039;d put all patient records into a database, with some attempt to allow anonymity. So then say you have flu symptoms. You put your symptoms into the database and it tells you about what happened to other people with symptoms like that. 97% of them had flue and got over it. A few had histoplamosis, a few went on to have coronary disease, a few had this or that other problem. So then you can reduce the search to people who&#039;re around your age, and/or gender, and/or your geographical area, and/or whatever else is available, and maybe you get a different result -- fuzzier but different.

Every few days the database could email you to remind you to tell it how you&#039;re doing, and if you don&#039;t respond it checks the death records etc to see if you can&#039;t respond....

It wouldn&#039;t substitute for the personal touch but it would provide a whole lot of data that anybody could mine. We have something like that now for insurers, but the data is mostly private and it&#039;s organized around diagnoses more than symptoms and test results.]]></description>

<p>I could tell after the fact that she was a plausible candidate for DVT. She was on estrogen, and was somewhat overweight. She got a bad bruise on a mountaineering trip and then drove long hours with no rest break. But I&#8217;d never seen it before.</p>
<p>The surgeon, however, gave DVT to over a hundred people a year. He&#8217;d seen a lot of cases and he knew what to expect.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not complaining about that. I&#8217;m just pointing out that doctors are more like plumbers than they&#8217;re like scientists. When you call a plumber you don&#8217;t expect the latest scientific results in plumbing. You expect he has the judgement and experience to do the job, and if he doesn&#8217;t you hope he&#8217;ll refer you to somebody who does. Same with MDs. We currently have no way to transfer that judgement and experience over the internet or through medical libraries, either one.</p>
<p>I can imagine a way to begin to do that. We&#8217;d put all patient records into a database, with some attempt to allow anonymity. So then say you have flu symptoms. You put your symptoms into the database and it tells you about what happened to other people with symptoms like that. 97% of them had flue and got over it. A few had histoplamosis, a few went on to have coronary disease, a few had this or that other problem. So then you can reduce the search to people who&#8217;re around your age, and/or gender, and/or your geographical area, and/or whatever else is available, and maybe you get a different result &#8212; fuzzier but different.</p>
<p>Every few days the database could email you to remind you to tell it how you&#8217;re doing, and if you don&#8217;t respond it checks the death records etc to see if you can&#8217;t respond&#8230;.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t substitute for the personal touch but it would provide a whole lot of data that anybody could mine. We have something like that now for insurers, but the data is mostly private and it&#8217;s organized around diagnoses more than symptoms and test results.</p>

RU, that was my point. My understanding of statistics etc from my biomath training might give me a much better ability to understand randomized trials than most physicians -- a large portion of them wind up not at all showing what the authors think they do.

But that&#039;s no substitute for experience. I couldn&#039;t look at her leg and tell whether her PPS was really serious. All I had to go on were a few pictures and a lot of wordy descriptions. The surgeon could tell at a glance that it wasn&#039;t that bad because he had experience. He had DVT and PPS as complications for his surgery patients &lt;b&gt;all the time&lt;/b&gt;. 

I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if I knew much more of the literature about those topics than he did. But that was no substitute for experience, and I knew it.

&lt;i&gt;The medical guild has published all their information on the Internet. Good for the patients, bad for the guild.&lt;/i&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[RU, I googled &#039;deep venous thrombosis&#039; and got 1.5 million hits. I googled &quot;post phlebitic syndrome&quot; and got only 28,000 hits. Years ago when I did that search it was only 9000. The ones I looked at emphasized the worst cases.

Maybe my search was biased but I tried to include lots of randomness to pick up things I didn&#039;t know I was looking for. I believe the bias was in the literature and not much in my search of the literature.

The prestigious surgeon we talked to had not publisned anything about DVT that I could find. But he had sufficient experience to say that her PPS would probably subside with no problems. And he turned out to be right. DVT was not a research interest for him, it was just a complication he saw a lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;This sort of encounter is becoming more common among doctors and their patients of equal or superior intelligence. The medical guild has published all their information on the Internet.&lt;/i&gt;

Well, no. They haven&#039;t published all their information. They&#039;ve published the information they bother to publish.

Some years ago my girlfriend had a deep venous thrombosis. It started out extremely serious and then it stabilized. She&#039;d need to use a pressure bandage for the rest of her life and maybe have some circulation problems etc. I did a lit search and the results were pretty horrendous. I was upset. She got a referral to a prestigious surgeon who reassured us. 

&quot;Why do you think there&#039;s any problem here?&quot;
&quot;I did a lit search and the published literature was pretty scary.&quot;
&quot;Why do you think you could understand about that?&quot;
&quot;I&#039;m a biomathematician. I can follow the literature but I don&#039;t actually have any experience.&quot;
&quot;Well I do. I see DVTs *all the time*. There&#039;s nothing to worry about.&quot;

My girlfriend started a regular exercise program. Pretty soon she was feeling mostly recovered.

The trouble was, they didn&#039;t publish about it unless it was something serious. There&#039;s a great big publication bias.

If you go to a plumber he won&#039;t have engineering studies that show the way he does his work is the best way. There are probably engineering studies taht show everything he does is sub-optimal, that there are newer methods that work better. But he has a big body of experience, most of it handed down to him, that says what he does works.

Doctors are a lot more like plumbers than they are like doctors or engineers. When you consult a doctor you are depending on his experience and his training. Hardly any of that is published or publishable. It is deeply unscientific. But on average the doctor has some idea how well it works, although you can&#039;t depend on him to truthfully tell you how well it is likely to work.]]></description>
