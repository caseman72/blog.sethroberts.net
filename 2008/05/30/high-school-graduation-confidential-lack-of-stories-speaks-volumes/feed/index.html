		<description><![CDATA[[...] Krafcik repeated an old Jay Leno joke: &#8220;How do you double the value of a Hyundai? Half-fill the gas tank.&#8221; So he had a great story to tell, the return from ignominy, but curiously he barely told it. Probably this was because he was working at Ford at the time. I have no great interest in cars, I&#8217;m not particularly interested in why one company does better than another, yet I was entranced. I came away thinking that most of what I&#8217;d heard about public speaking was wrong &#8212; most of the stuff in Made to Stick, for example. Sure, the advice to tell a story &#8212; and most speakers don&#8217;t even understand that &#8212; is right. Krafcik did tell a story. But that&#8217;s the easy part. I think everyone understands what a story is. The harder part is convey emotion.Â  Carl Willat has said to me that in movies, that&#8217;s all that matters. Absolutely, and I think what&#8217;s he saying applies to talks as well. Of course an academic talk must have content. But the practical lesson for me is that when planning a talk I should pick something I care a lot about and in the talk do my best to convey how I feel. That&#8217;s all. Don&#8217;t worry about telling a joke, don&#8217;t worry about slick visuals, don&#8217;t try to impress them. I plan to show Krafcik&#8217;s talk to graduate students (in psychology) because it makes a point I doubt they&#8217;ve heard: It&#8217;s fine if it&#8217;s other people&#8217;s work that you feel strongly about. Krafcik isn&#8217;t the head of Hyundai. He had nothing to do with their long comeback. But he&#8217;s proud of his company &#8212; and he conveyed that in spades, and that was enough. Suppose you do research on X. You&#8217;re giving a talk about it &#8212; perhaps a job talk. Maybe your research is mediocre. But you think research on X is incredibly important. Fine &#8212; just make that clear. Everyone in the audience will like you for being able to appreciate the work of others, that&#8217;s so rare. When you point them to other work that is great, you&#8217;re helping them. Suppose you&#8217;re teaching a class. Find the parts of the subject that you feel strongly about. Do your best to convey how strongly you feel. Better positive than negative but negative works. (Ask Nassim Taleb.) Avoid the parts you don&#8217;t feel strongly about. [...]]]></description>

Exactly.  The point that Taleb is making is that we are hard-wired for storytelling or rather, interpreting the world through stories.  And to employ as unbiased reason in order to make truly rational decisions , one has separate our innnate desire for the narrative explanation i.e. don&#039;t get fooled by randomness.]]></description>

Edward Tufteâ€™s background is in statistics, which is not usually associated with effective storytelling.  You might be interested in John Allen Paulosâ€™s thoughts on this in Chapter 1, â€œBetween Stories and Statisticsâ€ of his book &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Number&lt;/em&gt; (1998).

		<description><![CDATA[Not everyone has forgotten: Joel Spolsky of Joel on Software addresses exactly this point in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/BestSoftwareWriting.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Introduction to the Best Software Writing&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;s not in the context of graduations, obviously, but in it he makes a similar point. 

Incidentally, I bought the book and keep meaning to write about it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jseliger.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Story&#039;s Story&lt;/a&gt;, as the essays are a) interesting, b) tell stories and c) offer a rich load of metaphors for other fields of endeavor. And if he manages to produce another volume, I&#039;ll be sure to read that too -- not because I&#039;m particularly interested in software, but because the pieces are so compelling. And why are they compelling? Most tell stories, as you say.]]></description>
