		<description><![CDATA[I think soap is both the cause and the cure of skin problems. Chemical soaps cause problems and natural soaps cure. 
Soap should be simple and free of chemicals or any complicated words in the ingredient list. The base of soap should be Lard as this is the most similar to human skin. Simplicity is generally the best solution and with something placed on your skin daily, you need to trust that your soap is naturally pure and clean and will therefore make your skin clean and natural as well. If your soap cleans up your skin and doesnâ€™t leave any chemicals on it, then it can finally get clean and be clear of acne.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m surprised about this post because I learned from my parents never to use soap on my face when I was about three years old. (I still never do; water only.) I had always assumed this was something that all children learned, like putting your trash in the trashcan. This may be a cultural difference. (I live in Germany)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Soap seems to be a holdover from the days when people used to bathe in cold or lukewarm water and share bathtub water (several people might bathe in the same tub of dirty water).  In addition to once a week or once a month baths -- Nasty.  My experience is that you do not need to use soap or shampoo at all in a modern hot water shower unless you are unusually dirty.]]></description>
