I noticed that that both students quoted were &quot;he&quot;.  One of the arguments for single-sex schools is that boys and girls have different learning styles.  Boys do best in classes where they can move around and don&#039;t have to be quiet.  Girls do better in the traditional format-- sit at your desk and listen quietly to the teacher.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;In its all-boysâ€™ classes, students are not required to sit still and be quiet. They are welcome to stand or sit or curl up under their desks, or jump up and down if they like. Just about anything is allowed, short of punching a classmate. When I first entered the classroom, it didnâ€™t look like any classroom I had seen before. It looked more like a can of worms or a beehive, with boys gyrating, bouncing, and buzzing like bees. But the boysâ€™ dynamic teacher, Jeff Ferguson, assured me that his students were paying attention and, in fact, they were thriving with the more relaxed format.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
