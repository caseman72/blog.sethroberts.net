		<description><![CDATA[Reminds me of something I learned from a friend of mine when I was an undergraduate at SUNY Stony Brook. He was taking a course on parasitology and apparently, most of the significant early work (pre 1900) in the field of parasitology came from a small but dedicated group of parasitologists who studied their parasite of choice by infecting themselves with it and logging the results. They then wrote their self-experimental results up in scientific publications that the other members of this group read. So there is a precedence (probably many if we looked harder at the history of science and medicine) for Bains&#039; proposal.]]></description>
