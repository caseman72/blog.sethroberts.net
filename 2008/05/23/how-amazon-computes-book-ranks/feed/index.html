		<description><![CDATA[I also wonder about several things: is the rank based on book count volume, or $ volume?  I am guessing $ volume.  I also wonder if it is some kind of decaying rank (sales today count more than yesterday which counts more than 2 weeks ago).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Seth.  I don&#039;t know if this helps, but our recent book sold about 4000 copies in 9 months--that would be about 15/day in total, not just Amazon, and it&#039;s typically ranked around 5000 on Amazon.  My point is that technical books such as mine sell proportionally more on Amazon, while Stephen King etc sell more in stores.  I&#039;m not sure where your book falls in this spectrum.]]></description>
