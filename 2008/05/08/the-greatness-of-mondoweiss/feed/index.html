		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to make a comment about the situation Modoweiss blogs about.

Most Americans would be well served if every time a map of Israel was displayed it was superimposed over a major metropolitan area in the U.S.

People would understand a lot of things a good deal better if Californians realized that Israel and the West Bank are, together, smaller than Los Angeles County.  Texans would be surprised that Israel is not as large as the complete Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.  Etc.

The entire scope and perspective of the conflict need to be better understood, I think, and a good start would be helping people to get just how small of an area we are talking about.]]></description>
