		<description><![CDATA[maybe being on your feet triggers energy during the day.  being on your feet a lot could mean there&#039;s some benefit to being on ones feet, and so more energy is provided by your body to keep up the beneficial behavior (might explain why runners get addicted to running and feel nervous when not running).  but since one is expending more energy on one&#039;s feet, one sleeps better.  there is a greater need for recuperation.

it&#039;s a bit like your dieting theory.  the body economizes on behaviors, doing them when they are most beneficial and cutting back on them when they aren&#039;t terribly worthwhile.  maybe in the stone age we benefited from days of long exploration on our feet sometimes, but at other times it was best to relax and not wander around too much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess the problem with experimenting like this on consecutive days is that there&#039;s no way to know whether the first day&#039;s activity has impacted the second...do you think it&#039;s necessary to decide, for each experiment, how much time must elapse between tests to be sure this effect does not apply?
