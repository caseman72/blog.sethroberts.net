		<description><![CDATA[Japanese grammar has a lot of do with it...There are basically 4 different levels of formality (1-you absolutely better not park here, 2-don&#039;t park here, 3-please don&#039;t park here, 4-you are higher on the social scale than me, and I beg you, please don&#039;t park here and you can even go higher than 4 in some cases). Level 3 the default.

Level 1 is reserved for when you intend to scold someone.  It&#039;s often heard when you have cranky mother punishing a kid.  Otherwise, it&#039;s usually the stuff of movies and comic books.  The rest are pretty polite and going from 2-3 is really simple (1 word tacked on the end) so most people do it out of instinct.  In English we usually stick please on the front end as if we&#039;re explicitly trying to be nice about it.  For Japanese, everyone just tacks it on the end.

Anyway, I&#039;d be curious to see how this compares with the stuff in Robert Cialdini&#039;s books on influence.  He cites research that if you can give a reason (even an illogicial one) for anything it&#039;s much more effective than having no reason.  So &quot;No parking&quot; fares much worse than &quot;No parking because it&#039;s not allowed.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe we should slap emoticons on street signs.

No Parking :)

On a related note, some phrases in English strike me as formally polite, but are often aggressively used.  &quot;Excuse me?&quot;  &quot;Do you mind?&quot;  &quot;Thanks a lot.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some of those things might be so formulaic as to have lost their politeness in the original language. I stayed with a French family as an exchange student. Their daughter had missed a few days of elementary school to go to the doctor. They received a letter from the school that started &quot;I have the honor to inform you that your daughter, Sophie, has missed three days of school...&quot; They said &quot;I have the honor to inform you...&quot; is just how the school starts all letters.

I&#039;m a technical writer now. We routinely edit out any words like &quot;please&quot;...the goal is to make the prose as squeaky clean as possible. People read documentation as a last resort anyway. We figure extra words waste their time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. I noticed the polite nature of public signs in use in Hong Kong. Since the signs are all written in both Chinese and English, I wasn&#039;t sure whether it was Chinese politeness or British politeness (or both). The British also seem to be more polite in these matters, too. Perhaps its the tea (as opposed to coffee drinking Americans who are more direct and gruff).]]></description>
