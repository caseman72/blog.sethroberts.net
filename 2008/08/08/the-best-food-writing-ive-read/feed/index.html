Remember the Seinfeld episode where George gets mad when he finds out Susan&#039;s cousin named her baby &quot;Seven&quot;? I always wondered if they were poking fun at Ms. Lee, the only person I&#039;ve seen with a number in her name (besides The Prisoner).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that&#039;s a good point about food being psychologically inert.  it seems like shifting from list-making to a sort of problem-solving process aimed at obtaining some strongly desired aesthetic experience might be more engaging, along with the dramatic tale you recounted.  chef as struggling artist, or mad scientist.  &#039;how can i make this good?  how can i make this good and affordable?  how can i make this not boring anymore?&#039;

i have a good friend who likes to talk about food.  i&#039;m inclined to think he and his foodie acquaintances, when they are talking about food, are in part, demonstrating they care, sort of like the stereotypical jewish or italian mothers.  &#039;i hope you like this salad.  it had x, y and z in it.  i care about what you ingest, and here is what it is.  it&#039;s only the best for you!&#039;

maybe that form of communication is being carried over to food writing?]]></description>
