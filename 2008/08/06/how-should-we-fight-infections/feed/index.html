		<description><![CDATA[To complete my thought: In that case, looking for environmental cause of wintertime liability to infections would be a dead end.

On the other hand, it coudl be Vitamin D! (BTW, in light of the new studies on Vitamin D, doesn&#039;t it strike you as scandalous that this reasearch wasn&#039;t done decades ago? You&#039;d think that correlations between all well-known nutrients and population health would be considered basic statistics, the public-health equivalent of the national census.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suppose another possibility is that the body&#039;s cold-fighting ability has an annual rhythm. Perhaps the systems that fight off infection need a respite after a period of intense activity. If the organism&#039;s most important activities (reproduction, food-gathering) take place in summer, it may sense to schedule the down time for winter. The obvious alternative - maintaining a lower but constant level of robustness year round - might be suboptimal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just to raise more potential contributing factors, there is the stress from the holiday season to consider, plus all of the extra travel from Thanksgiving to Christmass/Hanuka (sp?), then New Years. This raises the question as to whether infectious illnesses like the common cold are more common in winter in ALL cultures or largely in western society?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that inadequate sleep can be a contributing factor to getting a cold. That&#039;s definitely been true in my case. Given time to catch up on sleep and some Zicam zinc lozenges I can fight off any cold. 

As for why colds are more common in the winter, I read &quot;somewhere on the internet&quot; that this is due the fact that the in colder, less humid weather the mucus in your nasal passages dries up making it easier for the germs to get in. 

My guess would be some combination of factors. I&#039;d be interested to see data about when cold season starts in the northern areas versus southern areas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dennis &amp; John, I have seen at least one study showing that sleep is worse in the winter. There is a reference to it in that self-experimentation article. I believe sleep is worse in the winter because there is less morning light -- that light increases the amplitude of a circadian oscillator that controls sleep is not exactly a revolutionary idea. But even if I&#039;m wrong, something that has a big effect on rate of infection changes a lot from summer to winter. If it turns out to be Vitamin D, for example, that would be very helpful to know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t buy the bad sleep in winter thing. Not true for me.

Besides, I thought it was the lack of vitamin D which caused colds and influenza in winter (unless you lived someplace sunny that is).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For a long time now, I&#039;ve noticed that I sleep much better in the winter when the ambient indoor temperature is cool (and I can snuggle up warm and toasty under the covers) than in the summer, especially when it&#039;s hot. In warm weather especially it takes me longer to fall asleep, I feel less comfortable in bed, I wake up more frequently, have more bouts of insomnia, and wake up earlier than when the weather is cooler. I love summer but I always dread the uncomfortably warm sleepless nights.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[dennis, i thought it was odd too that sleep could be worse in the winter.  i had an odd thought: if you sleep poorly in winter, you might be groggy and therefore not able to do much during the day, limiting your energy expenditure when you might need to conserve it.  in the summer, if you sleep well, you have energy to make use of the long days.  winter tends to be associated with depression, which manifests sometimes as low energy and poor sleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t think of any reason why sleep should be worse in winter; as far as I can tell, it ought to be better due to longer hours of darkness. As for the relative increase in colds during winter, several other factors come to mind: less sunlight means less vitamin D production and thus weaker immune systems; less sunlight also means lower microbicidal ultraviolet radiation; cold weather means people are indoors more and can more easily communicate pathogenic microbes to each other.]]></description>
