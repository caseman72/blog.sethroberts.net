		<description><![CDATA[Igor, I don&#039;t think there were any unusual sounds while I was sleeping. It wasn&#039;t unusually quiet, as far as I know.

Mike, the voices were behind the mirror, not behind me. The effect was that looking at my face while listening to voices was a lot more realistic since the voices appeared to come from the face, rather than somewhere else.

Peter, I completely agree. I hadn&#039;t heard that before about the breath right strip resolving apnea, that&#039;s really helpful to know.  Those sleep labs tend to conclude you have disordered breathing whether you do or don&#039;t, according to Insomnia by Gayle Greene.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OT, but related to sleep.  there was segment on sleep apnea on pbs&#039; news-hour that talked about an elaborate diagnostic procedure (sleeping in lab hooked up with wires etc.) and treatment that consisted of sleeping with equipment attached to one&#039;s face; both of which would be fairly expensive.  
     it turns out that i have had sleep apnea for several years and that merely using a breath right strip across my nose resolved the problem. (i didn&#039;t have a scientific diagnosis, but the before and after difference in my sleep was clear).  the point is that i did self-experimentation rather than be drag into the medical establishment to spend thousands of $$$. (one of the great things about reading your blog is that it leads one to consider and try self-experimentation).  It may be that this simple inexpensive &quot;treatment&quot; may not work for everyone, but it ought to be tried before sufferers/society incur the expense of a cumbersome and often ineffective &quot;medical&quot; treatment. 
   There are other simple treatments as well, such as a applying wrap to one&#039;s head (from the chin to to the top of the head) to force one to breath thru the nose.  
    I don&#039;t see these simple treatments discussed on-line and they weren&#039;t discussed in the pbs piece.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi igor,

i was referring to having the radio behind oneself while looking at oneself in the mirror.  i hadn&#039;t thought of effects of noise on sleep.  i can&#039;t recall being bothered by snoring myself (though maybe i don&#039;t remember).

having people talking around you seems an anti-depressant to me.  i used to work in a closed office by myself and being a retiring person, i got a bit isolated, but then i had office mates and the door to my office remained open to the hustle and bustle of people outside it, and i believe my mood got better overall.

obviously there could be other causes to my better mood, but it does seem true there&#039;s some apparent correlation between hearing people talk and feeling good.  placement of the voices seems to speak to trust--if you don&#039;t trust people you seem likely to keep them in front of you, and if you trust them, behind you, so if you have voices behind you, it might trigger a feeling of security and friendship, which seems a plausible cause in elevating mood, as seth&#039;s experiment might suggests.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

I was not thinking in that direction (more in the direction that that night, Seth has not heard any noise/sound) but this is interesting. However, how would one explain that snoring is a major impediment for others to sleep in groups ? I am also of the opinion that snoring is also detrimental to the snorer as their noise is bound to make their sleep light.

		<description><![CDATA[You also leave out of the equation the actual eight hours of sleep!

Do you know for a fact that no specific sound/noise (however small) occurred during your sleep ?

 If one were to follow the &quot;prehistoric&quot; man story you like to come back to, shouldn&#039;t an uneventful sleeping state be correlated with a sign of no surrounding predators and therefore be correlated to a good sleep ?

Just wondering...
