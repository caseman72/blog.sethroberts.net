		<description><![CDATA[Achieving a steep learning curve can feel difficult, because there can be much to learn in a short time.  I think you are correct to note that the term is hardly ever used to describe situations where it was easy to go from low to high performance.  Intuitively, a steep hill is one that is hard to climb, so the phrase is naturally associated with situations where learning feels like quickly climbing a steep hill.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ah, thanks for this.

I always used it wrongly for a different reason. I use it to mean &quot;difficult&quot; (which would be an axis of Effort and Time).

Good to learn where I&#039;m wrong (again)

		<description><![CDATA[The normal usage of the phrase is very closely related to the actual meaning, though.  When someone says &quot;product X has a steep learning curve&quot;, they mean &quot;product X requires that you go from low to high performance very quickly to use it&quot; -- it&#039;s a product that isn&#039;t worth using if you&#039;re not going to learn quickly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s routinely used correctly in industrial manufacturing, where it refers to cost reductions that result from manufacturing experience and competition.  There, cost starts at a normalized 1 and declines exponentially toward an asymptotic horizontal somewhere (presumably) above zero.]]></description>
