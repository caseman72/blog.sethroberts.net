		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post.  This revealed the importance of checking the source and accuracy of information before making an judgment.  
The risk of stereotyping is often overlooked, just as in this case.  We could perform lots of scientific experiments and conclude results based on &quot;facts&quot;.  However, it is imperative to reveal the procedures and ensure that all &quot;facts&quot; presented have been critically examined.  When I was at school doing chemistry experiments, I often found the results differing from the theory quite a lot.  Why? There are a lot of factors which could affect the accuracy of the experiments.... Again, it is too unfair to all parties by just looking at the results, without understanding what&#039;s behind.  This applies not only to scientific &quot;experiments&quot;, but also to social observations.
If you were the teacher of the students, what would you have advised the students?

		<description><![CDATA[[...] The students used iodine titration to determine Vitamin C levels. Why had the students managed to see something important that the food giant overlooked? My guess is that an unusual processing step (e.g., high storage temperature) destroyed the Vitamin C and those who knew about the anomaly didn&#8217;t want to consider the possibility that it had done damage. The possibility that someone outside the company might notice didn&#8217;t occur to them. Just as those who mislabel fish in New York restaurants and markets never realized that two students could uncover their deception.

		<description><![CDATA[The term &quot;statistical fluke&quot; is usually applied to differences between groups. Group A and Group B differ by some amount -- does this mean the populations from which they were sampled actually differ on that dimension or could the results be due to sampling variability?  If they are due to sampling variability, that means the observed difference is a &quot;statistical fluke.&quot; In the fish case, there are not two groups. So I have no idea what he&#039;s talking about.

You can&#039;t have sample sizes be &quot;[statistically] significant&quot; or not; it is differences between groups or differences from zero that are statistically significant or not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,

As someone who works in the market research industry I like the Samantha Powers story and think the article makes a good point. I am more torn on the questions you raise in your post. As you know from &lt;a href=&#039;http://paynowlivelater.blogspot.com/2008/07/are-we-underrating-anecdotal.html&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my post about the under-use of adecdotal evidence&lt;/a&gt; I am a big believer in not letting valuable evidence leak away.

I was slightly confused by your statement

&lt;i&gt;I have no idea what it could mean that the results are â€œa mere statistical flukeâ€&lt;/i&gt;

since it seemed from the article that the author was saying it was &lt;b&gt;unlikely&lt;/b&gt; to be a fluke. So in that respect he seems to be on the same  page as us.

It is just the sample size issue where there is divergence, and in this respect what I am wondering is this: he has obviously applied some formula to determine whether the sample size can be taken as significant, whereas we perhaps prefer to apply a commonsense interpretation of the results and sampling methodology - but there must be a point at which sample size does matter even for that approach - for example, could we have viewed a sample of 3 as having the potential to be regarded as a statistical fluke?
