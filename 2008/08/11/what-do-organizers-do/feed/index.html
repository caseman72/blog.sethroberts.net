		<description><![CDATA[that&#039;s a neat idea.  your own personal &#039;fixer&#039; so to speak.  to me this person seems to help people who have overdrawn on their finite willpower and don&#039;t have anymore to deal with stress, so they pay someone else for his or her willpower, so to speak.  your willpower is like your car, and when you run out of gas, the car stops, and you hail a taxi.

this idea comes from, i think, a paper tyler cowen linked to at marginal revolution, on willpower as a finite resource, and the paper suggested that when we ran out of willpower, we engaged in behaviors normally restrained by willpower (drinking, binging on food i suppose), or i suppose we failed to do things that willpower would have forced us to do (like taxes, or cleaning up room).  this made so much sense to me.

does this idea of finite willpower connect with your theory of procrastination at all, i wonder?]]></description>
