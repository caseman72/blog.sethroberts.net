		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The a priori defined exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) no data in humans, 2) no original data, 3) observational epidemiologic study, 4) no random allocation, 5) no vitamin-mineral supplement as intervention, and 6) no subclinical marker of atherosclerosis as outcome&quot;

Seeing as how supplementation is a subject so prone to bias, I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s such a bad thing.  Do we need 100 new minerals claiming to be the cure to heart disease?  A thousand new snake-oil salesman to hock them, because they&#039;re unregulated and so easily obtained?  What makes you think a simple dose of vitamins deserves to cure one of the biggest killers out there?  Maybe it wouldn&#039;t have hurt to list the major culling criterion, but they started out with one huge filter: looking for effects on heart-disease.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan, the discarding of the &quot;bad&quot; studies was done, I&#039;m sure, according to widely-accepted rules. It wasn&#039;t tailored to this particular situation. But it is truly bizarre that this sort of thing is considered reasonable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I take the meta-analysis to mean that if you want to discount the benefits of antioxidants, you must discard 2295 out of 2311 controlled trials, or 99.3% of them.  What other proposed therapy is robust enough to stand up to such treatment?  Probably not even aspirin.]]></description>
