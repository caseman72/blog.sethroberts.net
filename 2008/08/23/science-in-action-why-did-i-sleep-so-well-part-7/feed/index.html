		<description><![CDATA[Nansen, yes, that&#039;s correct. I have found that the standing alone -- without the other factor -- produces the effect. But I&#039;ve only observed this a few times. I&#039;ll go from &quot;almost sure&quot; to &quot;sure&quot; when I observe it a few more times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not clear that you have in fact separate the effects of the two factors, i.e., test one without the other (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/08/17/science-in-action-why-did-i-sleep-so-well-part-4/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;part  4&lt;/a&gt; of the directory).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Super interesting. I look forward to hearing more! How many days do you think you would take to compare various protocols (when is best to stand, how long is best to stand, etc). It is also interesting because it helps develop balance, which is a neglected aspect of many people&#039;s fitness. A great article about balance in the NYTimes notes that 1/3 Americans over 65 are injured every year from a fall: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/health/08brod.html?ex=1357448400&amp;en=d2e8cfe20029acbe&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink

(I&#039;m also curious about whether that statistic is meaningful! I know lots of over-65s who aren&#039;t injured from falls, and can only think of one one I have even known who was injured from a fall. Nonetheless!)]]></description>
