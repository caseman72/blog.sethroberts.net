		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m impressed that he responded to your email at all.  But you have to remember that this reporter talks to lots of people.  My guess is that he&#039;s an expert in hearing people out and in presenting different points of view, not an expert in evaluating expert judgments.  The reporter is showing good judgment in taking your comments seriously, even if he&#039;s not going so far as to fully address them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If the 14 establishments were randomly selected from the population of all NYC fish sellers, then we could use the fact that 8 of 14 had mislabeled fish to estimate what percent of fish sellers have mislabeled fish using standard statistics, the same way that polls calculate the margin of error.  Using the exact binomial distribution, I&#039;m getting that we could be 95% confident that between 29% and 81% of fish sellers have mislabeled fish (again, assuming a representative sample).]]></description>
