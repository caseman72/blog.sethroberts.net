		<description><![CDATA[[...] Seth Roberts, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley, suggested a new show you might want to check out in response: I came across this test after spending a pleasant morning analyzing data while listening to the first six episodes of Denise Richards: Itâ€™s Complicated which I found on YouTube. (Such as part 1 of Episode 1.)

		<description><![CDATA[oh that&#039;s interesting.  i do the same thing when i&#039;m editing (which i don&#039;t like doing)--i listen to shows or podcasts.  i was doing some editing while basically listening to episodes of dexter yesterday and it makes the editing so much easier.

i&#039;ve wondered if politicians could benefit from having their own reality shows.  john mccain seems to get a lot of his likability from making himself very available to journalists.  what if he had a reality show while on campaign that ran regularly on his website.  would that increase public liking of him?  i suspect so, but i&#039;d imagine it would have to be kind of a &#039;warts and all&#039; kind of show, rather than some idealizing-the-person show.  this i suspect would apply to lots of politicians, though perhaps some people are so unlikable that getting to know them makes you like them less--i imagine they are a minority though.]]></description>
