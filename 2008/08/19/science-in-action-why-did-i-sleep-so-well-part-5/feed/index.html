		<description><![CDATA[When I did my balancing tests (standing on one leg) my sleep did not noticeably improve. I don&#039;t make anything of this because I would typically balance for 5 seconds or so perhaps 30 times with substantial rest between bouts. Whereas now I am standing 3 minutes or so at one time, that is, with no rest (and doing this 4 times/day = 12 minutes total/day). Old way: not stressful at all. New way: very stressful. I&#039;m sure you need stress to get the effect (if there is one) because I got no sleep benefit from standing until I got up to 8 hours or more per day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this works!  I&#039;ve got a Wii fit that I hadn&#039;t been using much lately and decided to do 30 minutes of the &#039;stand on one leg&#039; exercises they had (~3 yoga poses, ~3 &#039;strength&#039; exercises) and I ended up waking up about 1.5 hours earlier and feeling pretty good (although the day&#039;s not over yet).  Obviously it&#039;ll need more trials/comparisons with other exercises, etc. but it&#039;s a promising find.

Seth, you mentioned during your omega-3 posts that you used balancing on one leg as a test--were there any sleep differences while you were running those tests?

Anyway, be curious to here if others get the same result.  The wii fit does seem like a decent platform for self experimentation since you get a score and logs of how long you did each exercise for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Igor, I just stand on one foot. No moving around. Maybe 3 minutes isn&#039;t long, I don&#039;t know. I do know that in any yoga class I am the worst student.

Philip, by &quot;exhausted&quot; I mean my leg starts to hurt and to continue would be more than slightly uncomfortable. Nothing to do with balance. 

Curious, while I&#039;m doing this I&#039;m holding my other foot bent up behind me. Because I found that many hours of standing produced similar effects, I discount the stretching aspect of my pose. My previous research (standing many hours) involved no stretching.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I usually spend most of my day sitting in front of a computer and don&#039;t sleep as well as I&#039;d like (though not terribly).  Yesterday, inspired by this series of posts, I raised my computer 18 inches and worked for several hours standing in front of my desk.  I slept very well last night and plan to stand for several hours today as well.

I also found that standing helps fight drowsiness, so I plan to stand while doing some of my more boring research work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Are you talking about just standing on one foot or tiptoeing on one foot ? 3 minutes seems to be a small number to get exhausted, or am I missing something ?

Cheers,

Igor.]]></description>
