		<description><![CDATA[Everything mention in the above messages is true to some extent but all these ideas must be place into a coherent hypothesis. I believe my essay (see below) does this. It may not be correct but it answers most of the questions that still puzzel researchers.

		<description><![CDATA[The humorous response (including the release of neurotransmitters and endorphins, instant responses in the autonomic nervous system and a reduction in stress hormones) is also, of course, broadcast as laughter, signalling that one has recognized the pattern in question. This humorous response has both voluntary and involuntary neural networks and, consequently, the response can be attenuated or extenuated in certain circumstances. However, laughter is only a minor part of the major cognitive process known as humour, which is fundamental to perceptual proficiency and has played a vital role in the evolution of humankind&#039;s unique intellectual capacties.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that&#039;s interesting.  Do you have results with unfamiliar spices alone? or have you seen an additional weight loss effect with unfamilar spices.  

What would constitute an unfamiliar spice?  Must it be totally unfamiliar or just not associated with that food? (I guess the latter, since you suggest sprinkling cinammon on pizza?)  I did try cinammon on pizza once and didn&#039;t notice anything except a weird taste! 

Dr hirsch claims that &quot;The Tastants slightly enhance the flavor of your food without changing the flavor. In fact, you probably won&#039;t even notice they are there!&quot;  How do you reconcile that with your flavor - if one doesn&#039;t notice it, how can new flavor connections be made?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know how Hirsch selected the flavors he used in his research. Good question, I will try to remember to ask him. Yes, according to my theory any unfamiliar flavor will work.

Nor do I know why they switch after a month. That might have been the most often they could switch. The effectiveness of many diets seems to wear off after 6 months or so. I think they stop being effective -- the lost weight starts being regained -- because the diet caused the dieter to eat food less strongly associated with calories and new associations were learned over months. if I&quot;m right, apparently it takes months to learn them enough so they make a difference. That sort of data supports Hirsch&#039;s choice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[also the subjects used these flavors for a whole month, and only switched sets of flavors at the end of each month.  Isn&#039;t a month a long time dont you theorize a flavor connection is made more quickly than that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thanks for your answer and sorry to be so slow to respond. 
He claims to have tested which flavors work best.  Unfortunately in response to my query, they informed me their product is not kosher.  Do you know anything more about his research or which flavors are supposed to work?  IIUC according to your theory, any unfamiliar flavor would work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of status, don&#039;t forget to account for social status in laughter: people are much more likely to laugh at jokes made by their superiors than their inferiors, and in the presence of a person of high status, members of the same group will check whether the superior is laughing before laughing themselves.

People are also more likely to laugh aloud if other people are present, and less likely to do so when no-one can hear.

All of these things seem to point to laughter having a social signaling function that goes beyond the simple expression of pleasure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;ll have to check out veblen.  i wonder if there are any obvious evolutionary psychological explanations for this phenomenon, too.  i&#039;m sort of at a loss on that count!  i can imagine alpha males not doing drudge work, and having others do it for them, and i can imagine nobles taking on this alpha-male-like role.

i tend to not think of academics as a sort of power-elite, like nobles or alpha males, but perhaps this is a mistake.  there is some reverence towards the well-educated.  i wouldn&#039;t be surprised if alpha males tended to have high iqs, given cleverness seems an asset in gaining and maintaining power.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, 

this question isn&#039;t related to this post.  I saw this recently:

http://www.trysensa.com/how-sensa-works.htm

this diet is supposed to work by sprinkling flavors (different sets of flavors each month) on food.   Average weight loss is claimed to be 30 pounds per six months, or 5 pounds a month.   

Is this related to your work/diet?  Do you think it should work? Do you know anything about it? Thanks.]]></description>
