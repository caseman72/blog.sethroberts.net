		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Keeping countries in the same order promotes a kind of global coherence - the presentation matches usersâ€™ expectations.&lt;/i&gt;

@Chris

I think what you are saying is that since The Economist thinks its readers are lazy, they should be lazy too.  

You could say the same about not using log scales, many readers don&#039;t expect to see them, so why use them?

The average reader of the The Economist has an IQ that is more than enough to process such data presented in a meaningful manner.  By organizing multidimensional data in such a lazy manner, that is, alphabetically, The Economist casts away immediate and intuitive meta data that surely its high-income, highly-educated readers value.  This is not People Magazine we are talking about here.    

&lt;i&gt;Besides, the typical user wonâ€™t read the chart thoroughly; they`ll scan for the one or two countries they`re interested in.&lt;/i&gt;

I don&#039;t think so.  I think, at the very least, people will want to see their home country and then the greatest and least in the same category.  And then, who they are comparable with.   Alphabetization does not help them at all.  

My stats professor always joked/stressed, presenting data alphabetically is criminally irresponsible.  And after a few thousand corporate PPT presentations, I agree.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In fairness to The Economist, they produce countless charts of cross-national statistics. Keeping countries in the same order promotes a kind of global coherence - the presentation matches users&#039; expectations. Besides, the typical user won&#039;t read the chart thoroughly; they`ll scan for the one or two countries they`re interested in. 

On the other hand, I`d say there`s a case for them organizing countries by region rather than putting them in one alphabetical list.

Tie-wearing? It really depends on your work environment. The underlying factors here is (IMO) dress as an indicator of ability to read social cues.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Patrik, I agree. I&#039;ve heard Andrew Gelman make this point several times.

OneEyedMan, &quot;reserved for series with geometric growth&quot; -- not at all. There are lots of other cases where log scaling is an improvement, such as power-law-like histograms. The power-law (Pareto distribution) similarity is nearly invisible unless you use log scales for both the x and y axes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Allow me to add to your list of incompetence giveaways:

&lt;strong&gt;Ordering (ostensibly) meaningful multidimensional data in alphabetical order*, especially in charts and graphs.&lt;/strong&gt;

This makes me insane!  All of the major media do it all the time.  Once I noticed that The Economist even does this, I lost a lot of respect for it.

http://www.economist.com/markets/bigmac/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11793125

Look at the Big Mac Index, it would make a helluva lot more sense if it was ordered (largest to smallest or smallest to largest) by either the 3rd, 4th or 6th column items.

*Yes, alphabetical order makes sense for, say, a guest list or any other sort of one-dimensional list.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The simple answer is: Because doubling in size in a year is equally impressive whether the absolute change (end point minus starting point) is a small number or a large number. The more complicated answer is: Because plotting size on a raw scale means that major changes in the rate of growth at smale scales (e.g., between 50 and 500) will be invisible if some of the growth takes place at large scales (e.g., between 5000 and 50000). Interesting structure, if present, will be invisible.]]></description>
