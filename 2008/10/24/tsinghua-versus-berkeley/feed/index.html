		<description><![CDATA[How did I structure the class &quot;so that students learned what they wanted to learn&quot;? I let them do whatever they wanted -- volunteer work of some sort -- off campus. We met once a week and talked about it. In other classes, I let students do their term project on whatever they wanted so long as it was off campus and not library research (thus pushing them out of their comfort zone and requiring them to do something new). They inevitably did something they wanted to learn about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, could you comment on how you structured the class so that students learned what they wanted to learn? Did you start out with a syllabus that changed throughout the semester? Did you start out with no syllabus at all? How did you solicit information about what students were interested in learning?]]></description>

Also, you write &quot;Columbia University has taken a step in the right direction by having no classes on Friday.&quot;  This must not be the Columbia University in New York, where I teach on Fridays every semester!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why are Tsinghua undergraduates fun to teach? Nadav, I haven&#039;t yet taught them, but I know enough to say you are exactly right: They have similar strengths and interests as the professors.

Tsinghua undergraduates are indeed like Caltech undergrads. I think that every day -- I was a Caltech undergrads. That might be the American example closest to Tsinghua.

Who has incentive to change the current system? Well, the students do, obviously. Berkeley professors would like to teach much less. Which would happen if someone else -- those who would enjoy teaching Berkeley students -- did more of the teaching. The taxpayers would benefit from an economically less wasteful system (and the parents among them would like to see their children happier and better appreciated). I think all three sides have incentives to change. But I agree with your overall point, which is that the system is hard to change. Perhaps the big barriers to change are three: 1. Change would require acknowledgment of how bad the current system is, and that would mean acknowledgment of the self-serving lies that have been told about it (&quot;we&#039;re teaching them to think&quot;). 2. The future system would probably contain fewer research professors. Maybe a lot fewer. 3. The biggest victims of the current system are students, who are relatively powerless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All so true.  (Well, the parts about the Berkeley undergrad experience, anyway.)  But even if we all agree, under the current system, who has an incentive to change the status quo?  No one.  The anomaly isn&#039;t Berkeley - the anomaly, at least based on what I&#039;ve seen of the US higher education system, is Tsinghua.  

A more interesting comparison to Tsinghua might be with Caltech - are their undergrads all grade grubbers with disinterested research-focused profs?  I&#039;ve heard otherwise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post.  Good on you.  

&lt;i&gt;When I taught a class that helped Berkeley undergraduates learn what they wanted to learn, my colleagues complained. According to them, my students werenâ€™t learning proper psychology. Itâ€™s true, they werenâ€™t. My students were learning what they themselves wanted to learn instead of what some professors thought they should learn.&lt;/i&gt;

Nothing like a little professional jealousy courtesy of colleagues mired in the status quo.  

I have to say, one of the things I very, very much enjoy about this blog is your honesty regarding higher education.]]></description>
