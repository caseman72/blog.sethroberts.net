		<description><![CDATA[Tim Ferris has a few interesting thoughts on this.  He is quite the self-promoter and I think, very prone to hyperbole, but, in his defense, does make some incisive observations on language acquisition.

(Ignore the bombastic titles and exaggeration)

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, are you learning to read/write Chinese as well? I took a year of it at UCLA (sat in on the undergraduate level 1 course) which helped me immensely. The grammar is actually quite easy, but the tones take some getting used to. For me the killer is the huge quantity of homonyms. Not only are there four ways to say any particular phoneme, each way can have multiple meanings depending on context. The same pronunciation of &quot;shi&quot; can mean &quot;TV&quot; or &quot;stone&quot; or a bunch of other things as well.

Keep it up, it is a very interesting language.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If I were in Sweden, no one would volunteer to teach me Swedish.&quot;

I assume you&#039;re talking about fairly large commitments of time and effort, because one of the most common interactions I&#039;ve observed between tourists, or exchange students, and Swedes is helping each other learn a little bit about the other&#039;s language. Travelling I&#039;ve found that one of the easiest ways to strike up conversation is to ask strangers to help me pick up a little of the local language.

I do think Sweden might be interesting to study if you want to learn more about adults learning a new language.

Since we&#039;ve had huge immigration rates the last few decades there&#039;s tons of observations about mandatory Swedish classes not working and self motivated learning working really well.]]></description>
