		<description><![CDATA[This post is dumb. The whole argument is stupid. What dermatologists say is that no link between acne and diet HAS BEEN PROVEN. For every study that detects a correlation between foodstuff X and acne, there are ten that do not. Then stating that diet is the cause of acne is irresponsible because it is not backed up by the evidence.

Also, if you suffer from severe acne, take a good long look at your parents and their grand parents skin. Odds are very high that they have acne scars and did or do have acne problems. How can that be? Two generations ago people ate healthier yet still had acne. How can people who are allergic to diary products have acne if it is the diary products that are causing it? 

People had acne back then too, and that means that the dietary argument is false.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My story: In college, I started getting cysts on my face.  They would often start off as whiteheads or closed pimples and then just grow and grow.  They was extremely ugly.  They would take weeks to finally go away, upon which there would usually be a scar to mark the spot.  

I tried reforming my diet, that is cutting out all junk food.  I also tried the standard antibiotics and retin-A regimen.  It didn&#039;t really seem to make a difference.  (For what it&#039;s worth, I have never had a soda habit).  

What finally worked was drastically reducing my intake of dairy products.  My small pimples would just stay their normal size and clear up quickly.

I also had a habit of nervously touching my face and of resting my face on my left hand.  I noticed that I had far more pimples and cysts on my left cheek than on my right.  So not touching my face helped.  

Finally, I felt excerise also helped.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Just wanted to say first and foremost that I really enjoy you blog. I have always found that creating a diet full of natural supplements and organic goodies has always helped me stay clear of acne. I recently started a blog about green tea and its effects on my weight loss and as well its anti oxidizing powers that have helped my acne.  My latest post describes all the scientific properties behind green tea which help with anti-oxidizing, you can view it at &lt;a&gt; Green Tea Blog&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
