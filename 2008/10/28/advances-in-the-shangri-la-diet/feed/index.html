		<description><![CDATA[Since both carbs and wheat gluten are bad for you, it seems silly to consume them noseclipped so you can&#039;t even enjoy them.

You can easily find many good sources to support my claims about carbs and wheat.  However, I highly recommend the Hyperlipid blog as a starting point:

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if the Shangri-La diet would work with lard?  I know lard has a bad reputation, but quite simply put:  That is bullshit.  

A couple of interesting links:

http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2008/03/l-word.html

&lt;i&gt;The fatty acid profile of lard might give us a clue. A major portion of lard is monounsaturated, 40% by weight. This is the same type of fat that predominates in olive oil (73%), and which is widely recommended by mainstream nutrition experts. Another prevalent class of fat in lard is saturated, at 48%. More than one third of this saturated fat is stearic acid, which even the most hardened lipophobe will agree has a &quot;favorable&quot; effect on blood lipids. Then there&#039;s the 8% polyunsaturated fat, which has been the darling of mainstream heart disease research for decades due to its ability to lower blood cholesterol (for the record, I believe the polyunsaturate content is lard&#039;s least healthy feature). The omega-3:6 ratio depends on how the pig was raised, but is typically skewed more toward omega-6.

So what does that leave us with? 66% fats that we&#039;re told are heart-healthy, and 30% non-stearic saturated fats that are supposed to be unhealthy. But if you still believe saturated fats cause heart disease, check out this post, this one and this one. Well if the fat composition of lard isn&#039;t unhealthy, then what else could be the problem?&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Igor, thanks for the link. My wife was recently pregnant. I asked her doctor if it was a good idea for my wife to increasing omega 3 consumption during her pregnancy. She said yes if the source was fish oil but not if it was from flaxseed oil. She said there were data indicating that pregnant women had greater difficulty processing flaxseed oil, due (I guess) to the hormonal changes during pregnancy.]]></description>
