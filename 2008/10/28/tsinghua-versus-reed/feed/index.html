		<description><![CDATA[Stuart, yeah, apprenticeships are &quot;natural&quot; teaching. I&#039;m sure that how things worked for many thousands of years. 

Aaron, I don&#039;t mind universities teaching something besides job skills but they do a miserable job of it. Professors at universities such as Berkeley and UCLA often claim that they teach &quot;critical thinking&quot; -- and fail to grasp the far greater importance of curiosity and appreciative thinking. In my experience, professors at Berkeley, on average, fail completely to teach either one. All that Berkeley professors really can teach -- and quite well -- is how to be research professors. I saw this in class after class. When they claim that they can teach anything else, I scoff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I&#039;d be curious to hear your thoughts on how well prepared the students are for the challenges after school.  I&#039;m American educated (grad degree) been living/working in Japan and actually have had a chance to visit Tsinghua as we have a branch office amidst all the tech companies near there.  

My interpretation of Asian vs. American education models is that Asian ed is successful at knowledge transfer but not at teaching self-reliance and an ability to learn outside the classroom setting while the American one (through factual failure?) teaches self-reliance at the expense of knowledge.  

For successful americans, they learn social and some skills in primary school and then education gets progressively less hands on through high school and then are given a &quot;we won&#039;t spoon feed you any more&quot; environment in college where you have to really learn to figure out what you want to do, who you want to be friends with etc.  After college, the (successfully?) western educated realize that they have to keep figuring things out to be successful in life and so they continue to strive and the marketplace rewards those that figure out more things. 

In Japan/China they start the same way but if you&#039;re considered the cream of the crop (via test taking) you end up at schools where they 1) hand hold the students and 2) praise their students as being the best of the best in effect creating what Carol Dweck coined as the Fixed Mindset where you&#039;re considered so smart that fear of failure becomes an impediment.  

In work, I struggle in hiring Asian educated students from the top schools.  They know a lot more about physics, engineering, literature, history, etc. but they have a lot more trouble learning how to get things done in a non-academic setting and create advances out of fear of failure.

Self-experimentation to me is all about a personal inclination to learn.  It&#039;d be great to hear through the months where you see experimentation in China coming from--is it from the specially groomed elites or from the worker class?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, What you describe sounds like an apprenticeship, which is what graduate student training is like. I use this approach with my graduate students and post docs, but also with the undergraduate assistants in the lab, as well as the occasional high-school student. This method works great and is very enriching for both the master and the apprentice. It is, however, impractical when a large number of students are involved. I teach a course with 250-300 students, another with about 70, smaller seminars of about 5-20 and a lab course which I limit to 10 students so that we can do a manageable project (a rat study) together.

Speaking from my experience as an undergraduate at SUNY Stony Brook, I enjoyed my classes the size of 250-300 as much as the smaller seminars. I got something out of each one, and I knew what the constraints of each format were. I recognized from the very beginning that the large lecture hall classes are largely a one-way dissemination of information to lay the landscape for a particular field of knowledge and investigation. After having established some groundwork, I could then take smaller, upper-division courses where I could explore a particular topic in more depth and in a more intimate setting. I enjoyed both formats and excelled in both. I think one problem that occurs in college is that many students want to get a job or a career rather than an education. Education in science, arts, humanities, etc., involves more than just practical skills, which of course are very important. But moreover, getting background knowledge in many spheres of interest (i.e., a broad education) allows one to use the critical thinking skills one hopefully also acquires in college to make a life and career. As a psychology professor, I see a lot of students that just don&#039;t get that psychology is not just a practitioner&#039;s field, but also is a field of investigation with a scientific and philosophical basis. Some of these students discover the joy of scientific discovery accidentally, but some of them resist it thinking that it is a waste of time. Maybe for them it is a waste of time, but then they had been misled about what psychology is or what a psychology major entails.

Yes, teaching is difficult and takes time away from scholarship and research. But every time I teach, I find enjoyment, pleasure, and discovery--whether it is the large lecture course or small seminar. Also, I have made many insights that led to changes or enhancements in my own research during the process of teaching. Teaching has truly enriched my scholarship. And, there are always students, often many, who honestly report enjoying the courses they have taken with me. Tough, yes. Rewarding, you bet!]]></description>
