		<description><![CDATA[When my MIL visited China in the late 80&#039;s, she came back with the story that crossing the street was so dangerous that she took a cab.  We laughed.  We adopted both our daughters from China and I want to testify that nothing could get me to cross a street!  The pedestrian has no &quot;rights&quot;.  One morning our guide tricked us into crossing a busy street because she thought we were wasting our money on taxi fare.  It was a very scary minute.
