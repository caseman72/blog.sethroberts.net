		<description><![CDATA[I e-mailed IAOMT to ask them about this question of mercury vapors rising vs. falling.  I have quite a few amalgam fillings in my mouth, so I want to get to the bottom of this.  I&#039;ll post another comment if and when I get a response from them.

As for Stephen Barrett, he tends to go after the easy targets.  I&#039;d have more respect for him if he exposed the pseudoscience behind more-conventional treatments that have no basis in science.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Chip, that&#039;s helpful. As for the Quackwatch article, it&#039;s by Stephen Barrett. My mom told me he criticized a website named Planetree that helps average people get medical research information. I suppose he felt they couldn&#039;t be trusted with it; the details of his criticism are no longer on Quackwatch. Given that attitude, I don&#039;t take him seriously.

I&#039;d guess the criticism of the video is right. But I also think the video probably makes a correct point: mercury probably does leak from your mercury amalgam fillings into your body.]]></description>
