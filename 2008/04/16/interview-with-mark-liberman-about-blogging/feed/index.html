		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth, thanks for the insightful co-mingling of themes on amateurism and gossip with these responses from Liberman. His Language Log style of using data to advance a conversation beyond simple opinion is an inspiration to us amateurs in the &quot;gossip&quot; business. It&#039;s a style that differentiates good gossip from mere gossip. When you try to emulate it, you find yourself working harder at blog entries, learning more in the process, and also getting more fruitful, thoughtful comments from readers that in turn inspire better blog entries -- a virtuous cycle. And it is hopefully a cycle that leads this kind of amateur blogging to &quot;fill a gap&quot; (as you mentioned in the other article) between the true professional and the truly unreflective gossiper.]]></description>
