		<description><![CDATA[[...] Blogs as gossip, and gossip as support structure for amateur&#160;science  Seth on blogs as gossip and what role they can play in increasing the diversity among the practitioners of science: Blogs are just new-fangled gossip. Bloggers are endlessly scandalized, indignant, judgmental, just as gossips are. Just as gossip is usually â€œpassed on,â€ most blog posts have links and many posts consist almost entirely of â€œpassing onâ€ something. Just as gossip can be anything, bloggers can say what they really think, as Tyler Cowen pointed out. Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re so successful, so easy to write and read. Gossip is good for our mental ecology, just as science is. Mark Libermanâ€™s Language Log blog is a blend of (good) gossip and science; as you can see from my interview with him, it filled a gap. I hope blogs will provide a kind of support structure on which amateur science can grow. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gossip is more primal than news.  It is fundamental to our species&#039; ability to grow beyond small bands in which everyone knew each other.  Gossip and the prefrontal cortex are inextricably linked -- it is where we store our stories about who we are, who we&#039;re ideally supposed to be, and who others are.  That lobe is where society and politics live, and gossip is the data that fills that lobe.  &quot;Does he do his share?  Can he be trusted?  Who are his allies and his enemies?&quot;  If we know these answers about strangers, there is no limit to our society&#039;s size.  And we know how to behave in a way that keeps us from being destroyed.

It&#039;s been said, and subsequently disproven, that tools are what make us human.  I would argue that gossip makes us human.  Even crows use tools.  Humans use gossip.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;bloggers can say what they really think&quot;

Depends. I could easily create a few blogposts that might end your career if you posted them under your name. That&#039;s why I use a pseudonym. As it happens, I&#039;ve never posted anything that most people would find strongly objectionable (I think), but I like having the freedom to not even have to think about whether a post might be bad for my career.

Still, blog authors have a high degree of freedom to write what they want, but I don&#039;t think that is the main reason that I read more blogs than professional sites on a typical day; I think the main factor is sheer mass. The main reason you can find blogs you like is the same reason you can find a forum for people that get sexually aroused by bird feathers or whatever: There&#039;s just &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; out there.]]></description>
