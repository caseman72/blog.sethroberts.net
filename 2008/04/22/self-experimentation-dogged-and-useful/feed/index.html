		<description><![CDATA[That site is one of the biggest black hole of consciousness I&#039;ve visited on the net since like the 90&#039;s.  The guy is probably mentally ill.  

I used Supermemo for a couple months.  The program is analagous to the website.  So much crazy crap added in, and it still doesn&#039;t have basic usability features.  Content creation is pretty tough, so I think you need dedicated peers to make it work.  

If I were to start doing it again, I&#039;d lower my projected retention rate.  It was definitely not working for learning new material--the sets just blew up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s also an open-source version of a similar concept, at http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/.  It supports pictures and sounds as well as text, and uses a somewhat older version of the SuperMemo algorithm.

Personally, when I saw this, I was really excited at first, and then I realized I don&#039;t have much use for jamming my declarative memory full of facts.  It would be much more useful to have a way of quickly adding things to your procedural memory: then you could install new eating or exercise habits, or other daily routines.  (Let alone the whole, &quot;let&#039;s download Tae Kwon Do and how to fly a helicopter&quot; scenario in the Matrix movies.)

Know of anybody who&#039;s got software for that?  ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is an extremely cool and provocative article. So, I can&#039;t help but to  think about what kind of an effect omega-3 + the &quot;spacing effect&quot; would have together. I&#039;m guessing that maybe omega-3 would &quot;flatten&quot; the forgetting curve a little bit. Maybe I&#039;ll experiment on my kids a little.]]></description>
