		<description><![CDATA[Great post.  

While I am suspicious of all studies, even ones that confirm my POV/biases, I think this study ultimately leads to what I got from Taubes&#039; book and others.

We simply do not know if the Lipid Hypothesis is valid, nor if cholesterol levels, or accompanying levels of lipoproteins signal/indicate anything.  And if they do, how to interpret them as markers.

I suggest this to people at cocktail parties and am always roundly laughed at.  No one ever takes me up on my (perhaps Aspergian) offer to provide them with reading materials that may enlighten them.   

My guess is that we have suffered a lot from the mis-information cascades of the low-fat diet and the lipid hypothesis --- and as humans, as long as we remain intellectually arrogant, will continue to in nutrition and other fields.]]></description>
