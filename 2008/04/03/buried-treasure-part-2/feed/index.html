		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Hypothesis testing improved. Hypothesis formation, however, did not improve. Knowing how to do a t test and the philosophy behind it will not help you come up with new ideas.&lt;/i&gt;

Exactly!  I have had the misfortune of taking a graduate degree and one of the most irritating  aspects of it was the fetishism on hypothesis testing and rather intentional devaluation of hypothesis formation.  This resulted in quite a few, extremely intelligent and creative (and subsequently frustrated) people being sidelined and passed over for their (relative) weaknesses in statistical methodology, while their unfairly devalued talents and insights clearly lay in what you call hypothesis formation.  I always thought this was a tremendous waste of human capital.]]></description>
