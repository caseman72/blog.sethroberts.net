		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Chris, interesting point. The toothpaste man is using a system that has thousands of nouns. (And can easily make room for even more.) The higher primates have just a few object-specific vocalizations. I&#039;m saying that the many-noun system evolved because of trade. If you have a lotta stuff to trade you obviously need a more flexible system -- I think the word is &quot;scalable&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This is exactly the effect I propose that the very first words had: They helped two traders find each other. Having a word for knife made it much easier for the person who had a knife to trade to find someone who wanted a knife. [...] In a Guatemalan market, I heard a man shout â€œtoothpasteâ€ (in Spanish) over and over. He was selling toothpaste.&quot;

Yet there&#039;s evidence that some higher primates have vocalisations associated with particular objects - types of food for example. Yet they don&#039;t trade. What they have may not be language, but it would be as much language as your toothpaste man is using.]]></description>
