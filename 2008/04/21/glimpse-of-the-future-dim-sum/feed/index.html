		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Why is this remarkable?  Isn&#039;t that the nature of all, or almost all, scientific discoveries?  Recognition is a motivation, but my impression is that psychological studies have found that recognition doesn&#039;t bring much happiness at all.  (I have to say, it&#039;s brought me some happiness, but I&#039;ve just always assumed that I&#039;m more recognition-loving than most.  I imagine you&#039;re closer to the norm.)

P.S.  I guess I should correct this slightly, since some scientific discoveries bring negative happiness.  For example, I once met the guy who invented napalm.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s an interesting way to put it because countless times I have thought something with a similar logical structure but more positive: The remarkable thing about this discovery is that whatever recognition I get for it won&#039;t bring me as much happiness as the discovery itself.]]></description>
