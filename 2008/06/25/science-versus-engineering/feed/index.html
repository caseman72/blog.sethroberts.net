Anderson says â€œfaced with massive data, this approach to science â€” hypothesize, model, test â€” is becoming obsolete.â€ Anderson confuses statistical models with scientific ones. As far as the content goes, Iâ€™m completely unconvinced. Anderson gives no examples of this approach to science being replaced by something else. [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll definitely try that, although, the fact that I have to work (office job) Monday through Friday would require that I start out only getting the morning light on weekends...

Oh: Could it be that staring at a computer monitor at night makes me want to go to sleep later and wake later?  

Thanks,

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

You said:
&quot;That larger canvas came along when I tried to figure out why I was waking up too early.&quot;

I know this a bit off topic, but, in dealing with this question, did you discover any possible means by which a person who chronically sleeps late could be made to spontaneously wake &lt;i&gt;earlier&lt;/i&gt;? 

Thanks,
Araglin]]></description>
