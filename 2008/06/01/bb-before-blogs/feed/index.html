		<description><![CDATA[Hey, you&#039;re the one who made the &quot;exactly never&quot; claim.  I think if you go to back issues of the Village Voice you&#039;d find about 3 zillion examples of Jewish journalists criticizing other Jewish journalists of pro-Israel bias.  Since neither of us is being paid to do this, I doubt either of our assertions will ever be checked, but that&#039;s my impression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What Philip Weiss wrote was not merely an example of  &quot;[Jewish] journalists criticizing other [Jewish] journalists&quot;. It was very specific criticism: criticism of pro-Israel bias. It is this specific criticism that I claim is very rare or non-existent. If I&#039;m wrong I&#039;m happy to learn that -- but you haven&#039;t provided an example. It is too vague to say &quot;back issues of the Village Voice&quot; or &quot;Norman Podhoretz&quot; or &quot;Hannah Arendt&quot; (who wasn&#039;t a journalist).]]></description>
