		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe how silly this post is. &quot;Evidence snobs?&quot;

So basically what you&#039;re saying is: If you want evidence that something works, you&#039;re a snob. 

Seriously? 

Double blind studies are important because they remove human bias. Yes, you can argue that if something works without a double blind there is &quot;evidence&quot; for it, yes, you can say that in this particular case there was some very bad personal interference. But To say this somehow makes double blind studies a snobbery is pretty irresponsible, and frankly, stupid. 

A good double blind study -will- tell you if a drug is &quot;sometimes&quot; effective. You should know that. What it will also tell you is how statistically relevant that outcome is. 

I find all of this boogey-manning of the &quot;medical establishment&quot; to be a little weak. It&#039;s basically a thinly veiled conspiracy theory. 

Maybe you already know these things, Seth, but look at the people commenting in your threads. Many are basically clueless about the scientific method and a lot of them are conspiracy theory types who&#039;s intellectual laziness should warn you that they are not the kinds of supporters you want. 

If you spend a minute thinking about it, you can either attribute their comments to zaniness, or perhaps conclude that your posts on occasion aren&#039;t diligent enough to clearly explain to these people what you are getting at. 

&quot;Evidence Snobbery.&quot; Come on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: As one who has long been wary of a medical establishment that only respects the results of studies -- and, even sadder, the results of studies that they believe have been conducted in the â€œright way,â€ by the â€œright researchers,â€ at the â€œright institutionsâ€ (or by the â€œright pharmaceutical companiesâ€), and written about in the â€œright journalsâ€ -- I find your ideas wonderfully refreshing. (Of course, many of us know that a majority of these so-called â€œstudiesâ€ that doctors trust so much are carried out by pharmaceutical companies with pre-ordained agendas, and that these studies therefore come to conclusions that will benefit the companies themselves. Scary.)

Concerning â€œFirst Do No Harmâ€: Although it was made in the 1990s, the action of this wonderful movie takes place in the 1970s. And you are very right that, at that time, most doctors believed that drug therapy and surgery were the only â€œprovenâ€ treatments for childhood epilepsy. Many still do.

But, their belief, even then, was misguided, and -- I can only conclude -- shaped by financial interests. For one thing, as the movie pointed out, the diet has been used very successfully for decades at Johnâ€™s Hopkins, under the direction of John Freeman, MD, and registered dietician Millicent Kelly.

But, even more puzzling, since 1925, there has been a huge amount of published literature extolling the efficacy of the diet.

For instance, on April 4, 1925, one of the â€œrightestâ€ of journals, the AMAâ€™s own JAMA, published an article, â€œThe Ketogenic Diet in Epilepsy,â€ in which M. G. Peterman, MD, reported on the results of a study at the Mayo Clinic, in which 37 children with â€œessential epilepsy,â€ between 2-1/4 and 14-1/2 years of age, were treated with the ketogenic diet. The results were stunning, with a majority of the children experiencing improvement. In fact, quoting from the article, nineteen, or just over 50% â€œhave been free from attacks since the institution of this treatment.â€

JAMA published the results of another study in 1927, the conclusion of which was that â€œtwenty-nine of ninety-one patients suffering from idiopathic epilepsy have been freed from attacks by means of the ketogenic diet. Twenty others are definitely improved, so that 54 per cent have been definitely benefited by the dietary treatment.â€

Similar studies were published in every decade thereafter. And to my knowledge, the results reported in all these studies are much better than those achieved by any anti-epileptic drug.

So, why did the doctors in â€œFirst Do No Harmâ€ react the way they did? Frank Lefevre, MD and Naomi Aronson, PhD, in an article (â€œKetogenic Diet for the Treatment of Refractory Epilepsy in Children: A Systematic Review of Efficacyâ€), published in 2000 in â€œPediatrics,â€ the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, offer a possible rationale: (See http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/4/e46)

Quoting from their article: &quot;This diet was used as a treatment for epilepsy fairly commonly in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1930s and 1940s, as effective antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, were introduced into clinical practice, the ketogenic diet was largely replaced by drug therapy.&quot;

I received my education about the ketogenic diet from Hollywood producer/director/writer, Jim Abrahams, the man who deserves a huge amount of credit for spreading the word about the diet. Jim is the man responsible for â€œFirst Do No Harm.â€ His own experience with the diet, which worked so well for his son Charlie (when nothing else, including surgery, would), has led him to labor tirelessly since the 1990s to promote the use of the diet. Through his Charlie Foundation, Jim has produced and disseminated informational videos, and regularly sponsors training seminars for professionals so they can become qualified to implement their own ketogenic diet programs. Thanks to Jimâ€™s efforts, the ketogenic diet is now available in many hospitals in both the US and abroad. (Estimates range from 65 to 200 programs worldwide!)

You may read Jimâ€™s and Charlieâ€™s inspiring story at http://charliefoundation.org/, where youâ€™ll find lots of other resources, as well.

In addition, I have written an article, â€œFour Lifesaving Medical Treatments: Not So â€˜Anecdotal,â€™ After All.â€ My article features the ketogenic diet -- as well as three other equally impressive â€œanecdotalâ€ treatments. It is posted on my website, at http://www.honestmedicine.com/2008/05/four-lifesaving.html

Thanks much for the work you are doing. Hopefully, together we can (finally!) get the word out there.
