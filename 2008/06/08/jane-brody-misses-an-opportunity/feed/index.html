		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth,
This anecdote reminds me of something Ralph Miller said in one of our lab meetings. &quot;Data never overthrew a theory, only another theory overthrows a theory.&quot; So long as the medical community and its customers (i.e., us) continue to spout the AMA party line, there not only will be a refusal to accept the new theories like that discussed in Taubes&#039; GCBC (I say this with a laugh since the new theories are really the old ones!), but a blindness to one&#039;s own self-based data.
