		<description><![CDATA[Silent celiacs have an uncurable addication to iceberg lettuce when they exhibit when iron deficient. They may also chew on things -- like clothes, anything close to their mouth. Autistic children are reported to exhibit the same thing. In celiac (wheat -intolerance), the gut becomes fenestrated (&#039;leaky&#039;) and blood leaks out into the stools.  Perhaps our bodies respond to ancient signals that defy our current understanding??

In the nutrition world this is known as &#039;pica&#039;.  

Thanks for this post! This explains a lot that we observe. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a nice theory you have, but I have to disagree a little. 

I think the lip licking and lip touching has more to do with nervousness or interest in a person. We lick our lips and when we do so, they are for a little while moist and glistening, which is the same effect you get from lip gloss. It&#039;s a way to draw attention to your mouth. I won&#039;t go in to detail, but it is also a sort of reference to something else. 

Also, by licking our lips, we show our tongue, or part of it, for a split second, which could be seen as another way of showing interest and wanting that someone to notice you. 

The lip touching has the same use, to draw attention to our lips. 

It&#039;s a simple way of intentionally, but mostly unintentionally, show that you are interested in someone. It doesn&#039;t have to be someone you&#039;re in love with, just someone you just saw and found attractive/cute/sexy whatever.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I think you&#039;re now taking your conclusion and searching for somewhat tortured justifications for it - e.g., maybe 20 times is helpful but 100 times is harmful.  As far as I know, it&#039;s commonly held that licking your lips dries them out, and it&#039;s consistent with my experience.  If you disagree, why not try licking your lips various numbers of times per day and see if it keeps them moist?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth, Cliff is right. I have a nervous habit of licking my lips sometimes and all it does it dry them out during the day by removing the natural oils on the surface. After hours of licking my lips I have to start using lip balm! Maybe there&#039;s a benefit to licking lips - but it ain&#039;t keeping them lubricated!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. you are talking about normal lips and you are wrong about normal lips.  There are no lips that licking makes moist, that is the bottom line.  If you don&#039;t believe me, do a little research, then revise your theory because it does not fit reality.  Think about it.  Would washing your hands really often keep your hands moist?  No.  It dries them out.  Try washing your hands 100 times a day and see what happens to your hands, they will be destroyed.

If you bothered to google, you would find stuff like this:

http://www.ehow.com/how_2115815_cure-chapped-lips.html
http://www.carefair.com/Skincare/Tips_to_Stop_Biting_Your_Lip_1427.html

Looks like unanimous agreement- don&#039;t lick your lips.

Btw, I have been watching people who are busy, and have not seen any lick their lips.]]></description>

I&#039;m still not sure I understand the connection between touching one&#039;s mouth and maintenance of moist lips; wouldn&#039;t touching a dry hand to your lips dry them further?

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This mechanism evolved because it kept our lips moist.&quot;

How does touching our lips w/ our hands keep them moist? More importantly, why is keeping them moist important? 

I agree with your suggestion of periodicity and with licking taking over when we&#039;re mobile. Both of these attributes, however, to me suggest a larger purpose - and I&#039;d posit that moist lips are a great surface for capture of local microflora whether by contact with air (while mobile) or by direct sampling (with hands, while seated). Swallowing would then allow for a measured immune response and a constant re-adjustment of immune capability to the local microflora environment. Same goes for swallowing mucus from the nasal passages.]]></description>
