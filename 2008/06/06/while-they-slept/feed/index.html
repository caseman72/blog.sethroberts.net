		<description><![CDATA[I asked someone who works in the child protective system about this. She said the whole system is broken, in many ways. Caseworker overload, caseworker burnout, corruption, etc. She thought The Wire was accurate. I said, &quot;Why do we bother to have a system that fails so completely? To make politicians look good?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes, there is that. Politicians are in office for 2 or 4 years. They won&#039;t fund something that would produce results when they&#039;re out of office.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sad story.  In defense of the social worker, maybe he or she had heard made-up stories by kids a lot in his or her line of work.  When I was in pre-k (so very young) I told my mom that my teacher hand-cuffed me to a chair.  I&#039;m pretty sure I believed this to be true at the time, though it seems highly doubtful now!  My mom asked the teacher about it, probably to get a sense of what really happened.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;No child abuse: no.&quot;

What&#039;s more, there&#039;s even a commandment on honouring your parents. Unconditionally, that is. That was a popular favourite in religious education: &quot;Why should I honour my parents if they hit me?&quot; &quot;What if my dad&#039;s a murderer?&quot; I&#039;ve never heard a decent answer.]]></description>
