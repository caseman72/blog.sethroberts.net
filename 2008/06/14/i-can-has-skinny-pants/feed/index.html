		<description><![CDATA[Seth, yours will be the last laugh.

I secretly laugh too when I see so many of the people who sneered at Shangri-La who are still overweight, still dieting, still hungry, while I have gone from 160 lbs. to 116 lbs. in one year and loved every minute of it.

â€œâ€¦after I read a NYT article on his research and findings. It just dang ol&#039; made sense...in a twisted way.â€

â€œYou add flavorless calories to your diet twice a day. Don&#039;t have anything with flavor (not even brushing your teeth or chewing gum) for an hour on either side. And that&#039;s it.â€

â€œ..Also, two words: shot glass.â€

Thatâ€™s exactly all I did, with some nose-clipping, and without trying to improve something that was already excellent.  I also now have skinny pants.

Who wouldnâ€™t laugh?  Itâ€™s so simple, itâ€™s hilarious.]]></description>
