		<description><![CDATA[Hey Seth, the link you post in this post leads to an article by Brian Appleyard&#039;s mood being effected by breaking his low-carb diet -- very interesting, but it doesn&#039;t seem related to the link title (Nassim Nicolas Taleb&#039;s Low-Carb Diet) or to the relationship between sleep and carbs.  What&#039;s the connection?

Also, the article&#039;s description of his sudden mood change when he took in carbs is interesting, but wondering if it is suggesting something -- that low-carb diets are bad for mood for instance.  I have heard that it takes a couple weeks to adjust to low-carb, during which time you can feel tired and even sick, but that afterward you end up with more energy, a better metabolism that reduces body fat etc.  So could Appleyard have been experiencing a temporary adjustment?

I would definitely be interested in more discussion on this one as I&#039;m reading more about, and increasingly convinced by, low-carb diets including so-called paleo-diets.  Again, it may be a matter of personal physiology though, whose success is exposed through self-experimentation.

Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently started eating breakfast regularly and I&#039;ve noticed positive results (strikingly less hunger throughout the day and evening, plus an overall more positive mood).

The nice thing about breakfast is that it&#039;s an easy meal to eat right.  Because I eat alone for this meal, I can eat disgustingly healthy, organic food.  

Lunch and Dinner are different.  I often eat out or invite people over for the two meals.  Eating healthy food in a social setting is much more difficult.  

So I know that at least one meal I eat daily will be healthy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do seem to wake up too early often.  So it&#039;s tempting to try not to eat breakfast.

But couldn&#039;t that be a bad trade off.  Nutritionally, isn&#039;t breakfast crucial to focus and energy throughout the day?
