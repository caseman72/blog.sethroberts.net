		<description><![CDATA[Hi seth, question on morning sunlight. I have to be to work before sunrise, but i can, if i choose work with the sun shining directly on me through a glass window in the morning.  Do you think this would this give me the same benefit as direct sunlight outside, (it&#039;s a standard house window, no special properties to it)
Thanks]]></description>
