		<description><![CDATA[...and the physical anthropology students look down on the cultural anthropology students (poor archeology students are caught in the middle of that cold war), and the experimental psychologists look down on the clinical psychologists (who think this is ironic), and the UCLA middle campus (biological and social sciences) looks down on the UCLA north campus (humanities and arts), and the south campus (medical school) look down on both middle and north campus. It all reminds me of a funny scene in Stranger in a Strange Land where the Martian protagonist (forgot his name) is trying to figure out why humans laugh (an alien concept and emotion to the Martian--pun intended) until he visits the zoo. He is at the monkey (or was it ape?) enclosure and observes the biggest male walk up do and hit the second biggest male, who then proceeds to go on and hit the third biggest male, and so on down the line. All of a sudden the Martian laughs with a sudden insight into human nature and a major source of all of its comedy. I guess this is why the ancient Greeks linked comedy to tragedy so well.

By the way, REAL artists -- those that ply their craft for a living -- tend not to be like the art students described (at least not in my limited interaction with them). I used to hang out on a regular basis with New York fashion designer Byron Lars and many of his friends and colleagues who designed, illustrated, photographed, etc. Each artist I met, no matter what their niche, not only respected the practitioners of the other niches, but actually utilized them in plying their own craft. Whoever things illustration and fashion are different spheres of art has never met a real fashion designer. Illustration is probably what they do most, more than cutting fabric, I can assure you of that!

I&#039;ve observed that many successful artists and scientists do not where blinders to their own field, but have much broader interests and had more unconventional and highly varied educations and past experiences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Funny, the description of the different majors reminded me of your post of differentiating scientists from engineers.  I bet all the artists look at that rift as similarly comical.

We all want our cognitive shortcuts.  From the time of being a baby, people become successful by copying the successful.  If a photo major has idols to emulate with all the profiles/interviews of famous photographers happening these days they may think that being articulate and opinionated is a big part of being a successful photog.  Similarly, illustrators in industry can be recluses, more child-like, etc.

But above all, everyone in western society wants to be an individual but doesn&#039;t want to fall so far from the tree that they&#039;re alone.  It&#039;s better to be a ___ major than to be that weird guy.]]></description>
