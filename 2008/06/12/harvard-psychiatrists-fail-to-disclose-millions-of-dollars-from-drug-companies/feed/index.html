		<description><![CDATA[I am absolutely astounished, not surprised, but it just makes me sick since I am a BP patient who weaned myself from drugs over 4 years ago!  The fact that they are doing a &quot;study&quot; and promoting these drugs for children is extremely dangerous and UNETHICAL.  As an adult who took them, I can tell you that they can KILL YOU.  Once I weaned myself I did not have the suicidal thoughts that were prevelant while on them!  I can also tell you that fish oil and flax oil have helped stablilize my moods!!!
