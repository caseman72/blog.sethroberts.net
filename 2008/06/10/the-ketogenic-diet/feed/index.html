		<description><![CDATA[Patri, thanks for your comment. I don&#039;t think the film was saying that the doctor was ignorant. The doctor knew about the studies, she just didn&#039;t like them. She didn&#039;t find them convincing. In the film, the doctor showed the mother a comprehensive book about the treatment of epilepsy, the &quot;bible&quot;, and told her that the ketogenic diet wasn&#039;t in the book or according to the book wasn&#039;t an approved treatment. It wasn&#039;t just one doctor who thought the diet was not worth trying. It was also the authors of that book. If the film didn&#039;t present an accurate picture of how the ketogenic diet was viewed by the vast majority of doctors, please let me know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But...but...there is tons of evidence for the ketogenic diet, including plenty of controlled studies.  It&#039;s hard to blind the diet, but it&#039;s not like this hasn&#039;t been studied.

When I started eating low-carb 6 or 7 years ago, and I looked into research on the safety of being in ketosis, most of what I found was studies of ketogenic diets to reduce epilepsy in children.  So I&#039;d say the problem here is that this doctor is ignorant, not that the whole system is wrong.]]></description>
