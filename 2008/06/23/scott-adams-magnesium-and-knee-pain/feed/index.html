		<description><![CDATA[I have torn miniscus, torn tissue behind my right and left knees.  The right is the worst.  Surgery is scheduled for late January 2010.  I want to know how much magnesium do I need to take.  What is an elliptical exercise machine?  I certainly can not do any squats at this time; I am a person that walked, rides a bike, exercise and roller skates.  I can do barely nothing now.

Can someone steer me in the right direction?  Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for all the information on how magnesium has helped each of you. 

I also have alot of pain in my knees one I&#039;ve had surgery on recently. So my question is how much magnesium does one need? 

All your information has been so helpful. Looking forward to trying it myself. Especially something natural.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have had pain in my medial part of my knee for seven years. Knew exercise would help so I decided to use the elliptical machine since it hurt the least doing that exercise. Every day for four and a half weeks I was on that machine for 30 minutes to an hour everyday. Somewhere along the line the pain went away. I now do swats again with no pain. I can also play basketball without the pain I had before. I did not do any special pills or vitamins just the elliptical machine everyday. No longer do I get out of bed and feel that pain in the knee that I did for so many years especially after exercise. I also did leg stretches before and after which you should be doing anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this! Most of my (very longstanding) knee pain has gone away and my knees are much more flexible since I started supplementing with magnesium 5 or 6 months ago.  It never occurred to me that it was due to the magnesium since I had started taking it when I made a lot of changes switching from SLD to SLD plus low-carb.  Mineral supplements are advised when on low-carb because of the diuretic effect of low-carb.  I had assumed the reduction in my knee pain was the result of weight loss together with some positive effect of not consuming grains. It&#039;s funny if it&#039;s just the magnesium.  Maybe someday I&#039;ll know for sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s fascinating. My knees also hurt after exercise and I have mild alergies. I also often have &quot;restless legs&quot; when trying to sleep, which a commenter at Scott&#039;s blog reports are ameliorated by taking magnesium supplements. (All these conditions are mild and I haven&#039;t been actively looking to fix them.) I&#039;ll try magnesium supplements starting tomorrow and report back in a few weeks. It may be just confirmation bias etc.

But here&#039;s the really fascinating thing. I just checked which foods are high in magnesium and this list has a surprisingly large overlap with my list of favourite foods. Did my tastes adjust in order for my body to get more magnesium? This suggests the following conjecture:

To identify which nutrients you might be chronically deficient in, look at which nutrients are present in higher-than-normal amounts in your favourite foods. 

Does anyone have evidence to support/reject this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On a random, yet related note:  I suffered a sports career ending knee injury as a younger man.  A few years ago, against my doctor&#039;s and others&#039; advice, I began doing barbell squats, in a matter of months my knee felt an order of magnitude better and I no longer experienced pain upon strong twisting/lateral type movements. I later learned from some olympic lifters, that squats (done properly) are excellent for rehabbing knees suffering from damage to the ligaments/tendons.]]></description>
