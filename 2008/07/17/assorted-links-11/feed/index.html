		<description><![CDATA[Great links, thanks!

I particularly liked the talk by Sam Gosling, and ordered his book. Some interesting insights.

He says that you can&#039;t get much information about someone from one observation, that you need to put together a number of data points. This reminds me of gene analysis, where knowing one alelle for an individual doesn&#039;t give you much information, but from 100 alleles you can make a number of predictions with high probability of being right.

I don&#039;t agree with Gosling&#039;s conclusion that some people are inherently messy, even though they want to be neat and organized. My experience is that a lot of being organized comes from training and learning good techniques: I know my life was changed by two books, Marla Cilley&#039;s Sink Reflections and David Allen&#039;s Getting Things Done. Allen&#039;s rule is to do things that take less than 2 minutes right now, instead of putting them off. Just following this one rule makes a dramatic difference, and it isn&#039;t hard to do.]]></description>
