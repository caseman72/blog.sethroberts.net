		<description><![CDATA[hm, costume manufacturers would certainly be up a creek if they didn&#039;t have halloween, and people talk about hallmark holidays created to sell cards, so that makes intuitive sense.

i guess another idea that leaps to mind is that holidays are a time when people are more likely to be focusing on a certain seemingly culturally valuable narratives or sets of ideas.

i&#039;m reminded of how muslims have to pray five times a day and have ramadan once a lunar year presumably effectively reminding them of their muslim values.

with the fourth of july there&#039;s a nice overlap of the commercial ends of holiday&#039;s and the end of reminding people of american values, given american free-market friendliness.  :)]]></description>
