		<description><![CDATA[I was introduced to picture phones at RIT in 1972.  The idea was for deaf students and teachers to use the system.  However, it became apparent that seeing each other talk opened a channel of human relationship.
I hope this becomes packaged so I can use it with my aging parents.

		<description><![CDATA[what a fantastic idea! I wonder if that would help pets too. Highly social, intelligent birds like parrots (left home alone all day) would probably really dig it, and maybe dogs with separation anxiety, too. Cats wouldn&#039;t care -- as a cat owner I&#039;m pretty sure of this ;) Although I have thought of setting up a cam so I can see what THEY do all day.]]></description>
