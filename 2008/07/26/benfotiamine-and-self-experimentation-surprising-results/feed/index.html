		<description><![CDATA[The b vitamins supposedly work together.  It would probably be a good idea to also take a b complex with the benfotiamine.  I probably have a deficiency, but I am taking benfotiamine a b complex several times a day, and my energy is up and my pants size is down.  

Also go by your belt size, not the scales.  It could be that the benfotiamine is making you more muscular.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for explaining that. My flaxseed oil results, and Tim&#039;s, have a very simple explanation: We don&#039;t eat nearly enough omega-3. There&#039;s no reason to think diabetics need less omega-3 than non-diabetics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t know how a diabetic metabolizes DHA, but i know that it&#039;s a serious condition that could skew the results.  my sense is that this feature of a study would be criticized by reviewers.   (altho i recognize that your experience tends to be consistent with his).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mr. Lundeen appears to have a mild case of diabetic neuropathy.  This would seem to call into question the validity of his prior findings relative to consuming DHA. (What would work in  a diabetic might not work or work as well in an individual w/o that condition).  He also might consider checking out Sangamo BioSciences, Inc.  treatment for this condition, currently in phase II; perhaps he could enroll in the phase III, which is scheduled to commence next year (although his condition may not be severe enough).]]></description>
