		<description><![CDATA[re dental malocclusion:  straight teeth in less industrial society probably results from lengthy breastfeeding as a child.  I had an orthodontist who insisted that prolonged sucking on the roof of the mouth pulls the structure down a bit (with the nose as well) and that the lowering of this arched structure would push the sides of the arch outwards.  So the jaws would become wider.  He also contended that over time the arch narrows, the roof of the mouth moves up, the nose protrudes more, nasal cavity space is decreased and tmj problems may result.  Certainly I have noticed that protruding noses and narrow faces go together.  Perhaps sucking hard on marrow bones (or other difficult to extract foods ) would counter this effect of aging and/or the industrial world diet.  I would love to know what you think!

The Kitava Study is an interesting example of recent research similar to Dr. Price&#039;s. You can Google &quot;Kitava Study&quot; or paste http://paleodiet.com/lindeberg/ into your browser.

		<description><![CDATA[Based on Taubes&#039;s recommendation, I picked up the book from Amazon, and read it cover-to-cover. It&#039;s worth doing so to get the full message, and Price&#039;s support for his arguments.

While there seems to be some disagreement as to the influence of nutrition on facial structure, it&#039;s awfully hard to argue with the pictures of generations and see the changes over time as their nutrition changes from a traditional diet to a westernized (Processed carbohydrates-based) diet.

In particular the repeated pattern of no tooth decay on traditional diets vs. increasing tooth decay on western diets was a revelation. We have accepted tooth decay as normal and natural, but it appears it isn&#039;t at all.

Disgusting as it may sound, I almost never brushed my teeth growing up. Maybe 2-3 times a year. But I never had bad breath, and I never had a cavity until I was in my 20s. Not one. And I ate lots of sugar and was overweight. The rest of the family had plenty of cavities. The only difference is that in my early 20s, I stopped drinking milk. Up until that time I was drinking upwards of a half gallon a day. When I stopped, I started to get cavities. Not many, but it went from zero to a few within a few years. Price would have understood this immediately.

This kind of study is probably impossible at this point in history. When Price and his wife were traveling in the early 30s, transportation and the degree of modernization was such that there were still genetically-identical populations that could be separated by only a short distance, and where one of the group might be eating a traditional diet and the other a westernized diet, so you could reasonably and easily compare the two. that isn&#039;t the case anymore I don&#039;t think.]]></description>
