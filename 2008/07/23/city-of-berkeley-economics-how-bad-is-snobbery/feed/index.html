		<description><![CDATA[I may have written of this in a prior comment. One reason Berkeley business may be struggling is the fact the City gives out tickets for not having a front license plate ($25 fine).  I received one in front of the Newman Center a few months ago while attending a funeral.  I understand if the meter person is already writing a me a parking ticket but my meter still had time on it when I got back to the car.  Basically, the meter person was looking for cars with no license plates as a revenue stream for the city.  When I sent my payment in for the fine, I sent a letter and copied Peet&#039;s coincidently enough as we were planning on getting coffee after the funeral. The letter stated instead of shopping in Berkeley waiting for the reception, we got out of there.  I love Berkeley but I will never go into the city again if I do not have to (or to attend a football game).
