		<description><![CDATA[Hm, it seems like there&#039;s a trend of expansion and contraction.  People start off developing marketable ideas as autotelic hobbies, then they or someone else popularizes their product, and then the market evolves such that new hobbies can be supported, refining what exists.  Someone who&#039;s interested in plants discovered the drug-element of marijuana (or coffee to reference your previous post), a subculture develops of enthusiastic hobbiests, then the drug gets popularized and mass-produced, and then a demand for a more refined form of the product develops and new hobbiests breed newer forms of the drug.  Are we, through this process, becoming more and more refined aesthetes?]]></description>
