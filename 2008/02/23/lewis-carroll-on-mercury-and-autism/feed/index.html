		<description><![CDATA[You are a human being. 
You are not a person, you â€œhaveâ€ a person.
A person is your agent in commerce,. A fictitious entity to which rights and duties are ascribed.
To the government and industrialists you are an indentured slave or as the media refers to us, â€œconsumersâ€.
Before you enter into the world arena let alone the Austim arena you must see where, as an individual, you stand.
Here in Ontario Canada there are over 1000 citizen children on a shameful waitlist to receive funding for ABA/IBI therapies. Time is their enemy. After four years and the Senate / Eggleton paper â€œPay Now or Pay Laterâ€ and the Canadian National Autism Strategy lies dormant. (Although it is a good document , worth reading)
Canada is founded upon the principles that recognize the Supremecy of God and the Rule of Law.
Both of which are being broken by the Canadian governments both Federal and Provincial.
The Magna Carta, the British North American Act, The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the U.S. Constitution were all written to protect us from the Sovereign.

To all of us parents in the front lines all over the world â€œHallelujah to Ya !
At the end of the day itâ€™s just us, our little team and the clinic we run from our homes.

Why is the focus always only on thimerosal?â€¨Included on this list of chemical concerns should also be formaldehyde, M.S.G., aluminum, Butylated hydroxytoluene or B.H.T. and many others.â€¨Donâ€™t let the mainstream media and pharma spin doctors lull you into only focusing on the thimerosal.â€¨Remember these corporations would no doubt lose everything if a connection is made between the preservatives and the world wide vaccine programs.â€¨
Our great grandparents our grandparents and our parents were all infected with toxic preservatives through the inoculation programs. 
I saw my 5yr old sonâ€™s live blood analysis taking place.â€¨I saw live candida yeast in his blood.â€¨I saw the heavy metals as well.â€¨Where do you think it came from?â€¨Leaky gut syndrome comes from the M.M.R jab.â€¨
We saw the change in our child right after the second round of vaccinations.â€¨
Freedom of the person requires not only, or not even especially, the absence of legal constraints but the presence of alternative thoughts. The most successful tyranny is not the one that uses force to assure uniformity, but the one that removes awareness of other possibilities.â€¨I have come to the conclusion that those who benefit from any societal mechanism rarely wish to understand that mechanism, especially if it appears to grant them power or authority and understanding it or any alternatives would restrict, diminish or destroy that power apparently granted.â€¨They live in a vapid world of learned assumptions.â€¨Lets face it if you have acronyms after your name your whole goal is to get published and funded no matter how ridiculous your position is.â€¨Most if not all of the researchers and their research are in the pocket of Big Pharma. They have lobbied their way into the core of our societies. I feel sorry for the caregivers who actually administer the jab and wonder how they are going to live with themselves after the truth comes out.
If we put up with this our children will be next.
Itâ€™s not the vaccines itâ€™s the toxins therein.
A child on the spectrum is born every 20 minutes. What do they all have in common?
Wake up people.]]></description>
