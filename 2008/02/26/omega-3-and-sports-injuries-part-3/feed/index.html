		<description><![CDATA[Seth .. this may be a strange question, but Im wondering how your hair is doing? 
Ive experimented with flaxseed oil myself, but I noticed my hair got thinner as a result of using flax-oil.
On the net I also found alot of reactions from people who also experienced hairloss because of flaxseed oil. 
Thanks for your reaction]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suspect the idea of biochemical individuality will never be proven. I&#039;m reminded of the popularity of &quot;Eat Right for Your Type&quot; several years ago. Both seem plausible but a long way from truth and of course, not testable as a hypothesis.
What should be recognized, however, is that the body is a complex system, its output expressed by the myriad rules that govern it and the initial conditions. Different initial conditions yield different results.
When it comes to the efficacy of omega 3 we can not isolate the daily dose of fish oil/flax seed from our current and past diets (omega 6: omega 3 intake; types of omega 3 - ALA, DHA or EPA; low-fat Vs low-carb; saturated fat: MUFA/PUFA; other supplements that may work for or against omega 3, etc.) and your physical &amp; psychological environments (high intensity Vs endurance exercise; how you manage stress). The permutation is endless with endless possibilities without ever resorting to biochemical individuality as an explanation. 
Self experimentation may be the only way to settle some hard cases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Charles, I agree, biochemical individuality is one big reason self-experimentation is important. So you can figure out what works for you.

Self-experimentation is a bit like the two sides of a bridge, the on ramp and the off ramp. Self-experimentation (on ramp) will often be the only way to come up with a new idea worth testing conventionally. And even after this or that treatment is shown to work via conventional research (bridge), individuals will still need to use self-experimentation (off ramp) to make sure it is working for them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As per Roger Williams&#039;s &quot;Biochemical Individuality,&quot; there is an incredibly wide range of responses to everything, including nutrients.

Having owned a health food store for a lot of years, it was obvious to me that some things were miraculous for some people, neutral for others, and harmful to another group.

That&#039;s why Seth&#039;s approach is so important. It&#039;s all about experimentation and learning what things to to your body, and learning how to be objective about that (as far as that&#039;s possible).

I was taking flax seed oil at one point for weight loss, and then I realized that it was improving my mood. Unfortunately I didn&#039;t trust that observation (about fatty acids) until years later, when it was validated by reading some studies about fatty acids and the brain. So again, Seth&#039;s approach to all these things, and the rigor with which he approaches them, is something to emulate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Any way to find out what type of flax oil Anonymous is taking?  I&#039;m curious about the lignan content comments from other posts which suggested lignans might be a source of nauesea, and wondering whether they may have other effects on the benefits, or lack thereof, of flax.  I&#039;ve always taken flax with lignans and haven&#039;t experienced such benefits.]]></description>
