		<description><![CDATA[[...] July 10, 2009 by jason    After reading a lot of Charles Bukowski&#8217;s writing, I&#8217;ve lost interest in reading a lot of other authors.

Â This reminds me of something that Seth Roberts wrote about: Before last night I had heard of Amy Winehouse and I had heard Rehab, but hadnâ€™t put the two together. Her Grammy performance blew me away. I watched a bunch of YouTubes of her. Back at the Grammys, I listened to an orchestra play Rhapsody in Blue. I used to like it; now it sounded awful. I listened to a few more group performances; they too sounded bad. Just as The Joy of Sake had made me no longer enjoy cheap sake, listening to a lot of Amy Winehouse had made me no longer enjoy â€œaverageâ€ music â€” music where several individual performances are combined.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Orchestras are Mediocristan, I realized; individual singers are Extremistan. In art, emotional impact is everything. Extremistan allows really big impact; Mediocristan does not. Maybe this is why classical music is dying.&quot;

This is the opposite for me. After developing my ear to better understand classical music, most of the pop I grew up on seemed like a distance echo of really emotional music. Second, to equate &quot;classical&quot; music with orchestral music seems puzzling.

There is probably more classical music being produced now than at any time before, and classical music has spread to large parts of Asia. I&#039;d be interested in data which suggest that classical music is dying, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re absolutely right.  It&#039;s always bothered me that that egotistical composer only had the same impact as the 5th chair, first seat second violin.  And when it&#039;s a piece for solo piano?  Each of the 88 notes can&#039;t stand above any of the others.  Those damn classical musicians may as well be communists, but that&#039;s why they&#039;re all dying, so it&#039;ll be all good soon enough anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post!

I normally listen to popular music and like Amy Winehouse a lot, but recently found a classical piece that I love, Dvorak&#039;s Stabat Mater by Shaw (http://www.amazon.com/Dvorak-Stabat-Goerke-Simpson-Atlanta/dp/B00001QGKI/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1202863660&amp;sr=8-1). Extrimistan for the orchestra and chorus. (Not really fair, because there are a lot of solos, but see what you think.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this post makes me think of the auteur theory of film.  it seems like auteur films are better than the average film.  one guy has a strong vision that is followed, versus a film made by a lot of collaboration by many--writers, director, actors.  maybe this is the difference between extremistan and mediocristan.  of course, there are good non-auteur films!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep, I agree.  

An average burger is totally edible and okay.  Sure, it is not a Father&#039;s Office burger.  (If you haven&#039;t had one, demolish one ASAP)  But &#039;average&#039; sushi is just horrible.  (My friends think I am an intentional-snob-elitist-bastard, but I swear I am not.)  

Like you say Seth, sushi could be Extremistan where the mean and median are entirely meaningless, and the distribution is characterized by the extremes at either tail.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I think Japanese cuisine really needs to be good.  American cuisine, not so much.  A mediocre cheeseburger with mediocre fries is a filling lunch and we won&#039;t even notice there&#039;s anything wrong.

But sushi, for example, is different.  Very few people have ever had good sushi.  Living in a city with a large Japanese community, I&#039;ve had the opportunity to do so.  Result: I rarely eat sushi now.  And even though there are at least a dozen sushi places in my immediate neighborhood, I will get on the highway and drive for half an hour to the place I know is good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

Same exact thing happened to me with fish.  After I started free-diving in Southern California, shooting fish (White Sea Bass, Halibut Yellowtail, and the occasional Calico Bass) as well as gathering Scallops and Lobster and then eating them literally within hours --- eating fish at a restaurant, even a 5-star restaurant on a corporate expense account...seemed to be nothing but a brutal exercise in futility.  I quickly realized even the best restaurants in the world cannot get fish of the same quality as my friends and I could on a good day in the water.  (BTW my friends don&#039;t like to believe me, but it is true.  None of my spearfishing buddies ever order fish at a restaurant unless it really doesn&#039;t matter e.g. Baja fish taco)  And my sushi intake also slackened dramatically.  Great fish ruined me forever for anything less than the absolute freshest and best.    

To this day, I never eat fish in a restaurant b/c I know it will be un-fresh and most often overdone.  I usually opt for the steak cuz I haven&#039;t figured out how to slaughter a cow at home.   :)  And a steak can benefit from aging.]]></description>
