		<description><![CDATA[Hi Spacenookie,
Taubes discusses the anticipatory release of insulin resulting from thoughts about food, or exposure to the smell of food, in the last or second-to-last chapter of his book. I just finished reading the tome last night, so this section is still quite vivid in my mind.
Now that I&#039;ve finished the book (one of the best books I&#039;ve read in my lifetime -- ever!), I am going to re-read Seth&#039;s interview with Taubes. Btw, I&#039;ve haven&#039;t done the SLD diet in quite a while (I&#039;m 5&#039;11&quot; and 142 lbs., an ideal weight for my height), but I&#039;ve been cutting way back on carbs and increasing my intake of protein and fats, especially red meat, eggs, whole milk, and cheese. I also take 2400 mg of fish oil in capsule form daily. I can honestly say I&#039;ve never felt better both physically AND mentally in my whole life. I just had a dentist visit two days ago and the dentist was impressed at how good my oral health was. I used to suffer have one or two cavities filled almost every year, and my gums always had swelling. My gums are doing much better and I haven&#039;t had a cavity in almost two years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Exaggerating the caloric content seems like a &lt;a href=&#039;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UsefulLie&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Useful Lie&lt;/a&gt;, if the goal is to learn to like a food. Now how can I get my wife to like veggies? :)  (This is a social engineering problem, she has an aversion to things that taste &quot;green&quot;)

http://www.keepkidshealthy.com/nutrition/kids_vegetables.html says - &quot;What if you didn&#039;t teach your toddler to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables? Is it too late? Probably.&quot;

The old trick of mixing veggies in with calorie-rich companions seems like it should not work if taste sensitivities are ultraspecific-

&quot;Creative ways to get your kids to eat more vegetables can include camouflaging them in with other foods, like chopping up and mixing vegetables in with pasta sauces, lasagna, casseroles, soup, chili, omelets, etc. or adding veggie toppings to pizza. You can even find recipes for things like banana raisin pancakes, carrot beef meatballs or zucchini cookies, that your kids might enjoy.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[somewhere in the Taubes tome, Taubes talks about insulin release in *anticipation* of eating.  He says that if you think about eating, there is an initial release of insulin that precedes consumption and then a later release after consumption.  I wonder if the initial release could be a learned effect based on what types of food you expect to eat.  Taubes argues strongly that if you don&#039;t have insulin in your system, you can&#039;t gain or maintain fat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeff, yes additional calories should strengthen the association. 

as for your &quot;anything wrong?&quot; question I don&#039;t think I understand what might be &quot;wrong&quot;.

in these experiments I will probably try flavorless calories -- e.g., eating plain bread with my nose closed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Seth-
 I meant to reply to your original brandy post, but see you&#039;re expanding on this (th/m)eme.
 Would the association be accelerated if you took flavorless calories along with the flavor? (Flax capsules, totally flavorless).  Anything wrong with exaggerating the association in this way?
