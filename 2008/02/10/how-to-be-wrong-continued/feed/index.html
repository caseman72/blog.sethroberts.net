		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I made very clear how this tendency is a problem, giving the analogy of a car that could turn left but not right. Obviously bad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There were a lotta cars in Daytona Beach this past week that could only turn left.  Ryan Newman won $1.6 million with one of those cars.  Which is a lot more than &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; car ever made &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>

Something about not having players on your bench unless you&#039;re willing to send them up to bat (or to pitch).

But Weaver didn&#039;t do much &quot;nurturing,&quot; at least not how that term is generally construed.]]></description>
