		<description><![CDATA[Socktopi, yeah, something like that. In The Shangri-La Diet (the book) I mention a &quot;culture of connoisseurship&quot; as a likely reason the French weigh less than you&#039;d expect.

August, you can weaken a flavor-calorie association if you experience the flavor without the calories. Randomly varying the calories won&#039;t do it. I think Tim Beneke has tried the flavor-no-calorie approach. He tastes the food and then spits it out. If I remember correctly, it works: the flavor becomes less pleasant.

		<description><![CDATA[What about an attempt to de-associate a flavor with it&#039;s calories?  It seems to me you could use nose-clipping to add calories to any flavor, thus causing the flavor/calorie association to be adjusted.  If the body kept getting random levels of calories for a particular flavor, wouldn&#039;t the flavor/calorie association be weakened?]]></description>
