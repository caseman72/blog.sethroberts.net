		<description><![CDATA[[...] 1, 2010 &#183; Leave a Comment  I just attended a talk by a very famous quantitative psychologist. It was a good talk, all aboutmodeling some fairly fine aspects of the interactions between information and reward in a decision-making paradigm, and there was a lot of mathematics in it that will forever elude me. Since I don&#8217;t do this kind of work and am not well-equipped to understand it, I am probably undersensitive to how hard it is. Owing in part to these deficiencies, I&#8217;ve always appreciated Seth Roberts and Hal Pashler&#8217;s points about model-fitting (here&#8217;s a relevant post from Seth&#8217;s blog, referencing a classmate of mine from a neural networks course), and in particular the point that fitting a lot of data with a few free parameters isn&#8217;t always the coup it seems to be. I think there&#8217;s an issue of denying the antecedent at work. Everyone knows that, if your observations aren&#8217;t much more numerous than your parameters, a model fit is unimpressive; the easy inference is that, if your observations are much more numerous than your parameters, a model fit is impressive. But that&#8217;s invalid and, more to the point, not always true. Roberts and Pashler bring up the point that &#8220;psychological data is often not surprising&#8221;; in many situations, including the ones addressed in this talk, it&#8217;s predictable that the data will take the form of, say, a logistic function. (In fact, I&#8217;d guess that psychologists tend to prefer experiments that can be easily modeled by simple functions.) If there&#8217;s a strong prior for a logistic function, the fact that you can fit a lot of data with a couple of parameters is not impressive; all it shows is that you know how to fit a logistic function.
