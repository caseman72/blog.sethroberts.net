		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve worn the same contact lenses for three years.  The previous pair lasted ten years.  (Hard lenses; the &quot;gas permeable&quot; technology has been perfected.)  It&#039;s obvious why lens manufacturers promote disposable lenses, but it should be just as obvious why we&#039;re better off resisting them, even if you neglect (appalling) infection rates.

My last optician, at a mall chain store, did suggest using two different strengths of lens, as an alternative to lenses and also reading glasses.  She also offered two weak lenses, tuned for reading, along with driving glasses.  What I&#039;m using is two strong lenses along with reading glasses.  I find myself wearing the glasses most of the day.  The advantage of reading glasses is that they&#039;re cheap.  I go through two pair a year. Of course they&#039;re all made in China.]]></description>

Until the research showed that any blurry image on the retina spurred growth (worsening the outcome continuously).  So, not a great idea for everyone.]]></description>
