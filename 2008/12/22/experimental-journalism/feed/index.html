I&#039;m sure cops would immediately make it irrelevant by heavily ticketing those areas that took the longest to continue to use uncertainty as a deterrent. Of course, that would also make a decent follow up piece.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What would have been interesting is had they segmented out the experiment via target demographic.  I suspect that the Nesquik stuff would have crushed Momofuku in Nesquik&#039;s demo i.e. five to 10 year olds.  

I also wonder if (I forgot the proper name for this phenomenon) the fact that liking cheap-y foods is just not cool*, especially not amongst New York Mag readers, skewed the reporting of their preferences.  That is to say, there is something nostalgic about the sickly sweet, artificially colored milk.

*For the record, McDonald&#039;s pulls a great coke, and their fries are simply unbeatable.  I don&#039;t care how sweet potato gastro-pub you wanna get....
