		<description><![CDATA[Was there a difference between black tea or milk added to tea? Also green tea? What tea was used in the test?

Also red or white wine?

You can draw any conclusion from any data if you want it hard enough and care little enough about actual science. This study shows correlation but you&#039;ve fabricated causation on top of it.]]></description>
