		<description><![CDATA[Is physics really 100% science?  Up until, say, 1980, it was close.  How about modern physics, which is to say string theory?  It&#039;s hard to say if there&#039;s any science there at all. There&#039;s still plenty of physics to be elucidated, e.g. in the realms of plasma and solid states, but not many people are working on these.  The mathematics are unpleasantly messy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FA Hayek made a very similar point in The Constitution of Liberty. Over the generations, the original reasons (which may not have even been the &quot;correct&quot; ones) for a traditional practice are often forgotten.
