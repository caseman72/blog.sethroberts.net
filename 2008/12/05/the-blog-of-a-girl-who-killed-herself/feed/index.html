If you hate your job, it might be a source of a lot of stress for you - and it might make sense to instead find something that you love doing, where you can also make money at it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[interesting you put this post.  i actually had thought of attempting suicide last monday because i hate my job at uc berkeley and i don&#039;t want to work.  can you believe it?  everytime i come across suicidal ideation i tell people and nobody does nothing.  i just never tell my therapist when i feel this way because he&#039;ll put me in the hospital!  and then i&#039;ll end up in the psych dept at my regular hospital and have to face all the doctors and psychologists and nurses who had seen me doing so well in the past.  i can&#039;t face them when i had been doing so well and then all of a sudden want to hurt myself.  i would feel so embarrassed...

once when i wanted to hurt myself, i went to boston university er and the nurse sent me back out and said, &quot;you&#039;re not gonna drown in the charles river, it&#039;s frozen.&quot;  (it was winter and i was new in town and i wanted to commit suicide by falling into the charles, a river next to MIT)

although i&#039;ve seen some of the best doctors and know some wonderful psychologists and lcsw, i&#039;ve never once gotten a convincing answer to my question:  why should i not kill myself?  

i&#039;m not suicidal anymore, but like my anxiety, the desire to hurt myself always comes back.  it has haunted me for 10 years now....

i don&#039;t mean to offend anyone, but this blog entry you wrote, seth, does not seem sad to me....]]></description>
