		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sure there&#039;s much that can be disputed in Gladwell&#039;s books. But to claim, as the Gladwell Critique does, that the message of the newly published Outliers is simply that genius takes hard work is a ridiculous distortion. The thesis of the book is rather that success has much less to do with individual merit--understood as natural talent or ability plus hard work--than we generally like to believe, and much more with to do with factors external to the individual: parental upbringing, culture, random opportunity, and arbitrary advantages. This is not a trivial claim, and it is well worth discussing, especially in America. I can&#039;t say now whether Gladwell accurately reports all the social science he relies on, but I found Outliers a very thought-provoking book. (See also his related piece in the current New Yorker.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I lived in London, I concluded that British envy is different from American envy.  An American might say, &quot;I&#039;m every bit as good as him -- I deserve a promotion!&quot;  The Brit will say, &quot;He&#039;s no smarter than I am -- he should be demoted!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had a conversation about Jane Jacobs with professor emeritus Michael B. Teitz, at Berkeley. It must have been a twenty minute conversation and I am  interested in reading more about Jane Jacobs. Seth, how come you like Jane Jacobs so much? I remember the day when Seth gave a book talk in San Francisco, at Stacey&#039;s bookstore.  On his blog, he mentioned that he had wanted a book by Jane Jacobs.  But after the talk when he wanted to buy it, the book was gone!  I learn a lot of stuff on this blog that help me talk with other professors at UC Berkeley.  I like how your mind works, Seth.]]></description>
