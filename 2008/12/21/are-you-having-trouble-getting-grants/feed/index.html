		<description><![CDATA[[...] Seth Roberts on how grants might corrupt researchers, and the benefits of self experimentation. My comment there: i guess business people might fund some experimentation in order to actually get a working g product they could sell. a problem there is if you’re working to find out something so you can sell it then you might not care to share your findings because that would be a trade secret. i guess you want to be rewarded for your findings, but at the same time, there seems like there could be a problem of useful findings being held by only a few due to their interests.

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Cheap-skate self-experimenter Seth Robert&#8217;s shouldn&#8217;t be worried about getting grants, but he&#8217;s talking about them anyway here. Apparently even in these belt-tightening times there&#8217;s still money to be had. What I find interesting about the post is his use of Jane Jacob&#8217;s two moralities from Systems of Survival: the taking (aka guardian) based on loyalty and the trading based on honesty. Seth thinks that reliance on grants will make scientists more concerned with loyalty than honesty and afraid to publish results that Seth (who ain&#8217;t afraid of no McCloskey) wouldn&#8217;t think twice about.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Science should value honesty, of course; but you can see that a dependence on grants pushes everyone involved toward a loyalty-based morality: If we tell the truth we might lose our grant. Modern science is indeed almost completely dependent on grants, which means results donâ€™t really matter. What really matters is getting the next grant.&lt;/i&gt;

Beautifully well-put and accurate.  One thing you could have fleshed out a bit further is that such systems go hand-in-hand with groupthink orthodoxy.  

Now, let&#039;s put this observation into context.  To wit, there is much more money to be &#039;made&#039; in promoting &#039;global warming&#039;, than disputing.  Therefore, a Popperian approach to proving global warming exists will never be funded.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that makes sense.  i think my main concern is slightly different--proprietary information--a hypothetical: you might have asked people to sign a non-disclosure agreement so they wouldn&#039;t talk about your shangri-la diet, then disclosed to them the diet for a price.  you could have given the diet away for free to some people who signed a non-disclosure agreement for the sake of getting testimonials, and have a money-back policy to show you believe in your product.  but if this happened, the scientific community might be shut out of learning the new insights, or slowed down in discovering them, possibly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben, some of my info comes from a talk Jacobs gave about these ideas before she published the book. The talk was more straightforward -- you could even say blunt -- than the book. In the talk, the taking/trading distinction is very clear, less so in the book

Mike, honesty is important in business because it is important that people fulfill contracts: accurately describe what they are offering to trade and do what they say they are going to do (e.g., after being given money, hand over the product). Without honesty in that domain, transaction costs become high, mistrust sets in, and the whole trading system breaks down. I think something like that is the explanation for what Jacobs observed. I think Jacobs said something to that effect.]]></description>
