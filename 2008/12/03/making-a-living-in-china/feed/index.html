		<description><![CDATA[when i was homeless in san francisco,  i wanted to get into the sex business.  i had contemplated being a prostitute and the prostitute i met in san francisco became a really good friend of mine.  I met her several times while she was walking the streets and she told me how to get into her line of work.  but i was afraid because it was illegal, but if it was a legal &quot;job,&quot; i think i would have tried it.  i met a &quot;madame&quot; who wanted me to join her group of girls.  i met the madame when i was homeless at the lark inn, a homeless shelter for young adults in san francisco.  
 
what i am trying to say is that maybe it seems sad to you, but  maybe if you talked with the lady, you would think otherwise.  maybe she has a good reason to be a prostitute and call herself &quot;Qikuaiban.&quot;  Before I left san francisco to travel to boston, i almost learned how to be a stripper!  being homeless in san francisco is one of my best memories....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I met a prostitute on the streets of San Francisco many years ago and she was very interesting to talk with.  She told me a lot about her life.  She told me to buy clothes at this one store called &quot;Hong Kong Fashions.&quot;  She told me the clothes there are for ladies and are in style. That is where she buys her clothes. I&#039;ve been shopping there for 4 years! I always get great compliments on my clothes from Hong Kong Fashions, but it is expensive there.  I believe it is worth it, though.  The sales lady there always remembers me.]]></description>
