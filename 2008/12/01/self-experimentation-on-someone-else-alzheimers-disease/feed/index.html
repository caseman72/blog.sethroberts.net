		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if having taken flaxseed oil regularly actually interferes with correct nerve function, such that it is restored immediately but only temporarily after a dose. This would correspond to an addiction / withdrawl response.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s likely, but it seems possible, and easy enough to check.  To check, you would have to find somebody not taking it and measure them, and then measure immediately after the first dose, and again after they&#039;ve been taking it for a while, to see what the correct baseline is.  Right?]]></description>
