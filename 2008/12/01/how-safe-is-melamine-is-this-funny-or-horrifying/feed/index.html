		<description><![CDATA[It stands to reason that there is some level of melamine that is safe. For instance, one molecule per lifetime is probably safe. Two is probably safe. And how many babies have died? Six, the Chinese say. So let&#039;s say it&#039;s really 60. And let&#039;s say that 6,000 received some meaningful injury of some sort that will manifest itself in the future. No, let&#039;s make that 60,000. How many babies drank the milk? Probably 60 million. So the conclusion is that only 1 in 1,000 babies was harmed by the melamine in Chinese milk. So there is in fact a safe level, and it seems to be way more than 2 molecules per lifetime.

I like the fact that the FDA is coming up with some number, however much of a guesstimate it is. The alternative is to give activists ammunition to make unreasonable demands to make the milk 100.0000 percent free of anything that might speculatively shorten your life by 1 second.

This is kind of a pet peeve of mine because of mercury-in-fish activism by ocean conservationists. As a resident of Japan it is bumblebees-can-fly clear that eating an order of magnitude more fish than anyone ever eats in the U.S. is not harmful (and you should probably be reaching the same conclusion in China by now). Yet the FDA&#039;s previous screwup in pulling a low methyl mercury number out of a hat has caused fish eaters/sellers no end of problems and has scared the public away from eating a very beneficial food in favor of manufactured soyburgers.

[Exercise left to the student: Try to follow up on Genevieve&#039;s source in the previous comment. You&#039;ll learn a lot about activist misinformation tactics.]]]></description>
