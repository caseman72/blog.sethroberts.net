		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I decided to give one legged standing a try today because I would very much like to improve my own sleep patterns- particularly getting deep sleep and feeling well rested the next morning.  I would rank my quality of sleep at about a 70 at best on the scale of 0-100 even though I exercise 6 days a week and do meditation &amp; yoga intermittently. There is usually a residual, lingering tiredness throughout the day.  I have been trying to achieve better sleep in the last few months by weaning myself off caffeine.  (Apparently caffeine prohibits you from reaching S4 sleep levels among other things)  I have noticed a definite improvement in the quality of my sleep whenever I cut back (but not yet eliminating) my daily caffeine intake.  If I increase coffee dosage from 12 oz to 16 oz or 24 oz my sleep will suffer no matter what time of day I drink it...I&#039;ve never seen you mention caffeine intake in any of your posts- do you consume caffeine daily &#039;like approximately 90% of Americans&#039;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, your theories are fascinating- I am now trying out the Shangri-la diet (found out via Freakonomics). If I can prove to myself that the diet works then I will eagerly move on to your other ideas (Standing, Faces early in the morning, etc). Really cool, really original &amp; bold stuff...keep up the good work.
