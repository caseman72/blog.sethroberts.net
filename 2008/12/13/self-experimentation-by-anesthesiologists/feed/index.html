		<description><![CDATA[I sat next to an anesthesiologist on a long flight, once.  His advice was, if you ever need general anesthesia, ask for &lt;i&gt;adenosine&lt;/i&gt;.  Its effects completely dissipate in seven seconds, leaving no hint of dopiness behind.  (But be sure the surgeon sprinkles in lots of lidocaine while stitching up!)

He related a story about his teacher, who had been an insufficiently-trained medic in the Japanese Army, ordered to administer adenosine for an operation, but used a little too much.  The patient&#039;s heart stopped, and he fainted.  When he woke up, a few seconds later, the surgeon had noticed neither his fainting nor that the patient had died, and the patient&#039;s heart was already beating again. He stood up and administered the adenosine for the rest of the operation without saying anything.

The story calls attention to another fact of anesthesia: the anesthetist is the only person in the operating room paying attention to whether you&#039;re still alive.]]></description>
