Thanks Tom. My doctor actually voluntarily confessed to this. At least he&#039;s honest. Oh, and thanks for the link!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;he claimed that he did not know of the scientific literature on diet and health. He said he only reads the medical literature. I wasnâ€™t aware of these literatures being separate! He apparently is not concerned or even interested in medical and nutritional science, even though heâ€™s a general practitioner whose primary responsibility is the health of his patients!&lt;/i&gt;

Michael Eades, a physician, wrote a post about how to talk to your doctor about diet:
http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/statins/talking-diet-your-doctor/


In it he explains that most doctors never read scientific papers and are probably not even capable of it.  By &quot;medical literature&quot; your doctor is referring to case reports, which Eades says is what most practicing physicians are familar with and capable of grasping.  (He links to a case report to print and bring to your physician.)

		<description><![CDATA[Aaron, he knows little or nothing about nutrition but cautions you against making certain dietary changes.  Yeah, just like Orac.  He knows little or nothing about experimental design, but he cautions against a certain experimental design. As for the apathy (at least Orac isn&#039;t apathetic) a friend of mine had the same experience. He brought his doctor some data he had collected himself that was highly relevant to what to do about his problem. The doctor didn&#039;t care. Perhaps I should be happy that when I was a graduate student and showed my dermatologist that one of the medicines he had prescribed had no effect on my acne, he was irritated (rather than apathetic).

Nathan, I think &quot;accomplish what they think it will&quot; might mean something like &quot;help others decide whether or not to try lithium.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had an annual check up yesterday. My doctor is at an HMO (Kaiser Permanente). I told him about my dietary changes in response to having read Gary Taubes&#039; book &quot;Good Calories, Bad Calories&quot; (which he had never heard of!), posts on this blog, and on Stephen&#039;s blog (http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/), etc. My dietary changes include:  increased consumption of eggs, meat, dairy; decreased consumption of wheat and unsprouted/unsoaked grains and legumes and replacement with sprouted grains and non-gluten grains; replacement of vegetable oils with animal oils, such as butter and lard in my cooking; and taking high-vitamin cod liver oil and butter oil, ala Westin Price recommendations). He was very skeptical (except of the cod liver oil of which he approved) and cautioned me against making these dietary changes. I also asked him if he could request a fatty-acid test, but he declined because it was not a standard test of Kaiser&#039;s. I asked him why he disapproved of my dietary changes and he said that, while there are some papers that may show benefits of each of the changes I have made, there are just as many papers showing the opposite. BUT he claimed that he did not know of the scientific literature on diet and health. He said he only reads the medical literature. I wasn&#039;t aware of these literatures being separate! He apparently is not concerned or even interested in medical and nutritional science, even though he&#039;s a general practitioner whose primary responsibility is the health of his patients! Instead, he seemed comfortable having the party line handed down from the &quot;officials&quot; above, and not straying from the boundaries set by the AMA (and AHA, etc.). This is a huge problem with the medical community as I see it. The great thing about the internet is not only the availability of information, but also the ability of a conscientious person to take matters into their own hand to gather information for themselves, make their own decisions, and share that information (e.g., these blogs) with other interested people.

Some doctors are threatened by this change in information access. But even worse in my opinion is that others are merely apathetic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a strong whiff of guild jealousy in Orac&#039;s protestations.  To &quot;accomplish what they think it will&quot; can&#039;t mean anything but &quot;maybe get better&quot;.

What good could it possibly do them to get better if they aren&#039;t really certain &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they got better?  How dare they deprive some honest primary investigator of a control?  Even if it works, in the end, they&#039;re just putting off the day when a patentable lithium-analog is approved for on-label use.]]></description>
