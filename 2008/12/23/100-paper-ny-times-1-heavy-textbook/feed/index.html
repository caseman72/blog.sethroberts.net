		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, I like some textbooks a lot, too -- for example, Calculus by Ralph Palmer Agnew. Feynman&#039;s Lectures on Physics were interesting (if problematic for teaching problem solving). But the textbooks I like are a tiny fraction of all textbooks. I think the replacement for heavy textbooks is careful selection of more focussed material. That&#039;s what I did when I taught intro psych. I didn&#039;t use a heavy textbook, I used a bunch of smaller books, such as Obedience by Milgram.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think you should be so down on textbooks.  I like some textbooks a lot--not just my own, also other books such as Lohr&#039;s survey sampling book.  Googling just doesn&#039;t give you the clear info you can get from a coherent book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[NE1, yeah, the web is incoherent. But I agree with Taylor, any journalist should be able to find news on the web, no need to have the NY Times figure it out for you. Isn&#039;t journalism about news gathering? That&#039;s why this example is so telling. Likewise for many subjects. For example, isn&#039;t science about gathering info?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There may have been one course I took in college which required me to take the textbook to class: Chinese, where repetition was a large goal of the meetings.  Most value adding classes these days definitely shouldn&#039;t require the physical presence of textbooks, but the collection of a coherent pedagogy at home can be more useful than a thousand wiki pages from a thousand authors.  

I can already get most of my textbooks electronically, but they really just aren&#039;t the same.  With a book, for example, you can flip through at the correct prior-knowledge-adjusted rate until you find the page you know is there.  It&#039;s not so easy currently with ebooks.]]></description>
