		<description><![CDATA[I do sudoku puzzles with a special rule to make them harder, and I do three in one sitting to correct for any given puzzle being too hard or easy.

(Actually, the special rule that I use is two rules: I do all the 1s first, then all the 2s, and so on. Within I number, I progress from left to right, going down the page. So first, I fill in any blank 1 in the upper-left square. Then I fill in any blank 1 in the upper-center square. Third, I fill in any blank 1 in the upper right square, and so on, until the ones are complete. The I do all the 2s. And so on.)

Using a given publisher, and staying within a given difficulty rank (I only do &quot;hard&quot; ones), a &#039;set&#039; of three is a good self-test for how sharp my mind is.

I suspect that some outside experiment would verify this. 

After a period of (what I will call) &quot;burn in&quot;, of probably the first few hundred puzzles I ever did, I have stopped learning anything. I am not improving as time goes by. 

So now, on a good day, I can sit down and do three puzzles (subject to my handicapping rule, above) in 20 minutes or so. If there is something wrong with my mind (distracted, anxious, hungover, tired, etc.), I will make mistakes or take forever, or sometimes be unable to complete one.

Sometimes I&#039;ll be stumped by a puzzle, but also know that I&#039;m tired, or &quot;off&quot;--and I&#039;ll look at the same puzzle a different day and find it easy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben, thanks for the link. I hope to use it in my talks.
Justin, my other test is a simple arithmetic test.  Corrections make a big difference there, too. As for brain imaging, you might want to see my recent post on voodoo correlations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a fairly complicated measure with the corrections involved. I have heard of a guy doing simple arithmetic selected at random to test his cognitive abilities. I just think it&#039;s so hard to measure because (1) you will get better at anything you keep doing even if it is typing random letters, and (2) trying to make tests unique inevitably means some tests will be more difficult than others.

I don&#039;t know of any solution to this problem; it seems that until we can all have our own personal brain imaging equipment we will simply have to accept imperfect measures.]]></description>
