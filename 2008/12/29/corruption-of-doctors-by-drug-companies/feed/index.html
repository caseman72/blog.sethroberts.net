		<description><![CDATA[Pietr, this is an aspect of clinical trials I didn&#039;t know about. Patients in clinical trials are not allowed to seek other treatments? 

What was the amino acid precursor? and what was the neurodegenerative condition?

How did the professors doing the study convey their incredible request?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

In your quote, Angell writes &quot;should.&quot;  So it doesn&#039;t sound like she &quot;expecftes a researcher . . . to be honest.&quot;  She&#039;s just saying that&#039;s how it should be.

On a slightly related note, I had a question years ago about something else that Angell wrote; see here:
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2006/06/costs-and-benef.html

I was not able to contact her to get her response.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Furthermore, the pharmaceutical-medical school conglomeration suppresses new ideas that utilize treatment that does not enrich the drug companies. A decade ago, I found that the use of natural amino acid precursors could patially remit a fatal neurodegenerative condition. That I was having favorable results permeated the patients being studied at my local prestigious medical school. 

The investigators were furious that their patients were taking my treatment. They were concerned that this intervention threatened the study, the health of their patients was incidental. All attempts to reason with these professors were futile.They issued an ultimatum, &quot;If you continue the precursor treatment we will cast you off, you will be dropped by our institution.&quot; 

Marcia Angell should call researchers by their proper name, &quot;whores.&quot;]]></description>
