		<description><![CDATA[Section 14 of the paper discusses estimation of bias and variance from adjustment methods, and makes explicit that they are being combined in the conventional way: by adding the squared bias to the variance to get mean squared error.

Maybe mean squared error is not the right way to measure accuracy, but it&#039;s not like Freedman invented it just to make his argument! In fact, he&#039;s responding to arguments in favor of adjustment which also cast the discussion in this framework. For better or for worse, most of the common statistical tools (mean, variance, regression) are closely tied to MSE. 

At least, MSE has the virtue that the random and systematic errors can be separated additively, which makes it a lot easier to discuss their relative contributions.  If, for example, we were primarily interested in mean absolute error, another reasonable candidate, we would have no nice way to decompose it into systematic and random parts,  and &quot;variance&quot; (MSE of an unbiased estimate) would have no particular importance.

So, if your criticism of Freedman boils down to &quot;he used MSE without justifying it&quot; - I agree he is guilty of that, along with most of the rest of the statistical profession. However, it doesn&#039;t seem to justify the harsh words in your original post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, no I&#039;m not claiming that. I&#039;m claiming that it was a bad idea to omit the bias/variance distinction when discussing the &quot;accuracy&quot; of the census and the effects of adjustment. 

In a certain way I agree with you. It doesn&#039;t necessarily resemble not returning library books to claim the census shouldn&#039;t have been adjusted. If someone made clear the bias/variance difference and explained their relative weighting scheme -- why they chose to weight bias like this and variance like that -- that would be reasonable. I saw nothing like that in Freedman&#039;s writings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
Mean squared error is indeed arbitrary, as is the notion of variance itself. That is not the main point. The main point is that pretty much however you would like to define &quot;total error,&quot; it is possible to increase the total error while reducing bias (unless the only thing you care about is bias, in which case what you want to do is pick a really random sample of one person).  

Freedman argues that this actually happens, for a reasonable (and conventional, though arbitrarily so) measure of total error, when the usual techniques are applied to adjust the census. You are claiming, I think, that the bias-reduction benefits of census adjustment outweigh the costs of increasing other kinds of error.  This isn&#039;t self evidently true or false. Freedman has given some reasons for believing it is false. What are your reasons for believing it is true?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, your &quot;mean squared error&quot; is only one of an infinity of ways of combining bias and variance to get an overall measure of goodness/badness. Given that we value fairness (lack of bias) more than uniformity (lack of variance), it is hardly an obvious choice. Freedman&#039;s idea that his particular relative weighting of bias and variance was so sure -- on such a &quot;firm statistical foundation&quot; -- as to not need mentioning or discussion, that no reasonable person could disagree, really does resemble not returning library books in its self-centeredness. For more about why I thought Freedman&#039;s position resembled not returning library books, read the rest of the post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
You initially claimed that it was &quot;ridiculous&quot; to recommend against trying to remove bias.  It is not ridiculous if the attempt to reduce the bias increases the variance so much that the mean squared error increases overall, which is exactly what the quote (and the paper) from Freedman says. I bring up mean squared error since that is the thing of which variance and (squared) bias are components.  Freedman didn&#039;t say &quot;mean squared error&quot; since the average person would not have understood that. Instead he said &quot;accuracy.&quot; The misleading quote from you is &quot;He was against adjusting the census to remove bias caused by undercount. This was only slightly less ridiculous than not returning library books.&quot; You have offered no argument for this statement; Freedman on the other hand, offers a detailed argument for his position in the paper cited.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,
As you say, adjustments will likely increase variance and reduce bias. A large increase in variance may not be worth a small reduction in bias, so it is not clear that adjustments are a good idea. To talk about &quot;accuracy&quot; is simply to talk about the net effect, which is what we care about. It seems much more misleading to focus on only one component at a time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Technically you are right that there is a possibility of adjustment when the sample/resample undercounts are not perfectly correlated. 
Practically speaking, I do not know of any census adjustment schemes which allow for and adjust for such dependence. Erikson-Kadane et. al (EK). whom Freedman was arguing against, did assume independence in producing their adjustments.
It is strange that the central issue: whether or not an adjustment will produce a more accurate count, is viewed as a distraction by you. 
I propose to subtract random numbers to adjust the census -- this is likely to improve the census, since it is known that there is an undercount. 
EK proposed a scheme which, as Freedman demonstrated, was essentially equivalent. He showed this in three different ways.
A: Following exactly the same methodology, but using an alternative series to the one picked by EK (out of 18 equivalent series) produces seriously different adjustments.
B: Changing some of the theoretical assumptions (in particular independence) required for the adjustments to more plausible ones, leads to seriously different numbers for adjustment.
C: &quot;Shrinkage,&quot; the Bayesian methodology for producing adjustments used by EK requires specification of a prior distribution. This is elegantly finessed via the empirical Bayes method actually used by EK, where prior assumptions are hidden at a deeper level. By changing these, one can arrive at substantially different numbers. In particular, someone who knows the game well can produce numbers which favor one state over another or to suit his own political preferences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Mike, thanks for the reference. I&#039;ve read that paper.  Before I read it I understood that adjustments are inevitably inaccurate and thus increase the variation of the final estimate. Their value is that they are more likely to decrease bias than to increase it -- at least, this is the heart of the argument for adjustment. Going on and on about whether the adjustments increase or decrease &quot;accuracy&quot; as that paper does is just a distraction.

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I knew about Freedman&#039;s census ideas long long before his obituary.

Asad Zeman, I&#039;ve now read the citation you gave. You are wrong when you write &quot;a fundamental assumption that makes adjustment possible is that these two undercounts are INDEPENDENT.&quot; The assumption that makes adjustment possible is that the two undercounts are not PERFECTLY CORRELATED. Which is far more plausible. Wachter and Freedman, as far as I can tell, ignore this point. No sane person ever thought census adjustment would eliminate bias; they merely thought it was more likely to reduce it than increase it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once the decision is made to adjust the census results, the adjustment will be just one more political issue. There is no guarantee that unbiased statistical methods will be used. Do you think the average (or above-average) Congressman understands the difference between variance and bias? Would he even want to? All he has to know is how to get his party&#039;s statisticians on the committee that does the adjustments. 

On a related question, how would everyone feel about using statistical methods to adjust the vote totals in elections? The arguments would be similar. A lot of people don&#039;t vote, we could get a more accurate outcome with adjustment. Right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Terry, you wrote &quot;given the likelihood that undercounts are correlated&quot; -- I don&#039;t think anyone disputes this either. This is the puzzle behind Freedman&#039;s criticisms: he seemed to equate lack of perfection with uselessness. I haven&#039;t read the Wachter and Freedman yet, but I will, and then after that maybe I will understand Freedman&#039;s criticisms better.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think anyone is disputing whther biases exist in the census adjustments.  On any given census you can be sure that it will be biased one way or another depending on the methodologies used. Given the likelihood that undercounts are correlated, I agree with Mr. Zaman, Wachter  and Freedman, in that the adjustments are likely &quot;less than useless&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[Freedman argued that census adjustment would introduce bias of unknown magnitude. He proved this by following essentially the same methodology but making minor changes, and showing that substantial differences would arise in the adjustment. As Jas says, the devil is in the details, which must be understood here to follow what is going on. 

Following the census, there is a survey which attempts to measure the undercount which occurred in the census. This survey itself is subject to the same undercount problem as the census. A fundamental assumption which makes adjustment possible is that these two undercounts are INDEPENDENT.  Freedman argues that this is not true -- a person who is undercounted in the census is also likely to be undercounted in the subsequent survey. This makes eminent sense. If there is correlation between the undercounts, this will lead to bias in the adjustment. How large this bias can be is assessed in the paper cited below, which shows that it is likely to be so large as to make the adjustment worse than useless.

		<description><![CDATA[It is not clear if census adjustment would have reduced bias (at the cost of variance) as you state.  Indeed my bet is that David Freedman is correct: model adjustment would have made the bias worse.  The issue is not one of just random sampling.  Much model based extrapolation was being proposed. The devil is in the details, and vague gestures do not an argument make.  A hint of the complexity is that by the 2000 census the partisan impact of the undercount was probably the reverse of what you conjecture.  For the purposes of apportionment, the south west (e.g., states like Texas) would have gained Congressional seats and hence electoral college votes at the expense of the north east.  So, a correction would have been a win for the Republicans in national elections.  Note that apportionment counts illegal immigrants, although they cannot vote.  Much like many academics, the political parties took their positions based on weak evidence and held their ground even when the facts shifted.  Of course the scientific issue is that the undercount is difficult to fix and who is being undercounted is constantly changing.  The problem is more difficult than calculating the partisan impact, and most people can&#039;t even get that part right.]]></description>
