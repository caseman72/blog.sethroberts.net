		<description><![CDATA[Well, fusion is different in that many people think it is just a matter of engineering -- kind of like using light to make computers.  Predicted in the 40s and 50s, finally getting engineered.

The other thing is that predictions of how much longer it would take, back in the early 1970s before they even had a first bottle attempt, were between 20 and 100 years.  I read through all the congressional reports for the era (for another project) and the debate and estimates were quite interesting.

We don&#039;t have Mars mission, and they&#039;ve been working towards one for forty years.  Should they just cut bait?  Or is it predictable engineering and cost issues?

Does that make sense?  I&#039;m not sure they are right, but why they feel the way they do makes a lot of sense.]]></description>
