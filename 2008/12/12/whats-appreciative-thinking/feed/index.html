		<description><![CDATA[Josh, that&#039;s a good way to teach it. I&#039;m amused that it was called a course in reviewing. That&#039;s like calling a course in arithmetic &quot;how to add 5 and 6&quot;. The skills are far more useful than just making you a better reviewer. An editor would be more likely than the rest of us to teach such a course because of the access to rejected manuscripts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, agree with so many here -- this is a great post and also ages well.  I had a prof in grad school who understood this and was able to get it across very effectively. Will share it on the chance it may be helpful to others.

The prof was editor of a leading psych journal and taught a course in reviewing.  Students were given papers that had been previously submitted to the journal and on which editorial decisions had already been made...only we didn&#039;t know the results.  Our job was to read, critique/appreciate and then decide whether to accept or reject each submission. Needless to say, we were all good at finding flaws in everything.  But the real lesson came when we had to say &quot;in or out.&quot;  Although we could find faults and flaws in literally everything, we saw that the litmus test for acceptance was whether the paper made a meaningful contribution to the field..warts and all.  That really stuck with me.  Recently came across George Box&#039;s quote &quot;All models are wrong, some are useful,&quot; which is even more succinct. -- jj]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post. I have my own version of this called Benign Gullibility (&quot;Hey, this new idea looks spiffing! I wonder what happens if I base my life on it?&quot; - for a few moments or so) but I like yours better and might steal it.

Three things:

1. The first two comments made me so cross, I wrote a post criticising them.
2. The rest of the comments more than made up for them.
3. Just in case, I strongly recommending following all of Sean Murphy&#039;s reading recommendations. Ace.

I wonder if you could develop your Appreciative Thinking by working on developing an ability in and an awareness of the Semantic Pause?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whether you criticise or praise a paper, to do the job well you have to start by taking it seriously. 

This means assuming the content is true and trying to imagine what are some of the implications. If the implications are absurd or contradictory then your approach will be considered critical. If they are novel and interesting then you will be considered appreciative.

But it&#039;s basically the same process either way. And either way you do honour to the paper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Appreciative writing is a useful task for second and third hand dealers in ideas when major figures have become forgotten or neglected because they were out of step with the fashions of their time or have been benched for various reasons. Like changes in fashion and failure to do the academic and entrepreneurial networking that is required to keep their ideas alive (see Selgin on the failures of Menger and Bohm Bawerk and Ian Jarvie on Popper). 

Other examples of neglected major figures are:

Ian D Suttie (1889-1935) who could have radically changed the course of psychoanalysis in a more scientific and humanistic direction.
Jacques Barzun (1907 - ) a towering figure in education, cultural studies and the history of ideas.
Rene Wellek (1903- 1995) arguable the leading figure in literary scholarhip of the 20th century.
Yvor Winters (1900-1968) who explored the many and various ways that irrationalism is promoted by defective theories of literataure with particular reference to American novelists and poets.
Karl Buhler (1879-1963), a pivotal figure in psychology and linguistic studies, driven out of Austria in 1938 into academic obscurity in the US and scandalously written out of the history of psychology by academic rivals.

Profiles of the above figures (and others such as Bill Hutt and Peter Baur who were marginalised until picked up by the Austrians) can be found in the four editions of the Revivalist series.

		<description><![CDATA[nice post -- i just added your blog to my RSS because of it.

i&#039;d posit that most creativity is because of mistakes.  most people are focused on learning from their own mistakes but it&#039;s considerably less painful to learn from others&#039; mistakes.

academia and business have an obnoxiously strong ethic about covering up failed work.  can you publish a paper which shows all the approaches you tried but did not get a result?  can you even publish a paper which shows the approaches that tried and failed only to succeed on the 20th try?  no, you omit the mistakes.  i think that&#039;s unfortunate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, I totally agree. I went to grad school in international development economics, and one big reason why I&#039;m not working in the field is because I have partially lost the ability to have optimism in development initiatives. Grad school taught me to be so critical of every idea that it&#039;s hard for me to see what might work and think that 95% of efforts are wasted. Help, please!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Seth.

I entered into my MA program very much in the hard-nosed tradition of critical thinking.  The school I was attending, The School for International Training, was a very different place.  One of the profs recommended that I read Peter Elbow&#039;s &quot;The Believing Game&quot;, an essay published in 1972 in the appendix of his wildly popular book &quot;Writing without Teachers&quot;.  This essay was instrumental for me as a social scientist and teacher.  Here is an updated version, a 2008 essay in which Elbow has re-cast his concept as &quot;Methodological Believing&quot; -- it&#039;s very much like what you&#039;re advocating in Appreciative Thinking; I hope you find it useful!  http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=peter_elbow]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth: Evelyn has already suggested two good frameworks for appreciative thinking, let me suggest one reference for each that are useful for employing them in a problem solving context.

The Thin Book of Appreciative Inquiry

The â€œPositive Deviantâ€ article by Ed Dorsey in the November 2000 Fast Company has a clear codification of Sternin&#039;s approach

In one of those weird synchronicities I had blogged about this here 
http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2009/12/15/early-customer-conversations-use-appreciative-inquiry-and-amplify-positive-deviance/

One other thing I started to do about three years ago was to count my blessings by posting endorsements on LinkedIn for folks that I had worked with in the past and either had a shared success with or come away impressed from our interactions. It&#039;s another way to encourage yourself to appreciate people&#039;s strengths and contribution to your own successes. 

I very much enjoy your blog and your disciplined approach to self-experimentation.

<p>The Thin Book of Appreciative Inquiry<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,  I think that the meaning of &quot;critical thinking&quot; in an English Lit course is what you are describing as &quot;appreciative thinking&quot;.  It&#039;s a way of saying that students will be expected to say more about the subject than &quot;awesome&quot; or &quot;it sucked&quot;.  They will be expected to recognize it as an artifact of a time, an author, and a culture.  What&#039;s Melville doing when he spends dozens of pages on detail of whale butchering?  Is it meant to be taken literally, or is he saying something else, and if the latter, was he successful?  That&#039;s critical thinking, in the Western academic school of thought.

There are different schools of criticism, though, within and without academia, and some works are more or less suited to one or the other.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Seth.  Academia is not the only realm affected by over-negativity, in my opinion.  It&#039;s popular to &quot;bash&quot; these days.  Critical thinking is essential, but we should also be able to extract some kernel of worthwhile information from every single life experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth,

In Nelson and Winter&#039;s Evolutionary Economics (Harvard, 1981), they distinguish between &quot;appreciative theory&quot; and &quot;formal theory&quot;.  While not identical to your notion of &quot;appreciative thinking&quot;, it is attempting to get at something similar but at the level of the scholar himself/herself and our enterprise in general.
