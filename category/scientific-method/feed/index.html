				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 1960s, a Caltech geochemist named Clair Patterson made the case that there had been worldwide contamination of living things by lead, due to the lead in gasoline. There were great increases in the amount of lead in fish and human skeletons, for example. More than anyone else he was responsible for <a href="http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006fall/envr/230/001/Needleman_2000.pdf" target="_blank">the elimination of lead in gasoline</a>. (By coincidence, this was just shown on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Spacetime_Odyssey" target="_blank">the new <em>Cosmos</em> TV series</a>.) A professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Needleman" target="_blank">Herbert Needleman</a> did some of the most important toxicology, linking lead exposure (presumably from paint) and IQ in children. Children with more lead in their teeth had lower IQ scores. The importance of this finding is shown by the fact he was accused of scientific misconduct.<span id="more-13499"></span></p>
<p>When lead was eliminated from gasoline, blood levels of lead went down &#8212; and so did crime. The idea that childhood lead exposure causes crime many years later explains so many otherwise-hard-to-explain facts, especially worldwide declines in crime rates, that I conclude it&#8217;s true: lead exposure does cause criminality. Kevin Drum wrote <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline" target="_blank">a long article about this in <em>Mother Jones</em> a year ago</a> and followed up his original article <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/01/lead-and-crime-linkfest" target="_blank">in many ways</a>. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27067615" target="_blank">A BBC radio show yesterday</a> covered the topic.</p>
<p>This interests me for two reasons. One is simple. It shows the value of <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114619130176100669530" target="_blank">monitoring your own brain function</a> by using something like the brain test I have often blogged about &#8212; e.g., to notice that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">butter made me smarter </a>or <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/26/damage-due-to-mercury-revealed-by-brain-test/" target="_blank">mercury in my teeth fillings made me stupider.</a> There&#8217;s still lots of lead in the world &#8212; in old windowpanes, for example. And you are exposed to thousands of other modern chemicals (e.g., in cleaning products) whose effects on your brain are essentially unknown.</p>
<p>The other reason is complicated. It involves the context of this discovery. Mostly, the health research establishment has been unable to get anything right. Heart disease has been the #1 killer for decades; doctors still claim (and vast number of people, including <em>New York Times</em> health writers, believe them) that it is caused by cholesterol. Depression and bipolar disorder might be the single greatest cause of suffering nowadays &#8212; and psychiatrists are still claiming it is caused by &#8220;chemical imbalance&#8221; in the brain. (For my view of what causes depression, see <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/morning-faces-therapy-resources/" target="_blank">this</a>.) Beyond figuring out that lung cancer is caused by smoking, there has been almost no progress understanding what causes cancer. The &#8220;oncogene theory&#8221; of cancer turned out to be a dead end. There have been little bits of progress here and there but on the big issues, there has been nonsense decade after decade &#8212; and lack of realization that it is nonsense.</p>
<p>In contrast, taking lead out of gasoline was a big step forward in public health and pointing out the link to crime a big step forward in understanding crime. Rare examples of progress. What can I learn from that? I have stressed <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/scientific-method/insideroutsider/" target="_blank">the importance of insider/outsiders</a> &#8212; people close enough to understand but far enough away to have freedom. The lead/crime case supports that. Clair Patterson was a geochemist, not a toxicologist. Rick Nevin, the first person to argue that lead causes crime, was an economist, not a criminologist. Both of them had a good methodological understanding and used this to shed light on a different area than their original training. (Obviously I have used my background in experimental psychology, especially my methodological knowledge &#8212; how to experiment, how to measure brain function &#8212; to shed light on many health questions.) The lead/crime link also supports my view that the notion that &#8220;correlation does not equal causation&#8221; does more harm than good. The immediate response of many many people to the lead/crime evidence was exactly that &#8212; putting them on what turned out to be the wrong side. Whatever truth <em>correlation does not equal causation</em> might have is outweighed by the damage it does when it is used to ignore evidence. How smart do you have to be to realize &#8220;correlation does not equal causation&#8221; is stupid? To me <em>don&#8217;t ignore evidence</em> is the most important principle of science. But many university professors don&#8217;t agree with me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also impressed &#8212; in a good way &#8212; by Drum&#8217;s article. At least it exists. Anyone can read it and then look further, for example at <a href="http://pic.plover.com/Nevin/Nevin2007.pdf" target="_blank">original scientific articles</a>. I wouldn&#8217;t say it was easy to write but it did not require expensive travel, extensive interviews, or months of research. It did require original thinking. In contrast, the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>The New Yorker</em>, which do allow expensive time-consuming journalism, haven&#8217;t published anything nearly as good in decades. The <em>New York Times</em>&#8216;s idea of high-quality journalism seems to be <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/%22paying+till+it+hurts%22" target="_blank">a series about the high cost of health care</a> while <em>The New Yorker</em> weighs in on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/02/04/130204fa_fact_specter?currentPage=all" target="_blank">the harm done by Dr. Mehmet Oz</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I was in Seoul, at <a href="http://casapepepark.com/" target="_blank">Casa Pepe Guest House</a>. Sensationally good at a very low price. It really is a guest house &#8212; attached to a house &#8212; with a separate entrance. There are four rooms, with shared kitchen and bathroom. The owner is an renowned chef. The first evening he brought salad and wine from his (Japanese) restaurant. The first morning, he invited me to come with him to buy fish at the Seoul fish market. Every morning, he made breakfast &#8212; something different each time.</p>
<p>I found it through hotels.com. On their map, it was off by itself. I thought that meant bad location, but the opposite was true. It is the sort of good location you cannot normally get. It is near the Blue House (Korea&#8217;s White House) and many foreign embassies and is very safe. Dozens of interesting restaurants and cafes are nearby. (Even more than the rest of Seoul.) The neighborhood is the Beverly Hills of Korea, with better (and cheaper) restaurants and less pretentious architecture. Casa Pepe started about a year ago, with a remodelling. Everything is new and clean. The floor is heated. The building is up a steep path and has a nice view of streets, hills and houses. Free laundry. All for less than $50/day.</p>
<p>During my stay I briefly overlapped with <i>a Tsinghua student</i> (how could that possibly happen?) but otherwise I was the only person.</p>
<p>Why is it so nice? The owner said, &#8220;It&#8217;s my hobby.&#8221; I think that explains it.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve said</a> that doing a job and doing science are fundamentally incompatible. Any job requires steady and repeated output. You do the same thing over and over. The goal of science is discovery &#8212; and a discovery is inherently unpredictable and unrepeatable. (Art is a job with science-like elements &#8212; and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">artists were the first scientists</a>.) Casa Pepe Guest House illustrates another side of the job/science conflict: A job is inherently conformist. You give people, especially customers and your boss, what they expect. Science is inherently nonconformist. The more a discovery challenges &#8220;what everyone knows&#8221;, the better. Hobbies make this point because they can vary more than jobs. If you make tables as a hobby, for example, your tables can vary more than if you make tables for a living. Casa Pepe is way outside (better) what one expects from a rented room.</p>
<p>Another way Casa Pepe is unusual is that it is very hard to find, even if you study <a href="http://casapepepark.com/sub01/sub02.php" target="_blank">the directions</a>. I found it by knocking on a neighbor&#8217;s door. The neighbor called Casa Pepe. Someone from Casa Pepe came to meet the neighbor and me on the street &#8212; it was too hard <em>to tell the neighbor</em> where it was. Here are better directions. From Incheon Airport, take airport bus 6112 to the Hangsun University stop. Go to Exit 6 of the nearby subway station (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansung_University_Station" target="_blank">Hangsun University Station</a> on Line 4). Walk up the street (Seongbuk-ro) indicated by Exit 6 &#8212; toward the hills. After walking about 13 minutes, where the road veers right, you will see a sign that says <strong>Seongbuk-ro 19-gil</strong> (gil = side street), which points almost exactly to a steep concrete path on the left perpendicular to the street. It is the width of a driveway. Go up about 40 meters. Casa Pepe is on the right &#8212; a white house with a red door, with a sign that says &#8220;casa pepe&#8221;. Don&#8217;t be misled by the fact that the listed address is not on Seongbuk-ro 19-gil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t been interested in the work of John Ioannidis because it seems unrelated to discovery. Ioannidis says too many papers are &#8220;wrong&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know how the fraction of &#8220;wrong&#8221; papers is related to the rate of discovery. For example, what percentage of &#8220;wrong&#8221; papers produces the most discovery? Ioannidis doesn&#8217;t seem to think about this. Yet that is the goal of science &#8212; better understanding. Not &#8220;right&#8221; papers.<span id="more-12666"></span></p>
<p>Almost all important health discoveries are discoveries of new cause-effect relationships. <em>If you do X, Y happens</em>. My view of the problem with modern health science is nothing like what Ioannidis and other critics (such as the &#8220;couldn&#8217;t replicate Finding X&#8221; critics) say. It is lack of progress on major health questions (e.g., what causes depression?), emphasized every year by awarding of the Nobel Prize in Medicine to research of little or no practical value. Almost every year, the Nobel Prize press office says the honored research <em>will be useful in the future</em>. The lack of progress shows no sign of ending.</p>
<p>The best that can be said about recent critics of science, such as Ioannidis and Danny Kahneman, my former colleague, is they see there&#8217;s a problem. The worst that can be said about them is they fail to understand the cause of the problem. This is why their proposed solutions could easily make the problem worse.</p>
<p>Whenever you do an experiment &#8212; psychology and the health sciences are almost all experimental &#8212; you &#8220;use up&#8221; the effect you are studying (X causes Y). You can do an experiment to learn if X causes Y only so many times. After that, you know the answer and a new experiment is pointless. Professional scientists are only able to test ideas (cause-effect statements) that are fairly plausible. With such ideas, a publishable outcome is likely enough to be worth the cost of testing. They are unable to test implausible ideas, because such experiments are not likely enough to produce a publishable outcome. With limited resources, they must generate a certain number of published papers per year, at least if they want a career.</p>
<p>To have a viable system, you need to generate new plausible ideas at at least the same rate you are using them up. Otherwise you will run out. You must design your experiments so that they accomplish this. Not necessarily every experiment, but your experiments in aggregate. It isn&#8217;t easy to find new plausible ideas. If you think <em>I&#8217;ll just get on with my career, generating papers as fast as possible</em> and leave it to someone else to come up with new ideas worth testing, then your field will run downhill as plausible ideas are used up and not replaced. This is what has happened in several fields, including mine (animal learning). In psychology much greater concern about both fraud and lack of replicability have started at about the same time. I believe both (more fraud, more lack of replicability) stem from the increasing difficulty of honest (or more honest) research.</p>
<p>A friend who is a psychology professor agreed with me that psychologists &#8212; at least him &#8212; didn&#8217;t know how to generate new ideas worth testing. &#8220;Do you?&#8221; he asked. I said I did:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. They [= psychologists] should modify their data collection. In my experience, new ideas almost always come from carefully collected data. They don&#8217;t come from introspection, talking to friends, reading the newspaper, watching TV, going to talks, etc.</p>
<p>2. Finding new ideas worth testing means finding new ideas that are plausible enough to be worth the cost of testing. To find new ideas with sufficient plausibility to test you need to test implausible ideas. A small fraction will pass the test, gaining plausibility. They will become sufficiently plausible to be worth testing.</p>
<p>3. To test implausible ideas in a career-consistent manner, you need to be able to test them very cheaply. Few if any psychologists have thought about this. They don&#8217;t realize how important it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>When you have very cheap tests, you can test far more ideas than you can if you only have expensive tests. You need a &#8220;test set&#8221;: very cheap tests, cheap tests, almost-cheap tests, and so on. Ideas that pass a very cheap test become worth testing with a cheap test, those that pass a cheap test become worth testing with an almost cheap test, and so on. With current methods (all tests are expensive), perhaps social psychology professors who want to publish have a set of 50 ideas that are plausible enough to be worth the cost of testing. Those ideas get tested over and over, using them up. Were cheap tests available, perhaps the same professors could choose from a set of 1000 ideas those they want to test. Of those 1000 ideas, 950 were too implausible to test with expensive tests. Among those 950, I believe, would be some ideas that when tested seemed to be true.</p>
<p>I came to these beliefs trying to understand why <a href="http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">my self-experimentation</a> did a good job of finding new ideas worth testing. <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf">I concluded</a> that the secret was this: I was able to test implausible ideas very cheaply &#8212; thousands of times more cheaply than professional scientists. Self-tracking &#8212; keeping track of my sleep, for example, and looking for outliers &#8212; was a very cheap way of getting new ideas about what controls sleep. Self-experimentation was a slightly more expensive (but still very cheap) way to test ideas that self-tracking came up with.</p>
<p>Many people have complained about a lack of replicability problem in psychology, including my friend and co-author <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/replication-studies-bad-copy-1.10634" target="_blank">Hal Pashler</a>. An obvious solution is to raise the bar for publication: require better (= stronger) evidence. Sure, this will improve the quality of testing, but how will it affect the rate of production of plausible new ideas? My cost-of-test proposal suggests it will <em>reduce</em> that rate of production. I am saying that cheap tests are all important. Raising the publication bar will make the only test you have more expensive. What if the replication problem is a response to lack of plausible new ideas? Then this solution to the problem would make the problem worse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, Eric Lander, who identified himself as &#8220;President and Founding Director of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT [and] one of the principal leaders of the Human Genome Project, directing the largest center in the international project&#8221; did a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything). One of the questions did not go as expected:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> As an advisor to the President, what is being done or do you think will be done to increase the attractiveness of students finishing PhD programs in science? </p>
<p><strong>Lander</strong> We need to shorten the time for getting a PhD and for a first faculty job. Young people should get out into the scientific world early, when they have lots of fresh ideas. We should encourage grants to young scientists and should encourage them to take big risks. When you&#8217;re taking big risks, science is amazingly fun.</p>
<p>The response to this answer was very negative.</p>
<blockquote><p>With all due respect, this is a ludicrous statement. . . The true problem is the way in which you fund science. You fund projects and proposals. In order to get these projects funded, the preliminary data has to be essentially the whole project being done. Then you fund at a 6% percent line. It leads to cronyism in the peer review process and a general sense of despair in scientists. How about you radically change the funding system for PIs?</p>
<p>I too am disappointed with Dr. Lander&#8217;s response to possibly THE most important question here regarding training basic scientists.</p>
<p>Do you truly believe this? . . . There is no reason to encourage more students to go into science if there is not enough government funding to support their careers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, this is not important. It just pleased me that someone questioned Dr. Lander&#8217;s absurd claims, which he makes often. &#8220;We should encourage young scientists to take big risks&#8221;. Yes, I agree, does he really believe this? Do he really believe that someone coming up for tenure should take big risks?</p>

Another was her observation that his relatives said he was &#8220;brilliant&#8221;, without giving any examples. His brilliance had remained perfectly hidden &#8211; <em>until now</em>. A third was her conclusion that he was obsessed with secrecy and distrusted government &#8211; <em>just like the inventor of bitcoin</em> (according to her). Felix Salmon <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/03/07/the-satoshi-paradox/" target="_blank">was quite wrong</a> when he said there are some very strange coincidences and the pieces of her argument &#8220;fit elegantly together&#8221;. Actually, her argument is worthless from top to bottom. Salmon was right, however, when he said that the engineer&#8217;s English shows he couldn&#8217;t possibly have invented bitcoin. As Salmon says, Goodman ignored this itty-bitty problem.</p>
<p>Who <em>is</em> the inventor of bitcoin? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo" target="_blank">Nick Szabo</a>, a former law professor at George Washington University. This idea first surfaced a few months ago in <a href="https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-nick-szabo/" target="_blank">an anonymous blog post based on textual analysis</a>. Szabo used certain phrases in the original bitcoin description far more than a bunch of other possible candidates. That is real evidence. The hypothesis that Szabo is the inventor passes several other tests as well:<span id="more-13201"></span></p>
<p>1. Right time zone. The original bitcoin postings appeared to come from the Eastern (United States) time zone. Szabo lives near Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>2. Prior to bitcoin, he had similar ideas. As far as I can tell, his previous ideas were the closest of anyone&#8217;s.</p>
<p>3. Yet the original bitcoin proposal didn&#8217;t reference his work. The usual reason for not mentioning a predecessor&#8217;s work is that you want <em>more</em> credit. Yet the creator of bitcoin <em>didn&#8217;t</em> want credit. Failure to mention Szabo&#8217;s work is so strange it may have been Szabo&#8217;s way of telling insiders he&#8217;s the inventor. In other words, this fact makes sense if Szabo is the inventor. It remains unexplained if anyone else is.</p>
<p>4. Szabo failed to get excited when bitcoin emerged. <em>It was based on his work</em> (more or less).<em> </em>Like everyone, <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2012-The-reception-of-my-self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">including me</a>, Szabo had been <a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html" target="_blank">told countless times</a> that his ideas were worthless, crazy, stupid and so on. (&#8220;Money just doesn&#8217;t work like that, I was told fervently and often.&#8221;) Because of that treatment, I greatly enjoy pointing out confirmation of my ideas. It&#8217;s such a fundamental pleasure there&#8217;s a word for it: <em>glee</em>. If he wasn&#8217;t the inventor of bitcoin, Szabo should have gleefully followed its progress, pointing out over and over how this showed his original ideas were right. He didn&#8217;t do this. Again, this makes sense if he was the inventor &#8212; he didn&#8217;t want to draw attention to how close bitcoin is to his published ideas. It remains unexplained if anyone else is.</p>
<p>5. The clincher, for me, is that he wrote <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html" target="_blank">an article about the emergence of money</a> that is compatible with <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">my theory of human evolution</a>. His article says money emerged from collectibles. Collectibles are an important part of my theory. I say they emerged because they helped skilled artisans, who were innovators, make a living. For most people, collectibles are trivial, whereas I&#8217;ve written often about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/willat-effect/" target="_blank">the Willat Effect</a>, which I believe is the psychological rule that created them. It isn&#8217;t easy to be consistent with my theory. I&#8217;ve read dozens of theories about human evolution. Whenever they explain the same things as mine (e.g., evolution of language), they have been inconsistent with my theory. Two examples are Jared Diamond&#8217;s ideas and Daniel Dennett&#8217;s ideas. Szabo&#8217;s essay is the only the second example I have seen of ideas that fit mine. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis" target="_blank">The aquatic ape theory</a>, which is about what happened before the events of my theory, also fits; Szabo&#8217;s ideas are about what happened after the events of my theory. Szabo&#8217;s ideas about the emergence of money are very non-obvious (especially because you have to realize the centrality of collectibles) and are compatible with a theory he cannot have heard of. I doubt anyone agrees with me that compatibility with my theory is a great plus but it is obvious that if you understand how money began, you are in a much better position to invent a new form of money than if you don&#8217;t. The difficulty of mining bitcoins corresponds to the difficulty of making collectibles. You could randomly pick anyone, including cryptographic experts, and the probability would be <em>extremely</em> low they have a good theory of how money began. Yet Szabo does.</p>
<p>I ignore the coincidence of initials: NS and SN (or NS).</p>
<p>Szabo&#8217;s achievement is good news for me because we have a similarity. He was a law professor. They are not supposed to invent new and useful things. No law professor before Szabo invented anything remotely as new and potentially important as bitcoin. I am a psychology professor. They are not supposed to make useful discoveries about health. I have made discoveries/inventions about health that are certainly new and might some day be important, such as the Shangri-La Diet and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf" target="_blank">the underlying theory</a>, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">the effect of morning faces on mood</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114619130176100669530" target="_blank">daily brain testing</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/18/5/1468.long" target="_blank">A 2009 study</a> followed about 9000 men for 10-20 years. It found that strength (how much you can bench and leg press) measured at the start of the study was associated with likelihood of dying of cancer during the study. Men in the upper two-thirds of the study population in strength had 40% less cancer mortality. This might be the most surprising result:</p>
<blockquote><p>Further adjustment for BMI, percent body fat, waist circumference, or cardiorespiratory fitness had little effect on the association. The associations of BMI, percent body fat, or waist circumference with cancer mortality did not persist after further adjusting for muscular strength.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, muscle strength was a better predictor than several similar measures (BMI, etc.) and these other measures stopped predicting when corrected for muscle strength. Muscle strength is closely connected to something important.</p>
<p>Men who are stronger by and large exercise more, no doubt. Yet muscle strength is determined by resistance training, not aerobic exercise &#8212; and it is aerobic exercise (and to some extent walking) that have been promoted by countless experts since the 1960s and the invention of the concept <em>aerobic</em>. Jogging reduces how much time you have for resistance training.</p>
<p>These findings interest me because I do a lot of resistance training &#8212; stand on one leg to exhaustion several times per day &#8212; purely to sleep better. By improving something easy to measure (sleep), these data suggest I have also been improving something hard to measure (chance of dying from cancer). Not surprising, but reassuring.</p>
<p>My data also suggest two different possible reasons for the strength-cancer association. One is that men who exercise more sleep better as a result; better sleep, better immune function, less cancer. Another possibility is that strength is a marker for good sleep. Among men who do equal amounts of exercise, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/30/sleep-and-bedtime-honey-more-about-strength-improvement/" target="_blank">those who sleep better will be stronger</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/books/review/charles-dickens-biographies-review.html?_r=1&amp;nl=books&amp;emc=booksupdateema4&amp;pagewanted=all">a review of biographies of Charles Dickens</a> I found this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1849 he showed a short account of his early years to his close friend John Forster, revealing a story he never told his own family: the shame-inducing months he spent, while his father was in a debtor’s prison, as a 12-year-old “laboring hind” in a factory that bottled shoe-blacking.</p>
<p>Suddenly I understood why he wrote <em>Oliver Twist</em> and why it is so good. Budding writers are told <em>write what you know</em>. They should be told <em>write what you feel bad about</em>.</p>
<p>The work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Pennebaker" target="_blank">James Pennebaker</a> has shown the benefits  of even small amounts of self-disclosure. No doubt this is why all sorts of psychotherapy, supposedly based on enormously different theories, help roughly the same amount: All involve self-disclosure. I see this effect as something built into us by evolution  to increase self-disclosure. Talking about bad experiences helps your listeners avoid what happened to you. To motivate such disclosures, evolution has built into us something that causes us to feel better after we talk this way.</p>
<p>Scientists are not told <em>study what you know </em>and they are <strong>especially</strong> not told <em>study what you feel bad about</em>. Scientists are mostly men, of course, and that sort of thing makes men uncomfortable. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">My personal science</a>, however, suggests the correctness of this idea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One reason personal science is a good idea is it is simple and immediate (in the sense of near). You study one person, you do experiments (easier to interpret than surveys), you can easily repeat the experiment (so you are not confused by secular trends &#8212; big changes over time &#8212; and implausible statistical assumptions), you are aware of unusual events during the experiment (so you are less confused by anomalous results and outliers), you are close to the data collection (so you understand the limits and error rates of the measurements). These elements make good interpretation of your data much easier. Professional science generally lacks some of these elements. For example, the person who writes the paper may not have collected the data. This makes it harder to understand what the data mean.</p>
<p>I hear criticism of (professional) science more now than ten years ago. Lack of replicability, for example. What I rarely hear &#8212; actually, never &#8212; is how often science critics make big blunders. As far as I can tell, as often as those they criticize. This is not to say they are wrong &#8212; who knows. Just overstated.<br />
An example is <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/2/311.full#ref-7" target="_blank">a critique of salt and blood pressure studies</a> I read recently. Many people say salt raises blood pressure. The critique, by Michael Alderman, a professor of epidemiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said, <em>not so fast</em>. The title is: &#8220;Salt, blood pressure and health: a cautionary tale.&#8221; It&#8217;s a good review, with lots of interesting data, but the reviewer, at the same time he is criticizing others, makes a major blunder.</p>
<p>He describes a study in which people were placed on a low-salt diet. Their blood pressure was measured twice, before the diet (Time 1) and after they had been on the diet for quite a while (Time 2). Comparison of the two readings showed a wide range of changes. Some people&#8217;s blood pressure went up, some people&#8217;s blood pressure stayed the same, and some people&#8217;s blood pressure went down. Alderman called this result &#8220;enormous variation between individuals on the effect of salt on pressure&#8221;. Oh no! He assumes that if your blood pressure is different at Time 2 than Time 1, it was because of the change in dietary salt. There are dozens of possible reasons a person&#8217;s blood pressure might differ at the two times (leaving aside measurement error, another possibility). Dozens of things that affect blood pressure were not kept constant.</p>
<p>Had there been a second group that did not change their diet and was also measured at Time 1 and Time 2 &#8212; and had the subjects given the low-salt diet showed a larger spread of Time 2/Time 1 difference scores than the no-change group, then you could reasonably conclude that there was variation in the response to the low-salt diet. To conclude &#8220;enormous variation&#8221; you&#8217;d want to see an enormous increase in difference-score variability. But there was no second group.</p>
<p>This is not some small detail. Alderman actually believes there is great variation in response to salt reduction. It is the main point of his article. <i>Spy</i> magazine had a great column called Review of Reviewers. Such as book and movie reviewers. Unfortunately there is no such thing in science.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the last week I have looked into the possibility that my sleep can be further improved &#8212; in addition to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">the bedtime honey improvement</a> &#8211; by eating a similar amount of sugar (fructose and glucose) a few hours before bedtime. After <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/20/dispatches-from-the-front-lines-of-personal-science-why-did-i-sleep-so-well/" target="_blank">I accidentally slept better than usual</a> (or even better than usual), I tried to determine why. Several things had been unusual the day before. Two tests (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/22/dispatches-from-the-front-lines-of-personal-science-progress-on-why-i-slept-so-well/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/23/front-lines-of-personal-science-more-progress-on-sleep/" target="_blank">here</a>) pointed to the sugar (honey or banana) a few hours before bedtime.</p>
<p>Last night (Christmas Eve) I tried again. I ate a banana (132 g, peeled) about 3 hours (7 pm) before I fell asleep (10 pm). I fell asleep within a minute and woke up, after an apparently dreamless night, feeling perfectly rested. On my 0-100 percentage scale (100% = completely rested, no detectable tiredness), which I have been using for about 8 years, it was the first ever 100%.  I had slept about 6 hours, a good amount of time.</p>
<p>To celebrate, I had a cup of black tea. I didn&#8217;t need it to wake up but I like the taste. I reflected that countless people had drunk tea or coffee to wake up. I had found a better way.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Discovery that an hours-before-bedtime sweet improves sleep (<em>in</em> <em>addition to</em> bedtime honey &#8212; that&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting) is significant not just for the obvious practical reason (better sleep) but also because it is the confirmation of a prediction. After I slept unusually well, I thought of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/20/dispatches-from-the-front-lines-of-personal-science-why-did-i-sleep-so-well/" target="_blank">six possible reasons</a>. The notion that sugar improves sleep pointed to one of them. The results of every test I&#8217;ve done (three nights) have agreed with that prediction. I believe <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5vt0z72k" target="_blank">the only real test of a theory (such as an explanation) is whether it makes correct predictions</a> &#8212; especially, whether it leads to the discovery of new cause-effect relationships. Many things people say haven&#8217;t passed that test. An example is weight control. That low-carb diets cause weight loss has been known since the 1800s. Many explanations have been proposed; not one has made correct predictions, as far as I know. In contrast, <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf" target="_blank">my theory of weight control</a> led me to <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">three new ways to lose weight</a> (sushi, low-glycemic foods, and fructose water).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">I doubt it&#8217;s a placebo effect because the sleep improvement has happened whether I expect it or not. A commenter named Paolo Paiva, after reading my posts about this, realized </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/23/front-lines-of-personal-science-more-progress-on-sleep/" target="_blank">something similar had happened to him</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Today I told my wife how deep I had slept and connected it to the 1 tbspoon of honey and 1 tbspoon of apple cider vinegar mixed with half a cup of water before bed (it tastes really good). Then I saw <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/23/front-lines-of-personal-science-more-progress-on-sleep/" target="_blank">this post</a> and remembered that yesterday I had had banana flour pancakes topped with honey 3 hours before bedtime!</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Paolo. May you continue to sleep well. May the rest of you sleep equally well.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To recap: <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/20/dispatches-from-the-front-lines-of-personal-science-why-did-i-sleep-so-well/" target="_blank">Three days ago I slept extremely well</a>, better than usual. I wondered why. What had made the difference? That day (the day before the night I slept so well) had been different from previous days in at least five ways (e.g., chocolate, new brand of honey). I repeated four of them, and did not sleep better than usual. That suggested the remaining difference &#8212; I had eaten yogurt, blueberries (125 g) and honey (8 g?) a few hours before bedtime &#8212; was responsible. (Every night I had 1 tablespoon &#8212; 20 g &#8212; honey at bedtime. It wasn&#8217;t that.) Then I repeated all five elements, including yogurt, blueberries (125 g) and honey (14 g) two hours before bedtime. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/22/dispatches-from-the-front-lines-of-personal-science-progress-on-why-i-slept-so-well/" target="_blank">I woke up wired</a> (jittery). Very rested, but wired, which wasn&#8217;t pleasant. Too much sugar, perhaps.</p>
<p>The next night I had a banana roughly two hours before bedtime. (In addition, I repeat, to 1 tablespoon honey at bedtime.)  <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1846/2" target="_blank">A banana</a> has about 6 g glucose, 6 g fructose, and 3 g sucrose,  similar to 1 tablespoon honey. I had a strong craving for something sweet at that time, which was new to me &#8212; I almost never eat dessert. In the evening I had more brain power than usual. Yet at bedtime I fell asleep quickly, in about a minute. </p>
<p>The next morning I woke up and felt great. Almost perfectly rested, neither tired nor wired. Even though I&#8217;d only slept 4.7 hours, a bit low for me. It really was the yogurt, blueberries and honey &#8212; almost surely their sugar, which is almost all they have in common with a banana &#8212; that had made me sleep so well.</p>
<p>Conclusion: For the best sleep, have sugar after dinner <strong>and</strong> sugar at bedtime. By sugar I mean a glucose/fructose mixture but for all I know sucrose would work, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html" target="_blank">a graduation speech</a>, Richard Feynman called certain intellectual endeavors &#8220;cargo cult science,&#8221; meaning they had the trappings of science but not the substance. One thing he criticized was rat psychology. He was wrong about that. Sure, as Feynman complained, lots of rat psychology experiments have led nowhere, just as lots of books aren&#8217;t good. But you need to publish lots of bad books to support the infrastructure necessary to publish a few good ones. The same is true of rat psychology experiments. A few are very good. The bad make possible the good. Rat psychology experiments, especially those by Israel Ramirez and Anthony Sclafani, led me to a new theory of weight control, which led me to the Shangri-La Diet.</p>
<p>Cargo cult science does exist.  The most important modern example is evidence-based medicine. Notice how ritualistic it is and how little progress medicine has made since it became popular. An evidence-based medicine review of tonsillectomies <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html" target="_blank">failed to realize they were worse than voodoo</a>. Voodoo, unlike a tonsillectomy, does not damage your immune system. The evidence-based medicine reviewers appeared not to know that tonsils are part of the immune system. Year after year, the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology tells the world, between the lines of the press release, that once again medical researchers have failed to make progress on any major disease, as the prize is always given for work with little or no practical value. In the 1950s, the polio vaccine was progress; so was figuring out that smoking causes lung cancer (which didn&#8217;t get a Nobel Prize). There have been no comparable advances since then. Researchers at top medical schools remain profoundly unaware of what causes heart disease, most cancers, depression, bipolar disorder, obesity, diabetes and so on.</p>
<p>I came across cargo-cult thinking recently in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming" target="_blank">a talk by Neil Gaiman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was in China in 2007, at the first party-approved science fiction and fantasy convention in Chinese history. And at one point I took a top official aside and asked him Why? SF had been disapproved of for a long time. What had changed?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple, he told me. The Chinese were brilliant at making things if other people brought them the plans. But they did not innovate and they did not invent. They did not imagine. So they sent a delegation to the US, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Google, and they asked the people there who were inventing the future about themselves. And they found that all of them had read science fiction when they were boys or girls.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know about Chinese engineers at Microsoft and Google in Beijing. They want to leave the country. An American friend, who worked at Microsoft, was surprised by the unanimity of their desire to leave. I wasn&#8217;t surprised. Why innovate or invent if the government might seize your company? Which is the main point of <em>Why Nations Fail</em>. Allowing science fiction in China doesn&#8217;t change that.</p>
<p>Thanks to Claire Hsu.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://news.patientslikeme.com/press-release/bad-nights-sleep-norm-people-health-conditions-according-patientslikeme-survey" target="_blank">A recent PatientsLikeMe survey</a> found a strong correlation between chronic illness and poor sleep. Here are the most interesting results:</p>
<blockquote><p>PatientsLikeMe survey respondents in the U.S. (n=3,284) . . . are almost nine times more likely to [have] insomnia than the general adult population. . . . PatientsLikeMe members with health conditions experience [each] of the four symptoms of insomnia [= trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, early awakening, and waking up not rested] at twice the rate of the general adult population.</p></blockquote>
<p>This supports my view that bad sleep causes illness. The correlations could have plausibly been the other way (better sleep among survey respondents). People sleep more when sick. Whatever makes sick people sleep more might also make them fall asleep faster and wake up less often.<span id="more-11702"></span></p>
<p>If I slept poorly, I would move heaven and earth to sleep better. (But would never take sleeping pills.) I sleep well, actually, but I still track my sleep and do various experiments to see if I can improve it. For example, recently I was puzzled why I was sleeping less well in Berkeley than in Beijing. One possibility was that my Beijing bedroom was darker than my Berkeley bedroom, even though my Berkeley bedroom was quite dark (e.g., no light from a street lamp). I made my Berkeley bedroom even darker and found my sleep improved. It really was cause and effect. When I made my Berkeley bedroom lighter, my sleep got worse.</p>
<p>My enormous concern with sleep &#8212; nothing matters more for health &#8212; seems to put me in a tiny minority. Even sleep researchers don&#8217;t say bad sleep causes sickness. However, <a href="http://robbwolf.com/" target="_blank">Robb Wolf</a> agrees with me. He has said, &#8220;If someone sleeps poorly it is hard to keep them alive. If someone sleeps well, it is hard to kill them&#8221; &#8212; a good way of putting it. At the recent Ancestral Health Symposium in Atlanta, I asked him where he got this. He said it was based on his experience, meaning his experience working with other people.</p>
<p>My view is heavily based on my experience of my own health. <a href="http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866" target="_blank">Exactly when I greatly improved my sleep, I greatly improved my health.</a> I stopped getting obvious colds. The people around me continued to get them. I hadn&#8217;t expected this. In the research literature I found plenty of support for the idea that better sleep causes better health. An example is that poorer health during the winter seems to be due to less light, not the cold. I am sure morning sunlight improves sleep. Vitamin D has been associated with dozens of measures of health (more Vitamin D, better health). This too may reflect the underlying causality better sleep &#8211;&gt; better health because sunlight increases Vitamin D and improves sleep. That morning Vitamin D improves sleep (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/" target="_blank">Tara Grant&#8217;s great discovery</a>) be important here. Epidemiologists should always measure sleep the way they always measure smoking. Now they almost never do.</p>
<p>Thanks to Richard Sprague.</p>
<p><strong>More </strong>&#8220;Even sleep researchers don&#8217;t say that bad sleep causes illness&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s wrong. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/toll-of-sleep-loss-in-america" target="_blank">an example</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet there&#8217;s strong evidence that lost sleep is a serious matter. The Sleep in America polls and several large studies have linked sleep deficits with poor work performance, driving accidents, relationship problems, and mood problems like anger and depression. A growing list of health risks has been documented in recent studies, too. Heart disease, diabetes, and obesity have all been linked with chronic sleep loss. &#8221;People just don&#8217;t realize how important sleep is, and what the health consequences are of not getting a good night&#8217;s sleep on a regular basis,&#8221; Hunt tells WebMD. &#8220;Sleep is just as important for overall health as diet and exercise.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I should have said sleep researchers don&#8217;t connect good sleep with good immune function, which this quote illustrates. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts,&#8221; said the physicist Richard Feynman <a href="http://www.fotuva.org/feynman/what_is_science.html" target="_blank">in a 1966 talk to high-school science teachers</a>. I think he meant <em>science is the belief in the fallibility of experts</em>. In the talk, he says science education should be about data &#8211;  how to gather data to test ideas and get new ideas &#8212; not about conclusions (&#8220;the earth revolves around the sun&#8221;). And it should be about pointing out that experts are often wrong. I agree with all this.</p>
<p>However, I think the underlying idea &#8212; what Feynman seems to be saying &#8212; is simply wrong. Did Darwin come up with his ideas because he believed experts (the Pope?) were wrong? Of course not. Did Mendel do his pea experiments because he didn&#8217;t trust experts? Again, of course not. Darwin and Mendel&#8217;s work showed that the experts were wrong but that&#8217;s not why they did it. Nor do scientists today do their work for that reason. Scientists are themselves experts. Do they do science to reveal their own ignorance? No, that&#8217;s blatantly wrong. If science is the belief in the ignorance of experts, and X is the belief in the ignorance of scientists, what is X? Our entire economy is based on expertise. I buy my car from experts in making cars, buy my bread from bread-making experts, and so on. The success of our economy teaches us we can rely on experts. Why should high-school science teachers say otherwise? If we can rely on experts, and science rests on the assumption that we can&#8217;t, why do we need scientists? Is Feynman saying experts are wrong 1% of the time, and that&#8217;s why we need science?</p>
<p>I think what Feynman actually meant (but didn&#8217;t say clearly) is <em>science protects us against self-serving experts</em>. If you want to talk about the protection-against-experts function of science, the heart of the matter isn&#8217;t that experts are ignorant or fallible. It is that experts, including scientists, are self-serving. The less certainty in an area, the more experts in that area slant or distort the truth to benefit themselves.  They exaggerate their understanding, for instance. A drug company understates bad side effects. (Calling this &#8220;ignorance&#8221; is too kind.) This is common, non-obvious, and worth teaching high-school students. Science journalists, who are grown ups and should know better, often <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/19/what-goes-unsaid-self-serving-heath-research/?preview=true" target="_blank">completely ignore this</a>. So do other journalists. Science (data collection) is unexpectedly powerful because experts are wrong more often than a naive person would guess. The simplest data collection is to ask for an example.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Genius.html?id=IWQ_y90P2uIC" target="_blank"><em>Genius</em> by James Gleick</a> (a biography of Feynman) was published, I said it should have been titled <em>Genius Manqué</em>. This puzzled my friends. Feynman was a genius, I said, but lots of geniuses have had a bigger effect on the world. I heard Feynman himself describe how he came to invent Feynman diagrams. One day, when he was a graduate student. his advisor, John Wheeler, phoned him. &#8220;Dick,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do you know why all electrons have the same charge? Because they&#8217;re the same electron.&#8221; One electron moves forward and backward in time creating all the electrons we observe. Feynman diagrams came from this idea. <em>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</em> were a big improvement over standard physics books &#8212; more emotional, more vivid, more thought-provoking &#8212; but contain far too little about data, in my opinion. Feynman failed to do what he told high school teachers to do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you have a car that can only turn right. Someone says, <em>Your car turns right too much</em>. You might wonder why they don&#8217;t see the bigger problem (can&#8217;t turn left).</p>
<p>This happens in science today. People complain about how well the car turns right, failing to notice (or at least say) it can&#8217;t turn left. Just as a car should turn both right and left, scientists should be able to (a) test ideas and (b) generate ideas worth testing. Tests are expensive. To be worth the cost of testing, an idea needs a certain plausibility. In my experience, few scientists have clear ideas about how to generate ideas plausible enough to test. The topic is not covered in any statistics text I have seen &#8212; the same books that spend many pages on to how to test ideas.<span id="more-11096"></span></p>
<p>Apparently not noticing the bigger problem, scientists sometimes complain that this or that finding &#8220;fails to replicate&#8221;. My former colleague Danny Kahneman is <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychologists-to-clean-up-their-act-1.11535" target="_blank">an example</a>. He complained that priming effects were not replicating. Implicit in a complaint that Finding X fails to replicate is a complaint about testing. If you complain that X fails to replicate, you are saying that something was wrong with the tests that established X. There is a connection between replication failure and failure to generate ideas worth testing. If you cannot generate new ideas, you are forced to test old ideas. You cannot test an old idea exactly &#8212; that would be boring/repetitive. So you give an old idea a slight tweak and test the variation. For example, someone has shown that X is true in North America. You ask if X is true in South America. You hope you haven&#8217;t tweaked X too much. No idea is true everywhere, except maybe in physics, so as this process continues &#8212; it goes on for decades &#8212; the tested ideas gradually become less true and the experimental effects get weaker. This is what happened in the priming experiments that Kahneman complained about. At the core of priming &#8212; the priming effects studied 30 years ago &#8212; is a true phenomenon. After reading &#8220;doctor&#8221; it becomes easier to decide that &#8220;nurse&#8221; is a word, for example. This was followed by 30 years of drift away from word recognition. Not knowing how to generate new ideas worth testing, social psychologists have ended up studying weak effects (recent priming effects) that are random walks away from strong effects (old priming effects). The weak effects cannot bear the professional weight (people&#8217;s careers rest on them) they are asked to carry and sometimes collapse (&#8220;failure to replicate&#8221;). Sheena Iyengar, a Columbia Business School professor and social psychologist, got a major award (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheena_Iyengar#Awards_and_honors" target="_blank">best dissertation</a>) for and wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Choosing-Sheena-Iyengar/dp/0446504114" target="_blank">a book</a> about a new effect that has turned out to be <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/11/11/more-choice-less-satisfaction/" target="_blank">very close to non-existent</a>. Inability to generate ideas &#8212; to understand how to do so &#8212; means that what appear to be new ideas (not just variations of old ideas) are more likely to be mistakes. I have no idea whether Iyengar&#8217;s original effect was true or not. I am sure, however, that it was weak and made little sense.</p>
<p>Statistics textbooks ignore the problem. They say nothing about how to generate ideas worth testing. I haven&#8217;t asked statisticians about this, but they might respond in one of two ways: 1. <em>That&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s problem</em>. Statistics is about what to do with data after you gather it. That makes as much sense as teaching someone how to land a plane but not how to take off. 2. <em>That&#8217;s what exploratory data analysis is for</em>. <span style="font-size: 13px;">If I said &#8220;E</span>xploratory data analysis can only identify effects of factors that the researcher decided to vary or track. Which is expensive. What about other factors?&#8221;<span style="font-size: 13px;"> they&#8217;d be baffled, I believe. In my experience, </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">exploratory data analysis = full analysis of your data. </em><span style="font-size: 13px;">(Many people do only a small fraction, such as 10%, of all reasonable analyses of their data.) Full analysis is better than partial analysis, but calling it a way to find new ideas fails to understand that professional scientists study the same factors over and over. </span></p>
<p>I suppose many scientists feel the gap acutely. I did. I became interested in self-experimentation most of all because it generated new ideas at a much higher rate (per year) than my professional experiments with rats. I had no idea why, at first, but as it kept happening &#8212; my self-experimentation <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">generated one new idea after another</a>. I came to believe that by accident I was doing something &#8220;right&#8221;. I was doing something that fit a general rule of how to generate ideas, even though I didn&#8217;t know what the general rule was.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">T</span><span style="font-size: 13px;">he sciences I know about (psychology and nutrition) have great trouble coming up with new ideas. The paleo movement is a response to stagnation in the field of nutrition. The Shangri-La Diet shows what a new idea looks like in the area of weight control. The failure of nutritionists to study fermented foods is ongoing. Stagnation in psychology can be seen in the fact that antidepressants remain heavily prescribed, many years after the introduction of Prozac (</span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">my work on morning faces and mood</a><span style="font-size: 13px;"> suggests a much different approach), lack of change in treatments for bipolar disorder over the last 50 years (again, my morning-faces work suggests another approach), and in the failure of social psychologists to discover any big new effects in the last ten years. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the secret to idea generation: <em>Cheaper tests</em>. To find ideas plausible enough to be worth testing with Test X, you need a way of testing ideas that is cheaper than Test X. The cheaper your test, the larger the region of cause-effect space you can explore. Let&#8217;s say Test Y is cheaper than Test X. With Test Y, you can explore more of cause-effect space than you can explore with Test X. In the region unexplored by Test X, you can find points (cause-effect relationships) that pass Test Y. They are worth testing with Test X. My self-experimentation generated new ideas worth testing with more expensive tests because it was much cheaper than existing tests. Via self-experimentation, I could test many ideas too implausible or too expensive to be tested conventionally. Even cheaper than a self-experiment was simply monitoring myself &#8212; tracking my sleep, for example. Again and again, this generated ideas worth testing via self-experimentation. I did what all scientists should do: use cheaper tests to generate ideas worth testing with more expensive tests.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/08/24/more-about-wild-fermented-wines/?preview=true" target="_blank">a recent post</a>, I said a well-functioning system will produce both optimality and complexity. I meant important systems like our bodies, economies, and formal education. If you look at <a href="http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes" target="_blank">the nutrition advice provided by the United States Department of Agriculture</a> &#8212; the food pyramid, the food plate, the recommended daily allowances, and the associated reports &#8212; you will find nothing that increases the complexity of metabolism inside our bodies (in particular, the diversity of metabolic pathways). The advice is all optimality &#8212; for example, the best amounts of various micronutrients. The people behind the USDA advice, reflecting the thinking of the best nutrition scientists in the world, utterly fail to grasp the importance of complexity. Half of nutrition research &#8212; or more than half, since the topic has been so neglected &#8212; should be about how to increase internal complexity. In practice, almost none of it is. It&#8217;s obvious, I think, that the microbes within us are very important for health. They are mostly in our intestines and must be heavily influenced by what we eat. How did they get there? How can their number be increased? How can their diversity be increased?</p>
<p>The absence is especially striking because the point is so simple. To solve actual problems, you need both optimality and complexity. Showers &#8212; what we use to take a shower &#8212; provide an example. You want to adjust the water temperature. If you try to do this while taking a shower, it can be hard because of the delay between changing the hot/cold water proportions and feeling the effects. It is better to use the bathtub (lower) tap to set the temperature (measuring it with your wrist) and only after you&#8217;ve optimized the temperature, shift the water to the shower head. The bathtub tap produces simple output (a single stream of water) that is easy to optimize. The shower head produces more complex output that is harder to optimize but does a better job of washing (an actual problem). You need both bathtub tap (for optimization) and shower head (for complexity) to do a good job solving the problem. Likewise, we need both an understanding of necessary nutrients (Vitamin A, etc.), which can be optimized, and an understanding of microbes, which cannot be optimized but can be made more complex, to make good decisions about what food to eat. Ordinary food is the hardware, you might say; and microbes are the software.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his interview with me about <em>The Truth in Small Doses</em> (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/08/09/the-truth-in-small-doses-interview-with-clifton-leaf-part-1-of-2/" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/08/10/the-truth-in-small-doses-interview-with-clifton-leaf-part-2-of-2/?preview=true" target="_blank">Part 2</a>), Clifton Leaf praised <em>Racing to the Beginning of the Road</em> (1996) by Robert Weinberg. &#8220;A masterful job . . . the single best book on cancer,&#8221; wrote Leaf. In an email, he continued:<span id="more-11171"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>In Chapter 3 of &#8220;Racing to the Beginning of the Road,&#8221; Weinberg goes through much of the early epidemiological work linking tobacco to smoking (John Hill, Percivall Pott, Katsusaburo Yamagiwa, Richard Doll), but then focuses on the story of Ernst Wynder, who just happens to be one of Weinberg&#8217;s cousins. [As a medical student, Wynder found a strong correlation between smoking and lung cancer.] Building on his own prior epidemiological work, and that of many others, Wynder actually built an experimental &#8220;smoking machine&#8221; at the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York in the early 1950s. The machine collected the tar from cigarette smoke (and later, the condensate from the smoke) and Wynder used those to produce skin cancers in mice and rabbits. But the amazing part of the story is what happened later&#8230;with Wynder&#8217;s bosses at Sloan-Kettering and with one of the legendary figures in cancer research, Clarence Cook Little. I don&#8217;t want to give the story away. (If you have the time, you really would love reading the book.) But it&#8217;s one of the most damning stories of scientific interference I&#8217;ve read.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wynder met a lot of opposition. His superiors at Sloan-Kettering required that his papers be okayed by his boss, who disagreed with his conclusions. Clarence Cook Little, according to Weinberg, made the following arguments:</p>
<blockquote><p>The greater rates of lung cancer in smokers only gave evidence of a correlation, but hardly proved a causal connection. One&#8217;s credulity had to be strained to accept the ability of a single agent [he means smoking] to cause lung cancer along with so many other diseases including bronchitis, emphysema, coronary artery disease, and a variety of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, bladder and kidney. After all, many of these diseases existed long before people started smoking.</p></blockquote>
<p>A little masterpiece of foolishness . . . and more reason to never ever say <em>correlation does not equal causation</em>. Little was at one point <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._C._Little" target="_blank">President of the University of Michigan</a>. Later he worked for the tobacco industry. It wasn&#8217;t just Little. Weinberg says that Wynder&#8217;s colleagues complained about his &#8220;statistical analyses and experimental protocols, which they found to be less than rigorous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weinberg says little about epidemiology in the rest of the book &#8212; which, to be fair, is about the laboratory study of cancer. At the very end of the book, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We learned much about how cancer begins; it is no longer a mystery. We will surely learn more . . . but the major answers already rest firmly in our hands. . . . No, we have still not found the cure. But after so long, we know where to look.</p></blockquote>
<p>The claim that &#8220;we know where to look&#8221; is not supported by examples. And Weinberg says nothing about prevention.</p>
<p>Weinberg&#8217;s book reminded me of a new-music concert I attended at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Hard to listen to (non-melodic, etc.) like lots of new non-popular music. I didn&#8217;t enjoy it, but surely the composer did &#8212; this was fascinating. <i>How did it happen?</i> I wondered. Weinberg describes a great deal of research that has so far produced little practical benefit. Weinberg, it seems, has managed to avoid being bothered by this &#8212; if he even notices it. How did this happen?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s &#8220;bad&#8221; or wrong or undesirable to do science with no practical benefit, just as I don&#8217;t complain about &#8220;unlistenable&#8221; music. Plenty of &#8220;useless&#8221; science has ultimately proved useful, but the transition from useless to useful can take hundreds of years, which is why there must be &#8220;scaffolding,&#8221; sources of support other than practicality. This is why scientists use the word <i>elegant</i> so much. Their enjoyment of &#8220;elegance&#8221; is scaffolding. Long before &#8220;useless&#8221; science, there was &#8220;useless&#8221; decoration (and nowadays there is &#8220;unlistenable&#8221; music). Thorstein Veblen showed no sign of understanding that the &#8220;waste&#8221; he mocked made possible exploration of the unknown, which is necessary for progress. (By supporting artisans, such as the artisans who make decorations, we support their research.) What <strong>is</strong> undesirable is when someone (like Wynder) manages to do something useful, to foolishly criticize it, as Little and Wynder&#8217;s colleagues did.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Cholesterol-The-Importance-Sun/dp/0956213200" target="_blank"><em>Vitamin D and Cholesterol: The Importance of the Sun</em></a> (2009) by David Grimes, a British doctor, contains more than a hundred graphs and tables. Most of the book is about heart disease.  Grimes argues that a great deal of heart disease is due to too little Vitamin D, usually due to too little sunlight. I recently blogged about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/07/the-rise-and-fall-of-heart-disease/" target="_blank">other work by Dr. Grimes</a> &#8212; about the rise and fall of heart disease.</p>
<p>Part of the book is about problems with the cholesterol hypothesis (high cholesterol causes heart disease).  One study found that in men aged 56-65, there was no relationship between death rate and cholesterol level over the next thirty years, during which almost all of them died (Figure 29.2). There <em>is</em> a positive correlation between death rate and cholesterol level for younger men (aged 31-39). The same pattern is seen with women, except that women 60 years or older show the &#8220;wrong&#8221; correlation: women in the <em>lowest</em> quartile of cholesterol level have by far the <em>highest</em> death rate (Figure 29.5). A female friend of mine in England, who is almost 60, was recently told by her doctor that her cholesterol is dangerously high.</p>
<p>The book was inspired by Grimes&#8217; discovery of a correlation between latitude and heart disease: People who lived further north had more heart disease. This association is clear in the UK, for example (Figure 32.4). Controlling for latitude, he found a correlation between hours of sunshine and heart disease rate (Table 32.3): Towns with more sunshine had less heart disease. No doubt you&#8217;ve heard that dietary fat causes heart disease. In the famous Seven Countries study, there was indeed a strong correlation between percent calories from fat and heart disease death rate (Figure 30.2). You haven&#8217;t heard that in the same study there was a strong correlation between latitude and dietary fat intake (Figure 30.8): People in the north ate more fat than people in the south. The fat-heart disease correlation in that study could easily be due to a connection between latitude and heart disease. The correlation between latitude and heart disease, on the other hand, persists when diet is controlled for.</p>
<p>Grimes convinced me that the latitude/sunshine correlation with heart disease reflects something important. It is large, appears in many different contexts, and has resisted explanation via confounds. Maybe sunshine reduces heart disease by increasing Vitamin D, as Grimes argues, or maybe by improving sleep &#8212; the more sunshine you get, the deeper (= better) your sleep. Sleep is enormously important in fighting off infection, and a variety of data suggest that heart disease has a microbial aspect. As long-time readers of this blog know, I take Vitamin D3 at a fixed time (8 am) every morning, thereby improving my Vitamin D status <strong>and</strong> <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/" target="_blank">improving my sleep</a>.</p>
<p>Grimes and his book illustrate <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/01/24/not-the-same-study-section-how-the-truth-comes-out/" target="_blank">my insider/outsider rule</a>: To make progress, you need to be close enough to the subject (enough of an insider) to have a good understanding but far enough away (enough of an outsider) to be able to speak the truth. As a doctor, Grimes is close to the study of disease etiology. However, he&#8217;s a gastroenterologist, not a cardiologist or epidemiologist. This allows him to say whatever he wants about the cause of heart disease. He won&#8217;t be punished for heretical ideas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I interviewed two job candidates for an assistant professor position at Tsinghua. I asked both of them: &#8220;Why did you decide to study this?&#8221; (this = their field of research). One had no answer at all. The other had an answer that didn&#8217;t make sense. I didn&#8217;t mean it as a tough question. If they had said &#8220;because that&#8217;s what they were doing where I got a postdoc&#8221; I would have been perfectly happy. If that were the answer, I might have asked &#8220;why does your advisor study it?&#8221; &#8212; to which &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; would have been perfectly acceptable. Of course, there are better answers.</p>
<p>When I was a graduate student, I read <em>Adventures of a Mathematician</em> by Stanislaw Ulam (a very good well-written book). One of the book&#8217;s comments impressed me: That John Von Neumann was able to distinguish the main lines of growth of the tree of mathematics from the branches. <span style="font-size: 13px;">My research was about how rats measure time. The relevance to big questions in the psychology of learning wasn&#8217;t obvious. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">I wondered: </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">Am I studying something important? Or something that will be irrelevant in twenty years?</em><span style="font-size: 13px;"> My advisor didn&#8217;t seem to have thought about this. </span></p>
<p>When I interviewed for jobs at various universities, no one asked me <em>why do you study this?</em> But it was still a question worth answering. As a grad student I had no choice. But eventually I would have a choice: I could continue to study how rats measure time. Or I could study something else. (Eventually I did change &#8212; to studying what controls variation in behavior.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I would say now about how to choose a research topic.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s best is a new method. If you can use a new method to answer questions in your field, do that. The cheaper, easier and more available the method, the better. As a graduate student, I developed <a href="http://www08.homepage.villanova.edu/michael.brown/Psych%208175/Roberts1981.pdf" target="_blank">a new way to study how rats measure time</a>, which I called the peak procedure. It made it easier to determine if an experimental treatment affected an animal&#8217;s internal clock.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s second best is a new experimental effect. Discovering a new way to change something of interest. The bigger, cheaper, newer, and more surprising the effect, the better. Using the peak procedure, my colleagues and I discovered <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/about/2006_variation_of_bar_press_duration.pdf" target="_blank">a large and surprising effect</a> (at a certain time during the peak procedure, the variability of bar-press duration &#8212; how long a rat holds down the bar when pressing it &#8212; became much larger). When I first saw the result, I assumed it was due to a software mistake. It turned out to be a window in what controls the variability of behavior &#8212; an easy way of studying that. In that sense it was also a new method.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if the two job candidates I interviewed were doing either of these two things. Maybe not. My broader point is that if you don&#8217;t have a good understanding of how to choose a research topic you will have to retreat to studying something simply because others are studying it. Which is exactly the wrong thing to do if you want to be an innovator and a leader.</p>
