				<small>Tuesday, June 7th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Law">Conway&#8217;s Law</a> is the observation that the structure of a product will reflect the structure of the organization that designed it. If the organization has three parts, so will the product. In <a href="http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html">the original paper</a> (1968), Conway put it like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a  design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#8217;s communication  structure.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A contract research  organization had eight people who were to produce a COBOL and an ALGOL  compiler. After some initial estimates of difficulty and time, five  people were assigned to the COBOL job and three to the ALGOL job. The  resulting COBOL compiler ran in five phases, the ALG0L compiler ran in  three.</p>
<p>A consumer &#8212; someone outside the organization who uses the product &#8212; wants the <strong>best </strong>design. Conway&#8217;s Law implies they are unlikely to get it.</p>
<p>I generalize Conway&#8217;s Law like this: <strong>It is hard for people with jobs to innovate &#8212; for reasons that outsiders know nothing about. Whereas persons without jobs have total freedom</strong>. An example is a politician who promises change but fails to deliver. The promises of change are plausible to outsiders (voters) so they elect the politician. However, being outsiders, they barely understand how government works. When the promised changes don&#8217;t happen, the voters are &#8220;disillusioned&#8221;.</p>
<p>To me, the most interesting application of the generalized law is to science. In my experience, people who complain about &#8220;bad science&#8221;, such as <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=an-epidemic-of-false-claims">John Ioannides</a> and <a href="http://www.badscience.net/">Ben Goldacre</a>, have the same incomplete view of the world as the &#8220;disillusioned&#8221; voters. They fail to grasp the constraints involved. They fail to consider that the science they are criticizing may be the best those professional scientists can produce, given the system within which they work. Better critiques would look at the constraints the professional scientists are under, the reasons for those constraints, and how those constraints might be overcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much research is conducted for reasons other than the pursuit of  truth,&#8221; writes Ioannidis. Well, yes &#8212; people with jobs want to keep  them and get promoted. They want to appear high status. That&#8217;s not going to change. It&#8217;s absolutely true that drug company  scientists slant the evidence to favor their company&#8217;s  drug, as Irving Kirsch explains in <a href="http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev488.htm"><em>The Emperor&#8217;s New Drugs</em></a>. But if you don&#8217;t understand what causes depression and you&#8217;re  trying to produce a new anti-depressant and you want to keep your job . .  . things get difficult. The core problem is lack of understanding. Lack  of understanding makes innovation difficult. Completely failing to  understand this, Ioannidis recommends something that would <strong>discourage </strong>new  ideas: &#8220;We must routinely demand robust and extensive external  validation—in the  form of additional studies—for any report that claims  to have found  something new.&#8221;</p>
<p>Truly &#8220;bad science&#8221; has little to do with what Ioannides or Goldacre or any <a href="http://www.anh-europe.org/news/quackbuster-stephen-barrett-md-loses-appeal-and-leaves-home-town">quackbuster</a> talks about. Truly bad science is derivative science, science that fails to find new answers to major questions, such as the cause of obesity. Failure of innovation isn&#8217;t shown by any one study. Given the rarity of innovation, it is unwise to expect much of any one study. To see lack of innovation clearly you need to look at the whole distribution of innovation. Whether the system is working well or poorly, I think <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf">the distribution of innovation resembles a power law</a>: most studies produce little progress, a tiny number produce large progress. The slope of the distribution is what matters. Bad science = steep downward slope. With bad science, even the most fruitful studies produce only small amounts of innovation.</p>
<p>Just as outsiders expect too much from professionals, they fail to grasp the innovative power of non-professionals. Mendel was not a professional scientist. Darwin was not a professional scientist. Einstein did his best work while a patent clerk. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow_%28physician%29">John Snow</a>, the first person to use data (a graph) to learn the cause of an infection, was a doctor. His job had nothing to do with preventing infection. To improve innovation about health (or anything else), we should give more power to non-professionals, as I argued in <a href="http://www.sethroberts.net/about/2011-05-27_Why_Does_Personal_Science_Matter.ppt">my talk at the First Quantified Self Conference</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For an article about self-experimentation and self-tracking to appear in <em>Men&#8217;s Fitness UK</em> this summer, Mark Bailey sent me several questions.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways have the results of your self-experimentation directly affected your daily life e.g. health / work / lifestyle changes?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Acne</em>. My dermatologist prescribed two medicines. I found that one worked , the other didn&#8217;t.<em> </em></li>
<li><em>Weight</em>. Found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shangri-Diet-Hunger-Anything-Weight-Loss/dp/B0014E92NC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1249187928&amp;sr=8-1">new ways to lose weight</a> (e.g., <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php">nose-clipping</a>).</li>
<li><em>Sleep</em>. Found <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">new ways to sleep more deeply, avoid early awakening</a> (e.g., <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">one-legged standing</a>).</li>
<li><em>Mood, energy, serenity</em>. Found that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">morning faces make me more cheerful, more energetic, and more serene</a>.</li>
<li><em>Productivity</em>. After I started to track when I was working, I  discovered that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=post&amp;category_name=productivity">a certain feedback system </a>made me work more, goof off less.</li>
<li><em>Inflammation</em>. Self-experimentation led me <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">to take flaxseed oil</a>. In the right dose &#8212; which I determined via self-experimentation &#8212; it greatly reduces inflammation. As a result, my gums are pink instead of red. They no longer bleed when I floss.</li>
<li><em>Balance, reflexes</em>. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">Flaxseed oil</a> improved my balance and quickened my reflexes &#8212; I catch what I would have dropped.</li>
<li><em>Blood sugar</em>. I found that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/">walking a lot improves my blood sugar level</a>.</li>
<li><em>Mental clarity</em>. I found that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">flaxseed oil</a> and <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/">butter</a> improve how well my brain works in several ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>Changes 1-6 are/were obvious. The rest are more subtle.</p>

					<p>You have surely heard the phrase <em>economies of scale</em> &#8212; meaning that when you make many copies of something each instance costs less than when you make only a few copies. Large companies are said to benefit from &#8220;economies of scale&#8221; &#8212; so there is pressure to become bigger. Every introductory economics textbook says something like this. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/05/08/what-the-phrase-economies-of-scale-reveals-about-economics/#more-2707" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Wednesday, May 4th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Darwin was an insider/outsider; so was Mendel. Insider/outsiders are close enough to their subject to have a good understanding and skills yet far enough away to have freedom. In the case of Chinese history, <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2010/dec/20/finding-facts-about-maos-victims/">a journalist named Yang Jisheng has filled that role</a>. He wrote a book called <em>Tombstone (Mubei) </em>about the Great Famine (1958-61). He was able to write what professional historians could not:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Why are you the first Chinese historian to tackle this subject seriously?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Traditional historians [i.e., college professors] face restrictions. First of all, they censor  themselves. Their thoughts limit them. They don’t even dare to write the  facts, don’t dare to speak up about it, don’t dare to touch it. And  even if they wrote it, they can’t publish it. And if they publish, they  will face censure. So mainstream scholars face those restrictions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But there are many unofficial historians like me. Many people are  writing their own memoirs about being labeled “Rightists” or  “counter-revolutionaries.” There is an author in Anhui province who has  described how his family starved to death. There are many authors who  have written about how their families starved.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they publish, they will face censure.&#8221; With respect to weight control, I am an insider/outsider. When I published <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>, I did not expect censure. My colleagues (other psychology department faculty)  wouldn&#8217;t care what I wrote about a different subject. To my surprise, I <em>was </em>censured &#8212; maybe a better word is <em>denounced</em> &#8212; by a nutrition education lecturer in the UC Berkeley Nutrition Department.  The woman who denounced me had not seen my book. Based on what a reporter told her, she expressed her opinion of it in an email she sent to twenty people in her department and the chairman of my department. It said, in part:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I did give the SF Chronicle reporter my opinion of the diet making these points:<br />
- one cannot possibly meet nutrient needs on 1200 kcals per day<br />
- sugar and oils are not nutrient dense; they are calorically dense and  thus dilute the nutrient density of the total kcal intake.<br />
- 1200 kcals per day is less than the semi-starvation diet used in the  only published formal study ever conducted in this country on human  starvation (Ancel Keys, 1950)<br />
- human semi-starvation is not a path to health whether one is discussing physical, psychological, or social well-being<br />
- the results of single subject research are applicable only to that subject; they cannot be generalized to others.<br />
- I cannot recommend this diet, in fact, I recommend against it.</p>
<p>In other words: Ridiculous. Her many misconceptions (e.g., she is unaware of many examples of path-breaking self-experimentation in the field of nutrition)  aren&#8217;t terribly interesting. What&#8217;s fascinating is her decision to trash a book she hasn&#8217;t read to a large number of her colleagues.</p>

				<small>Friday, March 25th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A few days ago I described an experiment that found <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">standing on one leg improved my sleep</a>. Four/day (= right leg twice, left leg twice) was better than three/day or two/day. I didn&#8217;t know that. For a long time I&#8217;d done two/day.<br />
I think the results also contain more subtle lessons. At the level of raw methodology, I found that context didn&#8217;t matter. The effect of four/day was nearly the same when (a) I measured that effect using four days in a randomized design (where the dose for each day is randomly chosen from two, three, and four) and when (b) I measured that effect using a dose of four day after day. Suppose I want to compare three and four. Which design should I use: (a) 3333344444, (b) 3434343434, or (c) 4433343434 (randomized)? The results suggest it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>The experiment didn&#8217;t take long (a few months) but it took me a long time to begin. I noticed the effect behind it (one-legged standing improves sleep) two years ago. Why did I wait so long to do an experiment about details?</p>
<p>I was already collecting the data (on paper) &#8212; writing down how long I slept, rating how rested I felt, etc. But I wasn&#8217;t entering that data in my laptop. To transfer months of data into my laptop required motivation. Most of my self-experimentation has been motivated by the possibility of  big improvements &#8212; much less acne, much better mood, and so on. That  wasn&#8217;t possible here. I slept well, night after night.</p>
<p>What broke the equilibrium of doing nothing? A growing sense of loss. I knew I was throwing away something by <strong>not</strong> doing experiments (= doing roughly the same thing day after day). The longer I did nothing, the more I lost. To say this in an extreme way: I had discovered a way to improve sleep that was unconnected to previous work &#8212; sleep experts haven&#8217;t heard of anything like it. It was real progress. To fail to figure out details was like finding a whole new place and not looking around. Moreover, the experiments wouldn&#8217;t even be difficult. The treatment takes less than a day and you measure its effect the next morning. This is much easier than lots of research. Suppose you know that radioactivity is bad and you discover something radioactive in your house. A sane person would move that radioactive thing as far away as possible &#8212; minimizing the harm it does. I had discovered something beneficial yet wasn&#8217;t trying to maximize the benefits. Crazy!</p>
<p>An early lesson I learned about experimentation is to run each condition much longer than might seem necessary. If you think a condition should last a week, do it for a month. Things will turn out to be more complicated than you think, having more data will help you deal with the additional complexity that turns up. Now it was clear I had gone too far in the direction of passivity. I did the experiment, it was helpful, I could have done it a year ago.</p>

					<p>At the Quantified Self blog, Alexandra Carmichael has posted <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/03/the-state-of-quantified-self-a-year-of-growth/">several graphs showing how much the Quantified Self movement has grown during the past year</a>. The number of QS meetup members has grown by a factor of 3; the number of groups has grown by a factor of 6.</p>
<p>Measuring yourself is a step toward controlling yourself &#8212; especially, controlling your health and well-being. Almost everyone wants more control of these things. I believe that the idea, which the Quantified Self movement encourages, that ordinary people can do useful science is a shift with implications on the order of the shift from religion (the Sun revolves around the Earth) to science (the Earth revolves around the Sun). When ordinary people begin to do science, I predict we will learn a lot more about how to control our bodies.</p>
<p>Before science became powerful, people knew lots of correct useful stuff (e.g., metallurgy). But there were limits on what could be learned (e.g., Galileo was imprisoned). Now religion is much less powerful but most people believe that science can only be done by certain people (e.g., professors). This too places serious limits on what can be learned. For control of the outside world (e.g., material science, physics), I don&#8217;t think these limits matter (although<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDJNCIr2-JM&#038;NR=1"> the case of Starlight</a> suggests that even here amateurs can make important discoveries). But for control of the inner world (our bodies), the message of my work is that these limits matter a lot. By studying myself I managed to learn a bunch of useful things that professional scientists could learn only with great difficulty. For example, I could learn from accidents how to sleep better; I could easily test ideas about how to sleep better. Few if any professional sleep researchers measure sleep night after night for long periods of time; nor do they do cheap fast experiments.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/02/16/revolution_u?page=full">This</a> is the best magazine article I have read in a long time. The subtitle is &#8220;What Egypt Learned from the Students Who Overthrew Milosevic&#8221;, a good description. The Serbian students who overthrew Milosevic had several lessons for budding revolutionaries in other countries, such as Egypt and Burma. One was/is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do a small thing and if it is successful, you have the confidence to do another one and another one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much like <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5bv8c7p3">my advice about science</a>: <strong>Do the smallest easiest thing that will tell you something</strong>. You will learn more from it than you expect. If someone criticizes a study for being &#8220;small&#8221; they are saying &#8220;1 + 1 = 3&#8243;. If someone does a large study that fails, they are saying the same thing.</p>

					<p>The first Quantified Self (QS) Meetup group met in Kevin Kelly&#8217;s house near San Francisco in 2008. I was there; so was <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com">Tim Ferriss</a>. Now <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">there are 19 QS groups</a>, as distant as Sydney and Cape Town.</p>
<p>I believe this is the beginning of a movement that will greatly improve human health. I think QS participants will discover, as I did, that simple experiments can shed light on how to be healthy &#8212; experiments that mainstream researchers are unwilling or unable to do. Echoing Jane Jacobs, I&#8217;ve said <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/05/02/how-could-they-know-the-case-of-healthy-gums/">farmers didn&#8217;t invent tractors</a>. That&#8217;s not what farmers do, nor could they do it. Likewise, mainstream health researchers, such as medical school professors, are unable to greatly improve their research methods. That&#8217;s not what they do, nor could they do it. They have certain methodological skills; they apply them over and over. To understand the limitations of those methods would require a broad understanding of science that few health researchers seem to have. (For example, many health researchers dismiss correlations because &#8220;correlation does not equal causation.&#8221; In fact, correlations have been extremely important clues to causality.) Big improvements in health research will never come from people who make their living doing health research, just as big improvements in farming have never come from farmers. That&#8217;s where QS comes in.</p>
<p>The first QS conference is May 28-29. <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/conference/">Tickets are still available</a>.</p>

					<p>After referring to Jane Jacobs (&#8220;successful city neighborhoods need a mixture of old and new buildings&#8221;), which I liked, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c5698552-aa31-11df-9367-00144feabdc0.html">Tim Harford wrote this</a>, which I didn&#8217;t like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many medical treatments (and a few social policies) have been tested by randomized trials. It is hard to imagine a more clear-cut practice of  denying treatment to some and giving it to others. Yet such lotteries &#8212;  proper lotteries, too &#8212; are the foundation of much medical progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The notion of evidence-based medicine was a step forward in that it recognized that evidence mattered. It was only a small step forward, however, because its valuation of evidence &#8212; on a single dimension, with double-blind randomized trials at the top &#8212; was naive. Different sorts of decisions need different sorts of evidence, just as Jacobs said different sorts of businesses need different sorts of buildings. In particular, new ideas need cheap tests, just as new businesses need cheap rent. As an idea becomes more plausible, it makes sense to test it in more expensive ways. That is one reason a monoculture of evidence is a poor idea.</p>
<p>Another is that you should learn from the past. Sometimes a placebo effect is plausible; sometimes it isn&#8217;t. To ignore this and insist everything should be placebo-controlled is to fail to learn a lot you could have learned.</p>
<p>A third reason a monoculture of evidence is a poor idea is that it ignores mechanistic understandings &#8212; understanding of what causes this or that problem. In some cases, you may think that the disorder you are studying has a single cause (e.g., scurvy). In other cases, you may think the problem probably has several causes (e.g., depression, often divided into endogenous and exogenous). In the latter case, it is plausible that a treatment will help only some of those with the problem. So you should design your study and analyze your data taking into account that possibility. You may want to decide for each subject whether or not the treatment helped rather than lump all subjects together. And the &#8220;best&#8221; designs will be those that best allow you to do this.</p>

					<p>In a comment on <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6979.full">a BMJ paper critical of alternative medicine</a> (the author submitted a fictional abstract to a conference then criticized the program committee for not rejecting it), <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6979.full/reply#bmj_el_246263">a retired chemist named Joe Magrath said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The scientific literature tells us that acupuncture, cupping and reflexology are all nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t looked into it but I&#8217;ll take his word for it.</p>
<p>Around the time Magrath said that, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/12/what-could-possibly-go-wrong/68618/">James Fallows said this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>During our years in Malaysia in the 1980s, and more recently in China,  my wife and I became unlikely converts to a lot of Asian medical  practices. I had serious back pain cured by an acupuncturist (who used  needles the size of aluminum baseball bats) in Kuala Lumpur. In <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dreaming-Chinese-Discovering-Billion-People/dp/1906021554">her book</a>, my wife describes how the gruesome-seeming therapy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_cupping">fire-cupping</a>,  applied in an all-night massage parlor in the city of Yueyang, snapped  her out of a serious bout of the flu. Sure, she had big red welts on her  back for the next ten days, but her fever was gone!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/12/09/the-decline-effect/">A few posts ago</a> I commented on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer">Jonah Lehrer&#8217;s article about replication difficulties</a>, which Lehrer called <em>the decline effect</em>. I concluded it was an indication how poorly science (truth-seeking) and profession (making a living) fit together. Scientists are always under pressure to do what&#8217;s good for their career rather than find and report the truth.</p>
<p>Journalism is another kind of truth-seeking. It has the same problem. Journalists are always under pressure to do what&#8217;s good for their career rather than find and report the truth. In <a href="http://www.theamericanscholar.org/unauthorized-but-not-untrue/">an essay about unauthorized biographies</a>, Kitty Kelley makes this point:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Michael] Hastings said that reporters like [Lara] Logan do not report negative stories  about their subjects in order to assure continued access. No reporter  would admit to tilting a story toward favorable coverage to keep entrÃ©e,  but they do, and that is one of the dirty little secrets of journalism  today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as no reporter admits this, I have never heard a scientist admit it, with two exceptions: 1. The inventor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis">the aquatic ape theory of human evolution</a> (Alister Hardy) said he stopped talking about it to avoid hurting his career. It fell to a non-scientist (Elaine Morgan) to develop it. 2. In <a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm">that famous graduation speech</a>, Richard Feynman pointed out how the first determination of the charge on an electron used the wrong value for the viscosity of air and later determinations, which did not involve that viscosity, tended to confirm the mistaken value. Unfortunately, Feynman went on to say: &#8220;We&#8217;ve learned those tricks nowadays, and now we don&#8217;t have that kind of a disease.&#8221; As if human nature had changed.</p>
<p>I conclude that both science and journalism will work best with systems where amateurs and professionals both have substantial power. Kelley doesn&#8217;t mention that authorized biographers have important truth-seeking advantages over non-authorized ones (e.g., access to old letters).</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer">A new article in <em>The New Yorker</em> by Jonah Lehrer</a> is about declines in the size of experimental or quasi-experimental effects over time. For example, Jonathan Schooler, an experimental psychologist, found that if subjects are asked to describe a face soon after seeing it their later memory for the face is worse. As Schooler continued to study the effect, it appeared to get weaker. The article also describes examples from drug trials (a anti-psychotic drug appeared to become weaker over 15 years) and ecology (the effect of male symmetry on mating success got weaker over years).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to see an ambitious unconventional article. I blogged a few weeks ago about <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/11/11/more-choice-less-satisfaction/">difficulties replicating the too-many-choices effect</a>. Difficulty of replication and the decline effect are the same thing. I could do what Jared Diamond does in <em>Collapse</em>: give a list of five or six reasons why this happens. (Judging by <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/BoZo/jennions/publications/Paper33.pdf">this paper</a>, the effect, although real, is much weaker than you&#8217;d guess from Lehrer&#8217;s article.) For example, the initial report has much more flexibility of data analysis than later reports. Flexibility of analysis allows researchers to increase the size of effects.</p>
<p>A long list of reasons would miss a larger point (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/04/25/jane-jacobs-and-collapse-continued/">as Diamond does</a>). A larger point is this: Science (search for truth) and profession (making a living) are not a good fit. In a dozen ways, the demands of a scientist&#8217;s job get in the way of finding and reporting truth. You need to publish, get a grant, please your colleagues, and so on. Nobody pays you for finding the truth. If that is a goal, it is several goals from the top of the list. Most jobs have customers. If a wheelwright made a bad wheel, it broke. Perhaps he had to replace it or got a bad reputation. There was fast powerful feedback. In science, feedback is long-delayed or absent. Only long after you have been promoted may it become clear anything was wrong with the papers behind your promotion. The main customers for science are other scientists. The pressure to have low standards &#8212; and thus appear better to promotion committees and non-scientists &#8212; is irresistible. Whereas if Wheelwright Y makes better wheels than Wheelwright X, customers may notice and Wheelwright Y may benefit.</p>
<p>There are things about making science a job that push scientists <strong>toward </strong>the truth as well, such as more money and time. When science is a job, a lot more research gets done. Fine. But how strong are the forces against finding truth? I was never surprised by the replication difficulties Lehrer writes about. I had heard plenty of examples, knew there were many reasons it happened. But I was stunned by the results of my self-experimentation. I kept finding stuff (e.g., breakfast disturbs sleep, butter improves brain function) that contradicted the official line (breakfast is the most important meal of the day, butter is dangerous). Obviously I had a better tool (self-experimentation) for finding things out. The shock was how many things that had supposedly been found out were wrong. Slowly I realized how much pressure career demands place on scientists. It is no coincidence that the person most responsible for debunking man-made global warming, Stephen McIntyre, is not a professional climatologist (or a professional scientist in any other area). Unlike them, he can say whatever he wants.</p>

<p><strong>More</strong> In his blog, failing to see the forest for the trees, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/12/the-mysterious-decline-effect/">Lehrer says</a> we must still believe in climate change (presumably man-made): climate change and evolution by natural selection &#8220;have been verified in thousands of different ways by thousands of different scientists working in many different fields.&#8221; Charles Darwin, like McIntyre, was an amateur, and therefore could say whatever he wanted.</p>

					<p>My Frontiers of Psychology class read Daryl Bem&#8217;s new paper <a href="http://dbem.ws/FeelingFuture.pdf"><em>Feeling the Future</em></a> that reports nine experiments that show an effect of the future on the present. I have a different take than anything I&#8217;ve read: I think there are several good reasons to take it seriously. But in this post let&#8217;s start with how it could have been better:</p>
<p>1. <em>Lack of background</em>. There have been lots of experiments along these lines. What did they show? This question is not clearly answered. The prior probability of these claims is enormously important. As I told my students, if seeing the future was common and easy for even a small fraction of people, we wouldn&#8217;t have businesses, such as casinos, making money on gambling. But the existence of such businesses doesn&#8217;t rule out weak effects.</p>
<p>2. <em>Lack of exact repetition</em>. An obvious criticism is that Bem slanted the data analysis to favor the results he wanted. In any data analysis of unfamiliar data, you must choose &#8212; how to transform the data, what test to use, and so on. You must also choose how many subjects to run and how many trials to give them. There are rules for these choices (Bem doesn&#8217;t seem to know how to choose a transformation) but nevertheless they allow favoritism to creep in. Drug trials have big problems along these lines &#8212; severe slanting of the analysis to make the results more favorable &#8212; which is why when you register a clinical trial you must specify the endpoints. The answer to the criticism that your data-analysis choices made your favored result more likely is to do a data analysis with no choices at all. This cannot be done from scratch. You need to do the experiment once, make all the necessary choices, and then do the same experiment again (same everything as much as possible) and analyze the data exactly the way you analyzed the data from the first experiment. Bem never does this. Instead each experiment is different from all the rest. This is what experimental psychologists traditionally do but here it is a bad idea. Better to have taken the two simplest and clearest effects (priming and word learning) and repeated them several times exactly.</p>
<p>3. <em>Were experiments left out? </em>Let&#8217;s say you observe a weakly-significant result, p = 0.03. Now you do the same experiment eight more times. How likely is it that each of the eight replications will also find a significant difference? Quite low. Yet Bem finds a weakly significant difference in each of his nine experiments. This is highly unlikely. Bem appears unaware of the problem. Mendel had the same problem (data too good to be true). Ultimately Mendel was proved right. But again it stresses that Bem should do exact repetitions and report the results no matter what if he wants to be more persuasive.</p>

				<small>Friday, November 26th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>&#8230; is the title of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/magazine/21Epilepsy-t.html">a <em>New York Times Magazine </em>article</a> about the ketogenic diet, a treatment for childhood epilepsy, which I&#8217;ve blogged about several times (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/10/the-ketogenic-diet/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/15/the-ketogenic-diet-and-evidence-snobs/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/30/the-ketogenic-diet-continued/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/01/24/animal-fat-sleep-and-the-ketogenic-diet/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/06/12/goes-against-everything-i-was-taught-in-med-school/">here</a>). It&#8217;s a very-high-fat diet. It interests me for two reasons: (a) It connects a high-fat diet with proper brain function, as my self-experiments have done. A curious feature of the ketogenic diet is that it isn&#8217;t permanent. After several years the child can go off it. My self-experimentation suggests that Americans eat far too little of certain fats. Perhaps eating enough of these fats would prevent childhood epilepsy. (b) It shows how someone who cares enough &#8212; in this case, Jim Abrahams, whose son had epilepsy &#8212; can be more effective than professional researchers and doctors. Abrahams rediscovered the diet. He saw its value, the professionals didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve argued that this is part of why my self-experimentation found new solutions to common problems: because I had those problems. I cared more about finding a workable solution than researchers in those areas, who had several other concerns (publication, funding, acceptance, etc.).</p>
<p>The details of the article reminded me of something I learned in the BBC series <em>The Story of Science</em>. For hundreds of years, medical students were told, following Aristotle, that the liver has three lobes. It doesn&#8217;t. You might think that examination of thousands of actual livers would have dispelled the wrong idea, but it didn&#8217;t. The article contains many examples of doctors ignoring perfectly good evidence in favor of nonsense they read in a book or heard in a lecture. Epilepsy is easy to measure. If a child has 100 seizures per day, and has been having them at this rate for years, and this goes down to 5 shortly after he starts the ketogenic diet, and goes up again when the child goes off the diet, there is no doubt the diet works. As early as the 1930s, this had been observed hundreds of times. This was overwhelming evidence of effectiveness. Doctors ignored it, probably based on the modern equivalent of the three-lobed liver. They complained, according to the article, that there was &#8220;no evidence it worked&#8221; or that the evidence wasn&#8217;t &#8220;controlled&#8221; or &#8220;scientific&#8221; (whatever that means). A study published in 2008 &#8220;answered doubts about keto&#8217;s clinical effectiveness&#8221; &#8212; as if doctors needed the equivalent of a very-large-type book to be able to read what most of us can read with normal-sized type.</p>
<p>According to the article, &#8220;by 2000, more people were asking about keto, but most pediatric neurologists still would not prescribe it&#8221; &#8212; as if the parents needed the approval of their doctor to try it. You don&#8217;t need a prescription to buy food.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, November 10th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A few weeks ago, a female biology professor from Berkeley gave a talk at Tsinghua as part of a women-in-science series. During the question period, a student asked how to choose a research topic. <em>You have a choice of labs; which should you choose? You have a choice of research questions; which should you choose?</em> An excellent question: Every young scientist wonders about this.</p>
<p>The speaker&#8217;s answer: <em>Believe in yourself</em>. Huh? This came from her personal history. When she was a grad student (at Berkeley) she proposed a certain line of research to her advisor. Her advisor said it was a bad idea. She switched to Harvard and pursued her idea there. It paid off. A sign of her success is that her lab gets $1 million/year in grants.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t there. The friend who told me the professor&#8217;s unhelpful answer asked how I would answer the same question. During graduate school, I thought a lot about it &#8212; about how to do research that anyone will care about in fifty years. I can answer it only for experimental psychology.</p>
<p>Firstï¼Œ<em>invent a new method or study a large puzzling experimental effect. </em>With either one you can generate a steady steam of publications. Inventing a new method mean inventing a better way &#8212; usually, a faster way &#8212; of measuring something important. You can then apply your new method all over the place. With a large experimental effect you can vary all sorts of things and narrow in on an explanation. As a grad student, I took the first route: I used a new way of studying animal time discrimination. I didn&#8217;t invent it but its inventor hadn&#8217;t seen its value. An example of the second route is the career of John Garcia. In graduate school, he discovered that making rats sick after eating a new flavor caused them to dislike the flavor. The sickness could come hours after the flavor. Garcia made a whole career out of doing variations on this.</p>
<p>Second, <em>take advantage of whatever is unusual about you.</em> If you are unusually interested in X, study X. I differed in two ways from most experimental psychologists: I was better at math, and I cared more about writing. Taking advantage of this, I spent a lot of time on data analysis and writing. Both paid off. I suppose my paper were better written than necessary but the time spent onÂ  writing paid off because I got good ideas while writing.</p>
<p>Third, <em>collect a rich data set</em>. New experimental effects are enormously important &#8212; if you manage to find one you can spend the rest of your career studying it &#8212; but are also very difficult to find.Â  You can&#8217;t do experiments whose main purpose is to look for them. The chances of success are too low. To find them, you set up your research so that a conventional experiment has the possibility of finding them. For that you need a rich data set &#8212; a data set with many factors and many levels of each factor, ideally. The new way of studying timing that I used provided a rich data set. Quite soon this led to discovering a new effect when some of the data changed in a surprising way.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, November 2nd, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Via <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/10/supplements-kill.html">Robin Hanson</a> I found <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/297/8/842">this study of the effects of antioxidant supplements</a>. It studied five (e.g., Vitamins A and C). Overall they were slightly harmful, except selenium.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t intuitive &#8212; why should they differ? &#8212; but fits well with previous work:</p>
<p>1. Evidence for benefits of selenium is overwhelming. You can look at a county-by-county map of US cancer rates and see a sharp drop along a certain line in the northeast. The line separates different geology. There is much more selenium in the soil on the low-cancer side of the line. Yet another case where correlation is powerful evidence for causation. An experiment with selenium supplementation found a reduction in cancer.</p>
<p>2. Several years ago, <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/summary/2004/final-caret1204">two experiments found Vitamin A supplements increased lung cancer</a>. (<a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199404143301501">Another study</a>.) <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/7706860/Too-many-vitamin-tablets-could-be-bad-for-your-health.html">Later experiments cast doubt on Vitamins C and E</a>. As one of Robin&#8217;s readers put it: &#8220;two of which were previously well known to be bad for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given this previous research, which is far more persuasive than the current study, the interesting contribution of the new study is methodological: will a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies reach the right conclusions? Will the signal outweigh the many sources of bias and error? In fact, it did. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/10/27/periodontitis-and-omega-3/">Again suggesting</a> that severe critics of epidemiology, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/10/13/the-contribution-of-john-ioannidis/">such as John Ioannidis</a>, go too far.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.annals.org/content/153/8/532.full.pdf+html">A new study</a> in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> asked how often placebo-controlled medical studies made clear what the placebo was. <a href="http://www.annals.org/content/153/8/532.abstract">The abstract</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most studies did not disclose the composition of the study placebo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which may give the wrong impression. About 90% of the studies they looked at did not say what the placebo was.</p>
<p>The paper illustrates the problem with an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>In one of these studies [where the placebo was not described], the authors commented that â€œThe lack of any overall effect in patients with myocardial infarction might be related to the unexpectedly low mortality rate in the placebo group.â€ The possibility that the placebo composition may have influenced this â€œunexpectedly low mortalityâ€ was apparently not considered.</p>

				<small>Thursday, October 28th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I learned of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159403382X/ref=">The Human Factor: Inside the CIAâ€™s Dysfunctional Intelligence Culture</a> by <a href="http://www.ishmaeljones.com/">Ishmael Jones</a> (a pseudonym) from <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2010/10/interview-with-an-ex-spy-ishmael-jones-on-his-book-the-cia-and-the-lawsuit.html">an interview on the <em>New Yorker </em>website</a>. This comment by the author interested me:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none">Once  the C.I.A. became a place to get rich, effective operations ended.  Today, more than ninety per cent of C.I.A. employees live and work  entirely within the United States, in violation of the C.I.A.â€™s founding  charter [to supply only foreign intelligence].</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I could say much the same about science: Once it became a place to get rich (or at least get large grants), effective science became a lot less common. A great deal of science is done by drug companies. They pay a lot. Some of their scientists are surely brilliant but their talents are wasted by the need to find solutions that will be highly profitable. My self-experimentation found solutions that cost nothing and make far more intellectual sense. I was able to do something that didn&#8217;t produce a lot of publications because it <strong>wasn&#8217;t</strong> my job.</p>
<p>Many skills make good full-time jobs. Science doesn&#8217;t. There is too much pressure for short-term results. Without short-term results, you may lose your job or your grant. (Or, in China, most of your income.) Nor is science a good source of status. If you want your science to provide your status, you will be under great pressure to conform. Yet for practically all scientists, it&#8217;s their full-time job <strong>and </strong>their main source of status. This may not make it impossible for them to do good work but I suspect it comes close to doing so. My self-experimentation was effective not only because it was fast and cheap (per experiment) but also because I could be slow (per publication) and do something low-status.</p>
