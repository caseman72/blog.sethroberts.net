				<small>Friday, January 13th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Peter A. Lawrence is a British biologist who has written <a href="http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/PAL/NewFiles/PAListFrames.html">several papers</a> about problems with the way biology and other areas of science are now done. In<a href="http://www.lab-times.org/labtimes/issues/lt2011/lt02/lt_2011_02_24_31.pdf"> this interview</a> a year ago he summarizes his complaints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientific publication &#8220;has become a system of collecting counters for particular purposes – to get grants, to get tenure, etc. – rather than to communicate and illuminate findings to other people. The literature is, by and large, unreadable.&#8221; There is far too much counting of papers.</li>
<li>&#8220;There’s a reward system for building up a large group, if you can, and it doesn’t really matter how many of your group fail, as long as one or two succeed. You can build your career on their success.&#8221; If you do something on your own it is viewed with suspicion.</li>
<li>There is too much emphasis on counting citations. &#8220;If you work in a big crowded field, you’ll get many more citations. . . . This is independent of the quality of the work or whether you’ve contributed anything. [There is] enormous pressure on the journals to accept papers that will be cited a lot. And this is also having a corrupting effect. Journals will tend to take papers in medically-related disciplines, for example, that mention or relate to common genetic diseases. Journals from, say, the Cell group, will favor such papers when they’re submitted.&#8221;</li>
<li>Grant writing takes too much time &#8212; e.g., 30-40% of your time. &#8220;There is an enormous increase in bureaucracy – form<br />
filling, targeting, assessment, evaluations. This has gone right through society, like the Black Death!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Science is not like some kind of an army, with a large number of people who make the main steps forward together. You need to have individually creative people who are making breakthroughs – who make things different. But how do you find those people? I don’t think you want to have a situation in which only those who are competitive and tough can<br />
get to the top, and those who are reflective and retiring would be cast aside.&#8221; I&#8217;ve said something similar: Science is like single ants wandering around looking for food, not like a trail of ants to and from a food source. The trail of ants is engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree. I would add that I think modern biology is far too invested in the idea that genes cause disease and that studying genes will help reduce human suffering. I think the historical record (the last 30 years) shows that this is not a promising line of work &#8212; but modern biologists cannot switch course.</p>
<p>What explains the depressing facts Lawrence points out? I think it is something deep and impossible to change: <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf"><strong>Science and job don&#8217;t mix well</strong></a>. The demands of any job and the demands of science are not very compatible. Jobs are about repetition. Science is the opposite. Jobs demand regular output. Science is unpredictable. However, jobs and science  overlap in terms of training: Both benefit from specialized knowledge. They also overlap in terms of resources: More resources (e.g., better tools) will usually help you do your job better, likewise with science. So we have two groups (insiders &#8212; professional scientists &#8212; and outsiders &#8212; everyone else). Both groups have big advantages and big disadvantages relative to the other. In the last 50 years, the insiders have been &#8220;winning&#8221; in the sense of doing better work. Their advantages of training and resources far outweighed the problems caused by the need for repetition and predictability. But now &#8212; as I try to show on this blog &#8212; outsiders are catching up and going ahead because the necessary training and tools have become much more widely available (e.g., tools have become much cheaper). And, as Lawrence emphasizes, professional science has gotten worse.</p>

				<small>Thursday, January 5th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Epidemiology has lots of critics.<em></em> In <a href="http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/epidemi-reviews.htm">this article</a>, for example, it is called &#8220;lying on a grand scale.&#8221; Every critique I have read has ignored history. Epidemiologists have been right about two major issues: 1. Heavy smoking causes lung cancer. 2. Folate deficiency causes birth defects. In both cases, the first evidence was epidemiological. Another example is John Snow&#8217;s conclusion about the value of clean water. In my experience, epidemiologists often overstate the strength of their evidence (as do most of us) but overstatement is quite different from having nothing worth saying.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example. Many people think osteoporosis is due to lack of calcium. Bones are made of calcium, right? The epidemiology of hip fractures is clear. In spite of the conventional idea, the rate of hip fracture has been <strong>highest</strong> in places where people eat a lot of calcium, such as Sweden, and <strong>lowest</strong> in places where they eat little, such as Hong Kong. (<a href="http://mydrmo.com/2011/10/got-milk-the-truth-about-osteoporosis-calcium-dairy-products/">For example</a>.) In other words, the epidemiology flatly contradicted the conventional idea. This was apparently ignored by nutrition experts (<em>everyone knows correlation does not equal causation</em>) who advised millions of people, especially women, to take calcium supplements  to avoid osteoporosis. Millions of people followed (and follow) that advice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21505219">Thanks to a recent meta-analysis<em></em></a> we now know that experiments and better data firmly support the earlier epidemiology, which suggested that calcium supplements are dangerous. Here are its main conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p>In meta-analyses of placebo controlled trials of calcium or calcium and vitamin D, complete trial-level data were available for 28,072 participants from eight trials of calcium supplements and the WHI CaD participants not taking personal calcium supplements. . . .Calcium or calcium and vitamin D increased the risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.24 (1.07 to 1.45), P = 0.004) and the composite of myocardial infarction or stroke (1.15 (1.03 to 1.27), P = 0.009). . . . A reassessment of the role of calcium supplements in osteoporosis management is warranted.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the epidemiology had been taken more seriously, many heart attacks might have been avoided.</p>
<p>Is this an &#8220;anecdote&#8221; &#8212; a single example &#8212; proving nothing? Here&#8217;s how you can check. Randomly select a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies. Thousands have been done. Then ask if the results summarized in the meta-analysis appear random. Better yet, randomly pick two meta-analyses. Suppose the first summarizes 5 studies and the second summarizes 6. If the 11 results were shuffled together, how well could you assign them correctly?</p>

					<p>At the Quantified Self blog, in response to <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/10/seth-roberts-on-qs-paleo">a video of me talking about QS and the Ancestral Health Symposium</a> (paleo), someone named Colin made <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/10/seth-roberts-on-qs-paleo/#comment-3984">the following comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Very interesting talk. I am just curious how someone can claim a study conducted with a sample size of one is “100 times better” than someone else’s study. I do not know anything about the other study mentioned, but I do know that a study based on n=1 cannot be considered scientific proof. And sure, he hears from people who have lost weight drinking the sugar water he prescribed, but it is quite possible there are 100 times as many people who didn’t email him because they didn’t see any positive results and decided to try something else. I think the QS stuff is very interesting and helpful on a personal level, but it seems like a stretch to generalize your results to others.</p></blockquote>
<p>I responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have two responses.</p>
<p>1. Sample size isn’t everything. Sure, a study with n=1 isn’t “scientific proof”. Nor is any other study, in my experience. “Scientific proof” has always required many studies. New scientific ideas have very often started with n = 1 experiments or observations. Later, larger experiments or observations were done. Both — the initial n=1 observation and the later n = many observations — were necessary for the new idea to be discovered and confirmed.</p>
<p>2. The history of biology teaches there are few exceptions to general rules. See any biology textbook. For example, a textbook might say “lymphocytes fight germs”. This means no serious exceptions have ever been found to that rule. So, as matter of biological history, the person who managed to figure out what one particular lymphocyte does turned out to have figured out what they all do. Biology textbooks have thousands of statements like “lymphocytes fight infection” meaning that this sequence of events (you can generalize from one to all, or nearly all) has happened thousands of times. There is no shadow hidden history of biology that teaches otherwise.</p></blockquote>

				<small>Thursday, December 15th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In the latest issue of <em>American Scientist</em>, Andrew Gelman (an old friend) and Kaiser Fung <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/freakonomics-what-went-wrong/1">criticize <em>Freakonomics</em> and <em>Superfreakonomics</em> by Steve Levitt and Stephen Dubner</a> (who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/11FREAK.html?pagewanted=all">wrote about my work</a>). Although the article is titled &#8220;Freakonomics: What Went Wrong?&#8221; none of the supposed errors are in <em>Freakonomics</em>. You can get an idea of the conclusions from the title and this sentence: &#8220;How could an experienced journalist and a widely respected researcher slip up in so many ways?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gelman and Fung examine a series (&#8220;so many ways&#8221;) of what they consider mistakes. I will comment on each of them.</p>
<p>1. <strong>The case of the missing girls</strong>. I agree with Gelman and Fung: Levitt and Dubner accepted Emily Oster&#8217;s research too uncritically.</p>
<p>2. <strong>The risk of driving a car</strong>. I think Gelman and Fung miss the point. Yes, the claim (driving drunk is safer than walking drunk) was not well-supported by the evidence provided because the comparison was so confounded. However, I read the whole example differently. I didn&#8217;t think that Levitt and Dubner thought drunk people should drive. I thought their point was more subtle &#8212; that comparisons are difficult (&#8220;look how we can reach a crazy conclusion&#8221;).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Stars are made not born</strong>. I think Gelman and Fung fail to see the big picture. The birth-month effect in professional sports, which Gelman and Fung dismiss as &#8220;very small,&#8221; is of great interest to many people, if not to Gelman and Fung.  It suggests what Levitt and Dubner and Gladwell and others say: Early success matters. That&#8217;s not obvious at all. There are lots of similar associations in epidemiology. They have been the first evidence for many important conclusions, such as smoking causes lung cancer. Are professional sports important? Maybe. But epidemiology and epidemiological methods are surely important. By learning about this effect, we learn about them. Lots of smart people fail to take epidemiology seriously enough (e.g., &#8220;correlation does not equal causation&#8221;).</p>
<p>4. <strong>Making the majors and hitting a curve ball</strong>. Gelman and Fung point out that one sentence is misleading. One sentence. This is called <em>praising with faint damn</em>.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Predicting terrorists</strong>. Gelman and Fung say that the terrorist prediction algorithm of a man named Ian Horsley, which Levitt and Dubner seem to take seriously, is not practical. But their review fails to convince me it was presented as practical. Since there are no data about how well the algorithm works, and Levitt and Dubner are all about data&#8230;.</p>
<p>6. <strong>The climate change dust-up</strong>. I agree with Gelman and Fung that Nathan Myrvold&#8217;s geoengineering ideas are unimportant. (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/25/billionaire-genius-and-this/">My view of Myrvold&#8217;s patent trolling</a>.)  But in this case, I&#8217;d say both sides &#8212; Gelman and Fung <strong>and</strong> Levitt and Dubner &#8212; miss what&#8217;s really important, namely that the usual claims that humans are dangerously warming the planet are held far too strongly. The advocates of this view are far too sure of themselves. I have blogged about this <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/global-warming/">many times</a>. In a nutshell, the climate models that we are supposed to trust have never been shown to persuasively predict the climate ten or twenty years from now (or even one year from now). There is no good reason to believe them. That Levitt and Dubner seem to take that stuff seriously is the only big criticism I have of their work . At least in that geoengineering stuff Levitt and Dubner were dissenting from conventional wisdom. Gelman and Fung do not. They fail to realize that something we&#8217;ve been told thousands of times is nonsense (in the sense of being wildly overstated). It was Levitt and Dubner&#8217;s comments about this that led me to look closely at all that climate-change scare stuff. I was surprised how poor the evidence was.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with Gelman and Fung&#8217;s critique is that they say nothing about the great contribution of Steve Levitt to economics. They fail to grasp that he has made economics considerably more of a science, if by <em>science</em> you mean a data-driven enterprise as opposed to an ideologically-driven or prestige-driven one (mathematics is prestigious, the more difficult, the more prestigious). He did so by pioneering a new way to use data to learn interesting things. His method is essentially epidemiological, except his methods are considerably better (better matching, less formulaic) and his topics much more diverse (e.g., sumo wrestling) than mainstream epidemiology. A large fraction of prestige economics is math, divorced from empirical tests. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/13/nobel-prize-report-card/">This stuff wins Nobel Prizes</a>, but, in my and many other people&#8217;s opinion, contributes very little to understanding. (<a href="escholarship.org/uc/item/5vt0z72k">Psychology has had the same <em>too much math, too little data</em> problem</a> &#8212; minus the Nobel Prizes, of course.) To persuade a big chunk of an entire discipline to pay more attention to data is a huge accomplishment.</p>
<p>Levitt&#8217;s methodological innovation makes <em>Freakonomics</em> far from what Gelman and Fung call &#8220;pop statistics&#8221;. It is actually an amusing and well-written record of something close to a revolution. In the 1980s, a friend of mine at UC Berkeley took an introductory economics class. She told me a little of what the teacher said in class. All theory. <em>What about data?</em> I said. <em>It&#8217;s a strange science that doesn&#8217;t care about data.</em> My friend went to office hours. She asked the instructor (a Berkeley economics professor): What about data? <em>Don&#8217;t worry about data</em>, he replied. Gelman and Fung fail to appreciate what economics used to be like. The ratio of strongly-asserted ideas to persuasive data used to be very large. Now it is less.</p>

					<p>In <a href="http://bacteriality.com/2008/04/13/wolcott/">this interview</a>, a doctor who does research on biofilms named Randall Wolcott makes the same point <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/06/testing-treatments-eight-questions-for-the-authors/">I made about <em>Testing Treatments</em></a> &#8212; that evidence-based medicine, as now practiced, suppresses innovation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I take it you [meaning the interviewer] are familiar with evidence-based medicine? It’s the increasingly accepted approach for making clinical decisions about how to treat a patient. Basically, doctors are trained to make a decision based on the most current evidence derived from research. But what such thinking boils down to [in practice -- theory is different] is that I am supposed to do the same thing that has always been done – to treat my patient in the conventional manner – just because it’s become the most popular approach. However, when it comes to chronic wound biofilms, we are in the midst of a crisis – what has been done and is accepted as the standard treatment doesn’t work and doesn’t meet the needs of the patient.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thus, evidence-based medicine totally regulates against innovation. Essentially doctors suffer if they step away from mainstream thinking. Sure, there are charlatans out there who are trying to sell us treatments that don’t work, but there are many good therapies that are not used because they are unconventional. It is only by considering new treatment options that we can progress.</p>
<p>Right on. He goes on to say that he is unwilling to do a double-blind clinical trial in which some patients do not receive his new therapy because &#8220;we know we’ve got the methods to save most of their limbs&#8221; from amputation.</p>
<p>Almost all scientific and intellectual history (and much serious journalism) is about how things begin. How ideas began and spread, how inventions are invented. If you write about Steve Jobs, for example, that&#8217;s your real subject. How things <strong>fail</strong> to begin &#8212; how good ideas are killed off &#8212; is at least as important, but much harder to write about. This is why <a href="www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Tyler Cowen&#8217;s <em>The Great Stagnation</em></a> is such an important book. It says nothing about the killing-off processes, but at least it describes the stagnation they have caused. Stagnation should scare us. As Jane Jacobs often said, if it lasts long enough, it causes collapse.</p>

					<p>From <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/03/vitamin-d-sunlight-and-sleep-more/#comment-930611">this comment</a> (thanks, <a href="http://www.elizabethmolin.com/">Elizabeth Molin</a>) I learned of a British book called <em>Testing Treatments</em> (<a href="http://www.testingtreatments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TT-interactive-optimised.pdf">pdf</a>), whose second edition has just come out. Its goal is to make readers more sophisticated consumers of medical research. To help them distinguish &#8220;good&#8221; science from &#8220;bad&#8221; science. Ben Goldacre, the Bad Science columnist, <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2011/10/new-edition-of-testing-treatments-best-lay-text-on-evidence-based-medicine/">fulsomely praises it</a> (&#8220;I genuinely, truly, cannot recommend this awesome book highly enough for its clarity, depth, and humanity&#8221;). He wrote a foreword. The main text is by Imogen Evans (medical journalist), Hazel Thornton (writer),  Iain Chalmers (medical researcher), and Paul Glaziou (medical researcher, editor of <em>Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine</em>).</p>
<p>To me, as I&#8217;ve said, medical research is almost entirely bad. Almost all medical researchers accept two remarkable rules: (a) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/09/18/first-let-them-get-sick/"><strong>first, let them get sick</strong></a> and (b) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/29/no-cheap-remedies/"><strong>no cheap remedies</strong></a>. These rules severely limit what is studied. In terms of useful progress, the price of these limits has been enormous: near total enfeeblement. For many years the Nobel Prize in Medicine has documented the continuing failure of medical researchers all over the world to make significant progress on all major health problems, including depression, heart disease, obesity, cancer, diabetes, stroke, and so on. It is consistent with their level of understanding that some people associated with medicine would write a book about how to do something (good science) the whole field manifestly can&#8217;t do. <em>Testing Treatments</em> isn&#8217;t just a fat person writing a book about how to lose weight, it&#8217;s the author failing to notice he&#8217;s fat. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/06/testing-treatments-eight-questions-for-the-authors/#more-4458" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For the last four years or so I have daily measured how well my brain is working by means of balance measurements and mental tests. For three years  I have used a test of simple arithmetic (e.g, 7 * 8, 2 + 5). I try to answer as fast as possible. I take faster answers to indicate a better-functioning brain.</p>
<p>Yesterday my score was much better than usual. This shows what happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-10-30-arithmetic-outlier-day2.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4402" title="2011-10-30 arithmetic outlier day" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-10-30-arithmetic-outlier-day2-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>My usual average is about 550 msec or more; my score yesterday was 525 msec. An unexplained improvement of 25 msec. </p>
<p>What caused the improvement? I came up with a list of ways that yesterday was much different than usual, that is, was an outlier in other ways. These are possible causes. From more to less plausible:</p>
<p>1. I had 33 g extra flaxseed last night. (By mistake. I&#8217;m not sure about this.)</p>
<p>2. The test came at the perfect time after I had my afternoon yogurt with 33 g flaxseed. When I took flaxseed oil (now I eat ground flaxseed), it was clear that there was a short-term improvement for a few hours.</p>
<p>3. Many afternoons I eat 33 g ground flaxseed with yogurt. Yesterday I ground the afternoon flaxseed an unusually long time, making made the omega-3 more digestible.</p>
<p>4. I did kettlebells swings and a kettlebell walk about 2 hours before the test. These exercises are not new but usually I do them on different days. Yesterday was the first time I&#8217;ve done them on the same day. I&#8217;m sure ordinary walking improves performance for perhaps 30 minutes after I stop walking.</p>
<p>5. I had duck and miso soup a half-hour before the test. Almost never eat this.</p>
<p>6. I had a fermented egg (&#8220;thousand-year-old egg&#8221;) at noon. I rarely eat them.</p>
<p>7. I had peanuts with my yogurt and ground flaxseed. Peanuts alone seem to have no effect. Perhaps something in the peanuts improves digestion of the omega-3 in the flaxseed.</p>
<p>8. I started watching faces at 7 am that morning instead of 6:30 am or earlier.</p>
<p>Here are eight ideas to test. Perhaps one or two will turn out to be important. Perhaps none will.</p>
<p>After I made this list, I read student papers. The assignment was to comment on a research article. One of the articles was about the effect of holding a warm versus cold coffee cup. Holding a warm coffee cup makes you act &#8220;warmer,&#8221; said the article. Commenting on this, a student said she thought it was ridiculous until she remembered going to the barber. She sees the person who washes her hair (in warm water) as friendly, the barber as cold. Maybe this is due to the warm water used to wash her hair, she noted. This made me realize another unusual feature of yesterday: I had washed my hair in warm water longer than usual. I think I did it at least 30 minutes before the arithmetic test but I&#8217;m not sure. In any case, here is another idea to test. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/05/does-shower-temperature-affect-brain-speed/">I found earlier that cold showers slowed down my arithmetic speed</a>. </p>
<p>This illustrates a big advantage of personal science (science done for personal gain) over professional science (science done because it&#8217;s your job): The random variation in my life may suggest plausible new ideas. As far as I can tell, professional scientists have learned almost nothing about practical ways to make your brain work better. You can find many lists of &#8220;brain food&#8221; on the internet. Inevitably the evidence is weak. I&#8217;d be surprised if any of them helped more than a tiny amount (in my test, a few msec). The real brain foods, in my experience, are butter and omega-3. Perhaps my tests will merely confirm the value of omega-3 (Explanations 1-3). But perhaps not (Explanations 4-8 and head heating).</p>

					<p>The Nobel Prizes awarded each year resemble a kind of report card where each prize-worthy discipline (Physics, Chemistry, etc.) gets a grade that depends on the prize-winning research. If the prize-winning research is useful and surprising, the grade is high. If not the grade is low. More generally, at least to me, the intellectual history of the prize winners sheds light on the whole profession. Perhaps some biologists were unaware of the behavior of Eric Kandel described in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Explorers-Black-Box-Search-Cellular/dp/0595189628"><em>Explorers of the Black Box</em></a> when he was awarded the biology prize. Kandel, I hasten to add, is an unusual case.</p>
<p>Thomas Sargent is one of the winners of this year&#8217;s Economics prize. In 2007, he gave <a href="https://files.nyu.edu/ts43/public/personal/UC_graduation.pdf">a graduation speech</a> at Berkeley to economics majors (via <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/10/assorted-links-247.html">Marginal Revolution</a>). In the speech, Sargent called economics &#8220;organized common sense&#8221;. He went on to list 12 common-sense ideas, such as &#8220;Individuals and communities face trade-offs&#8221; and &#8220;governments and voters respond to incentives&#8221; that economists believe. The reasons for their belief weren&#8217;t stated.</p>
<p>When I started as a professor (at Berkeley) I did many experiments with rats and, to my annoyance, discovered an inconvenient truth: I understood rats less well than I thought. Even in a heavily-controlled heavily-studied situation (Skinner box), my rats often did not do what I expected. My common sense was often wrong, in other words. This experience made me considerably more skeptical of other people&#8217;s &#8220;common sense&#8221;.</p>
<p>To me, and I think to most scientists, science <strong>begins</strong> with common sense. Experimental psychology certainly does. I used common sense to design my experiments. Had I not done those experiments, I would not have learned that my common sense was wrong. So relying on common sense was helpful &#8212; as a place to start. As a way to begin to understand. You begin with common-sense ideas and you test them. That common sense is often wrong is a theme of <em>Freakonomics</em>, in agreement with my experience. Yet Sargent seemed content (he called economics &#8220;our beautiful subject&#8221;) to <strong>end</strong> with common sense, perhaps tidied up.</p>
<p>This is really unfortunate because economics, beautiful or not, is so important. <strong>If you ignore data, the answer to every hard question is the same: the most powerful people are right</strong>. That way lies stagnation (problems build up unsolved because powerful people prefer the status quo) and collapse (when the problems become overwhelming). Alan Greenspan&#8217;s faith-based belief in free markets and the 2008 financial crisis &#8212; after Sargent&#8217;s speech &#8212; is an example. In 2009, Sargent&#8217;s speech might have been less well-received.</p>

					<p>Recently the <em>Guardian</em> ran <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/sep/05/publish-perish-peer-review-science">an article by David Colquhoun</a>, a professor of pharmacology at University College London, complaining about peer review. His complaints were innocuous; what was interesting was his example. <em>How bad is peer review? </em>he said<em>. Look what gets published!</em> He pointed to <a href="http://www.dcscience.net/paterson-acu-BJGP-2011.pdf">a study of the efficacy of acupuncture</a> and included graphs of the results. &#8220;It&#8217;s obvious at a glance that acupuncture has at best a tiny and erratic effect on any of the outcomes that were measured,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Except it wasn&#8217;t. There were four graphs. Each had two lines &#8212; one labelled &#8220;acupuncture,&#8221; the other labelled &#8220;control&#8221;. You might think to assess the effect of acupuncture you compare the two lines. That wasn&#8217;t true. The labels were misleading. The &#8220;acupuncture&#8221; group got acupuncture early in the experiment; the &#8220;control&#8221; group got acupuncture late in the experiment. Better names would have been <em>early treatment</em> and <em>late treatment</em>. You could not allow for this &#8220;at a glance&#8221;. It was too complicated. With this design, if acupuncture were effective the difference between the two lines <strong>should</strong> be &#8220;erratic&#8221;.</p>
<p>The paper&#8217;s data analysis is poor. To judge the efficacy of acupuncture, their main comparison used only the data from the first 26 weeks. They could have used data from all 52 weeks. That is, they ignored half of their data when trying to answer their main question. Colquhoun could have criticized that, but he didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Colquhoun&#8217;s criticism was so harsh and shallow, apparently he is biased against acupuncture. But there are two big things few pharmacology professors appear to know. One is how to stimulate the immune system. This should be central in pharmacology, but it isn&#8217;t. Half of why I think fermented foods are so important is that I think they stimulate the immune system. (The other half is they improve digestion.) There are plenty of less common ways to do this. The phenomenon of hormesis suggests that small doses of all sorts of poisons, including radiation, stimulate repair systems. The evidence behind the hygiene hypothesis suggests that dirt improves the immune systems of children. Bee stings have been used to treat arthritis. And so on. In this context, sticking needles into someone, which puts a small amount of bacteria into their blood, is not absurd. Acupuncture also allowed patients to share their symptoms, the value of which <a href="http://www.moodscope.com/">Jon Cousins has emphasized</a>.</p>
<p>The other big thing Colquhoun doesn&#8217;t seem to know is the absurdity of the chemical imbalance theory of depression. Speaking of ridiculous, <strong>that&#8217;s</strong> ridiculous. Which plays a larger role in modern medicine &#8212; antidepressants or acupuncture? If you want criticize peer review, criticize the chemical imbalance theory. It is as if peer reviewers have been saying, <em>yes, the earth really is flat</em> for fifty years. Perhaps this is ending. During a talk that Robert Whitaker gave at the Massachusetts General Hospital in January, he was <a href="http://madinamerica.com/madinamerica.com/Answering%20critics.html">told by doctors there</a> that the chemical-imbalance theory was an &#8220;outdated model&#8221;.</p>

					<p>With the ability to measure individual genes has come interest in learning what they do. Perhaps Person X is depressed and Person Y is not depressed because Person X&#8217;s genes differ from Person Y&#8217;s. A whole generation of psychiatry researchers now believes this is plausible.

					<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/08/29/alexandra-carmichael-almost-eliminates-headaches/">Yesterday I wrote</a> how <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/08/my-n1-quest-to-live-headache-free/">Alexandra Carmichael&#8217;s headache story</a> illustrated a large and awful truth about modern healthcare: It happily provides expensive relief of symptoms while ignoring investigation of underlying causes. If we understood underlying causes (e.g., causes of migraines), prevention would be easy. <em>Let people get sick so that we can make money from them.</em> There should be a name for this scam. In law enforcement, it&#8217;s called entrapment.</p>
<p>Sensible prevention research would start small. Not by trying to prevent breast cancer, or heart disease, or something like that: They take many years to develop and therefore are hard to study. Sensible prevention research would focus on things that are easy to measure and happen soon after their causative agents. One example is migraines. Migraines happen hours after exposure. The fact that Chemical X causes migraines means it is likely that Chemical X is bad for us, even if it doesn&#8217;t cause migraines in everyone. This is the canary-in-a-coal-mine idea. Migraines are the canary.</p>
<p>Acne is another canary. Acne is easy to measure. Figuring out how to prevent it would be a good way to begin prevention research. To prevent acne would be to take the first steps toward preventing many more diseases. A <strong>high-school student</strong> could do ground-breaking research &#8212; research that would improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people &#8212; about how to prevent acne but somehow this never happens. In spite of this possibility, grand-prize-winning high-school science projects, from the most brilliant students in the whole country, are always about trivia.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960321-8/abstract">A just-published review</a> in <em>The Lancet</em> reveals once again the unfortunate perspective of medical school professors. The abstract ends with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>New research is needed into the therapeutic comparative effectiveness and safety of the many products available, and to better understand the natural history, subtypes, and triggers of acne.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, finding out what causes acne is all that&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>To figure out what causes acne (and thereby how to prevent it) three things are necessary: (a) study of environmental causes, such as diet, (b) starting with n=1, and (c) willingness to test many ideas that might be wrong (because it&#8217;s far from obvious how to prevent acne). All three of these things are exactly what the current healthcare research system opposes. It opposes prevention research because drug companies don&#8217;t fund it. It opposes n=1 studies because they are small and cheap, which is low-status. To do such a study would be like driving a Corolla. It opposes studies that could take indefinitely long because such studies are bad for a researcher&#8217;s career. Researchers need a steady stream of publications.</p>
<p>High school students, who aren&#8217;t worried about status or number of publications, could make a real contribution here. You don&#8217;t need fancy equipment to measure acne.</p>

					<p>Last night I slept unusually well, waking up more rested and with more energy than usual.  I slept longer than usual: 7.0 hours versus my usual 5.1 hours (median of the previous 20 days).  My rating of how rested I felt was 99.2% (that is, 99.2% of fully rested); the median of the previous 20 days is 98.8%. Because the maximum is 100%, this is really a comparison of 0.8% (this morning) with 1.2% (previous mornings); and the comparison is not adjusted for the number of times I stood on one leg to exhaustion, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">which improves this rating</a>. During the previous 20 days I often stood on one leg to exhaustion six times; yesterday I only did it four times. Above all, I felt more energy in the morning. This was obvious. I have just started to measure this.  At 8 am and 9 am, I rate my energy on a 0-100 scale where 50 = neither sluggish nor energetic/energized, 60 = slightly energetic/energized, 70 = somewhat energetic/energized, and 75 = energetic/energized. My ratings this morning were 73 (8 am) and 74 (9 am). The median of my 9 previous ratings is 62. The energy improvement (73/74 vs 62) is why I am curious. I would like to feel this way every morning.</p>
<p>What caused it? I had not exercised the previous day. My room was no darker than usual. My flaxseed oil intake was no different than usual. I had not <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2009/10/31/effect-of-animal-fat-on-sleep-more/">eaten more pork fat than usual</a>. However, four things had been different than usual:</p>
<p>1. <strong>2 tablespoons of butter at lunch</strong>. In addition to my usual 4 tablespoons per day.</p>
<p>2. <strong>0.5-1 tablespoons of butter at bedtime</strong>. Again, in addition the usual 4.</p>
<p>3. <strong>1 tablespoon (15 g) coconut butter at bedtime</strong>. Part of a longer study of the effect of coconut butter. Gary Taubes suggested this. I had eaten 1 T coconut butter at bedtime 13 previous days. On the first of those 13 days, I <em>had</em> felt a lot more energetic than usual in the morning. On the remaining days, however, the improvement was less clear. I started measuring how energetic I felt in the morning to study this further. Last night was Friday night. On the previous two nights (Wednesday and Thursday) I had not eaten the coconut butter. Maybe absence of coconut butter followed by resumption of coconut butter is the cause.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Fresh air and ambient noise</strong>. Following a friend&#8217;s suggestion, I opened one of my bedroom windows.</p>
<p>My first question is whether the improvement is repeatable. If so, I will start to vary these four factors.</p>

					<p>The most important thing I learned in graduate school &#8212; or ever &#8212; about research is: <em>Better to do than to think</em>. By <em>do</em> I mean collect data. It is better to do an experiment than to think about doing an experiment, in the sense that you will learn more from an hour spent doing (e.g., doing an experiment) than from an hour thinking about what to do. Because 99% of what goes on in university classrooms and homework assignments is much closer to thinking than doing, and because professors often say they teach &#8220;thinking&#8221; (&#8220;I teach my students how to think&#8221;) but never say they teach &#8220;doing&#8221;, you can see this goes against prevailing norms. I first came across this idea in <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2319737">an article by Paul Halmos</a> about teaching mathematics. Halmos put it like this: &#8220;The best way to learn is to do.&#8221; When I put it into practice, it was soon clear he was right. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/10/better-to-do-than-to-think/#more-3313" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Sunday, June 26th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>For several years I have been doing simple daily tests to measure my brain function. I got the idea when I noticed that a few capsules of flaxseed oil improved my balance. Flaxseed oil also improved other measures of brain function, such as digit span. I wasn&#8217;t surprised I could do better; what was surprising was how easy it was. It revealed a big gap in our understanding of nutrition. I do the daily tests not only to improve brain function but also to improve the rest of my body. I think the brain is like a canary in a coal mine &#8212; especially sensitive to bad environments. Learning what environment was best for the brain would suggest what environment is best for the rest of the body. When I started taking an optimal amount of flaxseed oil, my gums turned from red (inflamed) to pink (not inflamed), supporting this assumption.</p>
<p>I tried six or seven mental tests and eventually settled on a test of arithmetic (how fast I could do simple problems such as 5-3). I hoped that now and then my score would change (in either direction, faster or slower) and that these changes would point to new things that control brain function. No one had/has done such a thing. I had no idea if unexpected changes would show up or, if they did, how often. I didn&#8217;t know what the score changes would look like (their size and shape) nor, of course, what would cause them. Would all of them involve diet? Would all of them make sense in terms of what we already know? (Flaxseed oil makes sense because the brain contains lots of omega-3.)</p>
<p>The first two surprises were these: 1. My score suddenly improved a few days after switching from Chinese flaxseed oil to American flaxseed oil. This made sense: It is easy to destroy omega-3 if flaxseed oil is kept at room temperature. 2. My score suddenly improved when I switched from pig fat to butter. This was counter-intuitive: pig fat is more paleo than butter.</p>
<p>Last fall, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/22/another-mysterious-mental-improvement-2/">there was another surprise</a>: My score greatly improved since the summer. I was much faster than ever before. At first I thought the improvement was due to moving to Beijing. I had moved from Berkeley to Beijing in early September.  My Beijing life differed in a thousand ways from my Berkeley life. I had three ideas about which differences might matter. 1. Walnuts. Perhaps I ate more walnuts in Beijing. Walnuts are supposed to be good for brain function. 2. Heat. It was much hotter in Beijing than Berkeley. Maybe that improved brain function. 3. Vitamins. I took less vitamin supplements in Beijing. Maybe they harmed brain function.</p>
<p>I tested these possibilities. 1. I stopped eating walnuts. My arithmetic score did not clearly change. 2. Winter came, it got much colder. The improvement did not go away. 3. I took the same amount of vitamins I&#8217;d taken in Berkeley. My arithmetic score didn&#8217;t change. So all of these ideas were wrong.</p>
<p>Because they were wrong, I considered a fourth possibility: The improvement was due to removal of two mercury amalgam fillings on July 28, 2010. They were replaced with non-amalgam fillings. I&#8217;d had them removed for precautionary reasons. I wasn&#8217;t suffering from any signs of mercury poisoning. Hair tests had repeatedly shown mildly high amounts of mercury in my hair (75th percentile of an unspecified sample). Measurements of the mercury in my breath had come out higher than usual but it was hard to be sure the machine was working correctly.</p>
<p>I looked again at my data. It showed something I hadn&#8217;t noticed: the improvement started before I went to Beijing. It started very close to July 28. That was good evidence that the mercury explanation was correct. Now the evidence is even stronger. I&#8217;ve returned to Berkeley and thereby made my life quite similar to the situation when my scores were much higher than now. The improvement has remained.</p>
<p>The evidence for causality &#8212; removal of mercury amalgam fillings improved my arithmetic score &#8212; rests on three things: 1. Four other explanations made incorrect predictions. 2. The improvement, which lasted months, started within a few days of the removal. Long-term improvements (not due to practice) are rare &#8212; this is the only one I&#8217;ve noticed. 3. Mercury is known to harm neural function (&#8220;mad as a hatter&#8221;). As far as I&#8217;m concerned, that&#8217;s plenty.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_amalgam_controversy">A long Wikipedia article</a> describes evidence on both sides of the question of whether mercury amalgam fillings cause damage. In 2009, the American Dental Association stated in a press release &#8220;the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence supports the safety and efficacy of dental [mercury-containing] amalgam.&#8221;  As recently as 1991, <em>Consumer Reports</em> told readers &#8220;if a dentist wants to remove your fillings because they contain mercury, watch your wallet.&#8221; (Dental insurance will pay most of the cost of removing my remaining amalgam fillings.) In an essay last revised in 2006, Stephen &#8220;Quackwatch&#8221; Barrett <a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mercury.html">explained at length</a> why mercury toxicity is a &#8220;scam&#8221;. According to Barrett, &#8220;there is overwhelming evidence that amalgam fillings are safe.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>Albert  Einstein is reported to have said that insanity consists of doing the  same thing over and over again and expecting different results.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, if true, shows that Einstein was a theorist.</p>
<p>Call me insane. Based on many years of data collection, I believe <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf">scientific progress has a power-law distribution.</a> You sample from this distribution when you collect data. You collect data again and again &#8212; &#8220;doing the same thing over and over again&#8221;. Almost all the data you collect produces little progress; a tiny fraction produces great progress. The secret to scientific progress is doing the same thing over and over &#8212; and being wise enough to grasp that the results will vary greatly. (Nassim Taleb understands this.) In the short term, it seems like you are getting nowhere.</p>
<p>I learned this lesson from <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">my sleep research</a>. For ten years I tried various solutions to my problem of early awakening. Nothing worked. All my ideas were wrong. Eventually I got &#8220;lucky&#8221; but actually I made my own luck by persisting so long.</p>
<p>Once you realize the distribution of progress, you grasp that the secret of success is making the cost per sample as low as possible. Few scientists, in my experience, have figured this out. They prefer expensive experiments because larger grants signal higher status. <em>Won&#8217;t fancy equipment tell me more? </em>they rationalize. Grant givers, also failing to understand the basic point, are happy to oblige the status-seekers: Much easier to administer one $200,000 grant than 10 $20,000 grants. And progress slows to a crawl.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rita_Mae_Brown">Rita Mae Brown</a> is a more likely source of this saying than Albert Einstein.</p>

				<small>Monday, June 13th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21540421">A new study</a> in <em>JAMA</em> found higher salt consumption strongly associated with <strong>less </strong>death from heart disease. The association with total mortality (more salt, less death) was almost significant. To grasp the strength of the evidence, see <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/305/17/1777/F2.large.jpg">this</a>. Yes, it&#8217;s a correlation, but I don&#8217;t know of any examples of such a strong correlation reversing (so that more salt is now correlated with more death) when now-unknown confounders are taken into account. In 1998, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5379/898.short">Gary Taubes argued </a>that the benefits of salt reduction were greatly overstated. The new study did find more salt correlated with higher systolic blood pressure but in the big picture (mortality) that didn&#8217;t matter. If all those warnings about salt had any effect, the new study suggests their effect was negative.</p>
<p>Perhaps people who eat less salt are more credulous (they believed the experts) &#8212; and this damages them in other ways? Perhaps they rely on doctors more, for example. It is hard to interpret this finding in a way that makes mainstream health care look good. A <em></em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/health/research/04salt.html?ref=salt"><em>New York Times</em> article about the study</a> points out that &#8220;the new study is not the only one to find adverse effects of low-sodium diets.&#8221; And it reports what someone at the Centers for Disease Control said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dr. Peter Briss, a medical director at the centers, said that the study  was small; that its subjects were relatively young, with an average age  of 40 at the start; and that with few cardiovascular events, it was hard  to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>Dr. Briss fails to understand statistics. Ordinary statistical calculations take sample size and number of events into consideration when indicating the strength of the evidence. That&#8217;s the one of the main purposes of those calculations. As for &#8220;relatively young,&#8221; I know of nothing to suggest that the effects of sodium reverse with age &#8212; so it is irrelevant that the subjects were relatively young. That someone at the CDC is so clueless is remarkable.</p>
