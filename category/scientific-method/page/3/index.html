					<p>Persons with Type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. They are usually overweight. A study of about 5000 persons with Type 2 diabetes who were overweight or worse asked if eating less and exercise &#8212; causing weight loss &#8212; would reduce the risk. of heart disease and stroke. The difficult treatment caused  a small amount of weight loss (5%), which was enough to reduce risk factors. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/health/in-study-weight-loss-did-not-prevent-heart-attacks-in-diabetics.html" target="_blank">The study ended earlier than planned</a> because eating less and exercise didn&#8217;t help: &#8220;11 years after the study began, researchers concluded it was futile to continue — the two groups had nearly identical rates of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths.&#8221; <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/23/big-diet-and-exercise-study-fails-to-find-benefit/#more-7913" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Thursday, October 11th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1367547">A recent experiment published in JAMA</a>, one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world, found that giving people a very large dose of Vitamin D (100,000 IU) once/month did not prevent colds, even though it greatly increased blood levels of Vitamin D. This finding supports <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/">my view that it is important to take Vitamin D in the morning</a>. (Because a study in which this wasn&#8217;t done found no effect.) My view implies that blood levels may not matter &#8212; you can get high levels of Vitamin D by taking it at what I consider the wrong times of day. The usual thinking about Vitamin D has been that blood level is all that matters.</p>
<p>The editors of JAMA considered the Vitamin D study so important that they asked someone (<a href="http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/profile/person/78748">Dr. Jeffrey Linder</a>, associated with Harvard Medical School) to write a commentary &#8212; an associated editorial that puts the new finding in context.</p>
<p><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1367448">Linder&#8217;s commentary</a> (might be gated) is important because (a) it is a kind of random sample of how top research doctors think (he was selected to write it) and (b) he completely fails to grasp that the time of day Vitamin D is taken might matter. Colds, the immune system, sleep, time of day &#8212; it&#8217;s not far-fetched. When you do an experiment to see if X causes Y, and find no effect, I believe that there are usually many possible reasons other than X never causes Y.  Something was wrong with the equipment, something was wrong with your X (e.g., it was stale), something was wrong with your measurements (e.g., ceiling effect), and on and on. Linder did not see it this way.</p>
<blockquote><p>The 2011 IOM report called for additional research to determine whether vitamin D therapy reduces the incidence of respiratory tract infections. The VIDARIS trial [= the new study] has rigorously addressed this question. Results suggest that vitamin D should join the therapies listed in the Cochrane reviewsas being ineffective for preventing or treating upper respiratory tract infections in healthy adults.</p></blockquote>
<p>He seriously thinks one null result proves something. Sure, the new study is &#8220;rigorous&#8221; in certain ways. But it was far from exhaustive. It did not explore the many ways Vitamin D may be given, for example. It did not consider the possibility that blood levels don&#8217;t matter. Linder&#8217;s combination of (a) interest in rigor and (b) failure to understand the importance of exhaustive reminds me of a friend. When she was in 1st grade she had a pile of pennies. She knew how many she had &#8212; she had counted them. However, she did not know how to subtract. When she spent some of her pennies, to find out how many she had left she had to count them all over again.</p>
<p>My friend had half the skills an accountant needs. Linder&#8217;s commentary reflects only half the skills a scientist needs. To the extent that he is representative of top research doctors, this is shocking. It is as if most accountants at Arthur Andersen didn&#8217;t know how to subtract.</p>
<p>I have asked Dr. Linder if he has any response. If he does, I will post it.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A year and a half ago, the father of a friend of mine started taking Vitamin D3, 5000 IU/day at around 7 am &#8212; soon after getting up. That his regimen is exactly what I&#8217;d recommend (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/">good dose, good time of day</a>) is a coincidence &#8212; he doesn&#8217;t read this blog. He used to get 3 or 4 terrible colds every year, year after year. Since he started the Vitamin D3, he hasn&#8217;t gotten any. &#8220;A huge lifestyle improvement,&#8221; said my friend. His dad studied engineering at Caltech and is a considerable skeptic about new this and that.</p>
<p>Much more recently his mother changed the time of day she took her usual dose of Vitamin D3. For years she had been taking half in the morning (with a calcium supplement) and half at night. Two weeks ago she started taking the whole dose in the morning. Immediately &#8212; the first night &#8212; her sleep improved. She used to wake up every 2 hours. Since taking the Vitamin D3 in the morning, she has been waking up only every 3-6 hours. A few days ago, my friend reports she had &#8220;her best sleep in years&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sleep and immune function are linked in many ways beyond the fact that we sleep more when we&#8217;re sick. A molecule that promotes sleep turned out to be very close to a molecule that produces fever, for example. I found that when I did two things to improve my sleep (more standing, more morning light) <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I stopped getting colds</a>. So it makes sense that a treatment that improves one (sleep or immune function) would also improve the other (immune function or sleep).</p>
<p>A few days ago <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/07/assorted-links-213/">I posted a link</a> about <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1367547">a recent Vitamin D study that  found no effect of Vitamin D on colds</a>. The study completely neglected importance of time of day by giving one large injection of Vitamin D (100,000 IU) per month at unspecified time. I commented: &#8220;One more Vitamin D experiment that failed to have subjects take the Vitamin D early in the morning — the time it appears most likely to have a good effect.&#8221; These two stories, which I learned about after that post, support my comment. What&#8217;s interesting is that the researchers who do Vitamin D studies keep failing to take time of day into account and keep failing to find an effect and keep failing to figure out why. I have gathered <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/">23 anecdotes</a> that suggest that their studies are failing because they are failing to make sure their subjects take their Vitamin D early in the morning. Yet these researchers, if they resemble most medical researchers, <strong>disparage anecdotes</strong>. (Disparagement of anecdotes reaches its apotheosis in &#8220;evidence-based medicine&#8221;.) The same anecdotes that, I believe, contain the information they need to do a successful Vitamin D clinical trial. Could there be a serious problem with how Vitamin D researchers are trained to do research? A better approach would be to study anecdotes to get ideas about causation and then test those ideas. This isn&#8217;t complicated or hard to understand, but I haven&#8217;t heard of it being taught. If you understand this method, you treasure anecdotes rather than dismiss them (&#8220;anecdotal evidence&#8221;).</p>

					<p>My personal science introduced me to a research method I have never seen used in research articles or described in discussions of scientific method. It might be called <strong>wait and see</strong>. You measure something repeatedly, day after day, with the hope that at some point it will change dramatically and you will be able to determine why. In other words: 1. Measure something repeatedly, day after day. 2. When you notice an outlier, test possible explanations. In most science, random (= unplanned) variation is bad. In an experiment, for example, it makes the effects of the treatment harder to see. Here it is good.</p>
<p>Here are examples where wait and see paid off for me:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Acne and benzoyl peroxide</strong>. When I was a graduate student, I started counting the number of pimples on my face every morning. One day the count improved. It was two days after I started using benzoyl peroxide more regularly. Until then, I did not think benzoyl peroxide worked well &#8212; I started using it more regularly because I had run out of tetracycline (which turned out not to work).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Sleep and breakfast</strong>. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/">I changed my breakfast from oatmeal to fruit</a> because a student told me he had lost weight eating foods with high water content (such as fruit). I did not lose weight but my sleep suddenly got worse. I started waking up early every morning instead of half the time. From this I figured out that any breakfast, if eaten early, disturbed my sleep.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Sleep and standing</strong> (twice). <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/">I started to stand a lot to see if it would cause weight loss</a>. It didn&#8217;t, but I started to sleep better. Later, I discovered by accident that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/03/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">standing on one leg to exhaustion made me sleep better</a>.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Brain function and butter</strong>. For years I measured how fast I did arithmetic. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/13/arithmetic-and-butter/">One day I was a lot faster than usual. It turned out to be due to butter</a>.</p>
<p>5.<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/26/damage-due-to-mercury-revealed-by-brain-test/"><strong> Brain function and dental amalgam</strong></a>. My brain function, measured by an arithmetic test, improved over several months. I eventually decided that removal of two mercury-containing fillings was the likely cause.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Blood sugar and walking</strong>. My fasting blood sugar used to be higher than I would like &#8212; in the 90s. (Optimal is low 80s.) Even worse, it seemed to be increasing. (Above 100 is &#8220;pre-diabetic.&#8221;) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/">One day I discovered it was much lower than expected</a> (in the 80s). The previous day I had walked for an hour, which was unusual. I determined it was indeed cause and effect. If I walked an hour per day, my fasting blood sugar was much better.</p>
<p>This method and examples emphasize the point that different scientific methods are good at different things and we need all of them (in contrast to evidence-based medicine advocates who say some types of evidence are &#8220;better&#8221; than other types &#8212; implying one-dimensional evaluation). One thing we want to do is <strong>test cause-effect ideas</strong> (X causes Y). This method doesn&#8217;t do that at all. Experiments do that well, surveys are better than nothing. Another thing we want to do is <strong>assess the generality of our cause-effect ideas</strong>. This method doesn&#8217;t do that at all. Surveys do that well (it is much easier to survey a wide range of people than do an experiment with a wide range of people), multi-person experiments are better than nothing. A third thing we want to do is <strong>come up with cause-effect ideas worth testing</strong>. Most experiments are a poor way to do this, surveys are better than nothing. This method is especially good for that.</p>
<p>The possibility of such discoveries is a good reason to self-track. Professional scientists almost never use this method. But you can.</p>

					<p>I majored in psychology at Reed College. At the time, the whole major centered on Skinnerian psychology &#8212; the importance of reward in controlling behavior. The introductory course used a Skinnerian textbook (e.g., we learned the correct meaning of &#8220;negative reinforcement&#8221; &#8212; it does not mean punishment). Other courses also had a Skinnerian emphasis. They never convinced me. I always thought it was an exceedingly narrow way to study behavior.</p>
<p>When I was a graduate student, I visited Harvard and heard Skinner give a talk, titled &#8220;Why I am not a cognitive psychologist&#8221;. During the question period I asked if he was familiar with the work of Saul Sternberg &#8212; perhaps the most influential cognitive psychologist.<em> No</em>, said Skinner. I thought it was foolish to criticize an area of research you know little about.</p>
<p>After I became a professor, I went back to Reed to give a talk. After the talk, I went out to dinner with several psychology professors. I told them I thought Skinner was a brilliant engineer &#8212; the Skinner box is really useful &#8212; but a mediocre scientist. He was unable to discover anything, he just repeated the same result (rewarding something increases how often it is done) countless times. They had no reply.</p>
<p>In the last two days, strangely enough, Skinner has come up in two different conversations. In the first, a friend said that Skinner&#8217;s views about language were ridiculous. I agreed. <em>Why write such nonsense?</em> my friend asked/complained. I said maybe Skinner&#8217;s productivity system worked too well. It caused him to write when he had nothing to say. In the second, a different friend brought up <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/06/the-perfected-self/8970/#">David Freedman&#8217;s recent Atlantic article</a> called &#8220;The Perfected Self&#8221;, which argues that Skinnerian techniques really work when you implement them as smartphone apps &#8212; techniques to lose weight, for example. &#8220;B. F. Skinner’s notorious theory of behavior modification was denounced by critics 50 years ago as a fascist, manipulative vehicle for government control,&#8221; writes Freedman (or an editor), but actually that theory is really good.</p>
<p>My area of academic psychology (animal learning) is the same as Skinner&#8217;s. Within this field, I have never heard anyone complain that Skinner&#8217;s work was &#8220;fascist&#8221; or &#8220;manipulative&#8221; or a &#8220;vehicle for government control.&#8221; It never became popular &#8212; it was always a minority point of view &#8212; probably because it was boring (the same thing over and over) and perhaps because it was anti-intellectual. Skinner wrote a well-known paper about why theories are unnecessary. He didn&#8217;t understand the role of theories in science and didn&#8217;t bother to find out. Sure, the psychology theories of the time (1950) were awful. Psychology theories are still mostly awful. But there are plenty of good theories in other areas of science.</p>
<p>For a long time, Skinnerian ideas, nearly dead in academia, lived on in the treatment of autism. The people applying these ideas called themselves &#8220;behavior analysts&#8221; and the whole field of applied Skinnerian psychology was called &#8220;behavior analysis&#8221;. What caused this persistence was that the techniques worked. Using the techniques (carefully rewarding this or that behavior) improved the lives of autistic children and their parents. Which was a real contribution. I could make a long list of famous psychologists who have done less to improve human well-being.</p>
<p>The success of Skinnerian ideas in improving the lives of autistic children should not be confused with figuring out what causes autism. To figure out the cause of autism is to figure out the environmental cause(s) &#8212; to which people with certain genes are more sensitive &#8212; and how autism can be avoided entirely, not meliorated. I have blogged about possible causes of autism <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/autism/">many times</a>, in particular the possibility that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/autism/sonograms-and-autism/">sonograms cause autism</a>. I have no idea if behavior analysts understand the difference between melioration and figuring out the cause. Maybe Skinner would claim there is no difference &#8212; he was full of bizarre statements like that. If your child is autistic, you are in crisis. You have zero interest in questions about &#8220;cause&#8221; &#8212; you simply want help. In any form. Behavior analysts, while helping autistic children and their parents, contribute nothing that helps us find the cause of autism. Which, if you are planning on having children, you care about enormously. So you can avoid having autistic children.</p>
<p>So Skinner&#8217;s legacy is mixed. The Skinner box is terrific. I happily used them in my research for years, even though I hardly believed a single word Skinner said. As an engineer &#8212; an applier of stuff discovered by others &#8212; Skinner made a lasting contribution. As a self-promoter, he was incredibly successful &#8212; he was on the cover of <em>Time</em>, for example. As a scientist, he was a zero. He discovered nothing that matters. As a thinker (e.g., the book <em>Beyond Freedom and Dignity</em>) he was less than zero. He was a charlatan, claiming over and over that he understood puzzling things (e.g., language) that he did not understand. An unusual mix. Few great engineers are charlatans.</p>

				<small>Saturday, July 28th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/96/2/382.abstract">A new epidemiological study</a> followed about 16,000 people in Europe for about 12 years and focused on their dairy intake. Did the ones who came down with diabetes eat differently from those who didn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>The paper begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>Current dietary guidelines for prevention of diabetes aim at substituting SFAs [saturated fatty acids] with unsaturated fatty acids. However, conventionally held notions that all SFAs, including those from dairy products, are detrimental to health have recently been challenged.</p></blockquote>
<p>The shift of evidence (dairy less bad than previously believed) supports my view that what&#8217;s good for the brain (I found butter was good for my brain) is likely to be good for the rest of the body. The paper&#8217;s main conclusion is the possible protective value of cheese and yogurt:</p>
<blockquote><p>This large prospective study found no association between total dairy product intake and diabetes risk. An inverse association of cheese intake and combined fermented dairy product [= cheese, yogurt, and "thick fermented milk"] intake with diabetes is suggested.</p></blockquote>
<p>The combined fermented dairy association was not large in size (a risk reduction of 12%) but was significant (barely). When your main finding is barely significant you have no hope of using your data to explain it so the new information essentially stops there. The results support my view that fermented foods are unusually healthy.</p>
<p>In response to these findings, the director of research at Diabetes UK <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9422230/Cheese-could-reduce-diabetes-risk.html">said</a>, “This study gives us no reason to believe that people should change their dairy intake in an attempt to avoid [diabetes].” Wow. It is as if a prominent physicist said the earth was flat.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, July 10th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>Prize Fight: The Race and Rivalry to be First in Science </em>(2012) by Morton Meyers (copy sent me by publisher) is about battles/disagreements over credit, often within a lab. Jocelyn Bell noticed the first quasar &#8212; how much credit does she deserve relative to her advisor, Anthony Hewish, who built the structure within which she worked? (Not much, said Bell. &#8220;I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were given to research students.&#8221;) The structure and subtitle of the book make little sense &#8212; there is a chapter about how science resembles art and a chapter about data fabrication, for instance, and nothing about races or being first. The core of the book is two stories about credit: for the discovery of streptomycin, the first drug effective against tuberculosis, and for the invention of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Meyers is a radiology professor and a colleague of one of the inventors of MRI.</p>
<p>I liked both stories. I find it hard to learn anything unless there is emotion involved. Both stories are emotional &#8212; people got angry &#8212; which made it easy to learn the science. Streptomycin was found by screening dirt. It was already known that dirt kills microbes. The graduate student who made the discovery was indeed a cog in a machine but later he was mistreated and got angry and sued. The first MRI-like machine was built by a doctor named Raymond Damadian, who was not one of the recipients of the Nobel Prize given out for its invention. He had good cause to be furious. The otherwise good science writer Horace Freeland Judson wrote an op-ed piece about it (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/opinion/no-nobel-prize-for-whining.html">&#8220;No Nobel Prize for Whining&#8221;</a>) that ended &#8220;His behavior stands in stark and elegant contrast to the noisy complaining of Raymond Damadian&#8221;. To name-call (&#8220;whining&#8221;, &#8220;noisy&#8221;) in a <em>New York Times </em>op-ed is to suggest your case is weak.</p>
<p>I have had a related experience. When I was a graduate student, at Brown University, I did experiments about cross-model use of an internal clock. Do rats use the same clock to measure the duration of sound and the duration of light? (Yes.) I got the idea from human experiments about cross-modal transfer. By the time <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7057141">my paper</a> (&#8220;Cross-Modal Use of an Internal Clock&#8221;) appeared, I was an assistant professor. A few months after it was published, I went back to Brown to visit my advisor, Russell Church. On the day of my visit, he had just received a new issue of the main journal in our field (<em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal  Behavior Processes</em> &#8212; where my article appeared). It was in a brown wrapper on his desk. I opened it. The second article was <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1983-04976-001">&#8220;Abstraction of Temporal Attributes&#8221;</a> by Warren Meck and Russell Church. (Meck was a graduate student with Church.) I didn&#8217;t know about it. It was based on my work. The first experiment was the same (except for trivial details) as the first experiment of my article. The introduction did not mention me. I leafed through it. Buried in the middle it said &#8220;This result replicates previous reports from our laboratory (Meck &amp; Church, in press; Roberts, 1982).&#8221;</p>
<p>I was angry. <em>Why did you do this?</em> I asked Church. &#8220;To make it seem more important,&#8221; he said. I consoled myself by thinking how bad it looked (on Church&#8217;s record). <em></em>I never visited him, and almost never spoke to him, again. Years later I was asked to speak at a conference session honoring him. I declined. What he did amounted to rich (well-established) stealing from poor (not established) and jeopardized my career. When my article appeared, I didn&#8217;t have tenure. It was far from certain I would get it. I hadn&#8217;t written many papers. If you read both papers (Meck and Church, and mine), you could easily be confused: <em>Who copied who?</em>  This confusion reduced the credit I got for my work and reduced my chance of getting tenure. Church surely knew this. Failure to get tenure could have ended my career.</p>

					<p>In <a href="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/watergate.htm">a great essay</a>, Edward Jay Epstein points out, at least by implication, that the Pulitzer Prize committee is not terribly interested in the truth of things:</p>
<blockquote><p>A sustaining myth of journalism holds that every great government scandal is revealed through the work of enterprising reporters who by one means or another pierce the official veil of secrecy. . .  This view of journalistic revelation is propagated by the press even in cases where journalists have had palpably little to do with the discovery of corruption. Pulitzer Prizes were thus awarded this year to the Wall Street journal for &#8220;revealing&#8221; the scandal which forced Vice President Agnew to resign and to the Washington Star/News for &#8220;revealing&#8221; the campaign contribution that led to the indictments of former cabinet officers Maurice Starts and John N. Mitchell, although reporters at neither newspaper in actual fact had anything to do with uncovering the scandals. . . . Yet to perpetuate the myth that the members of the press were the prime movers in such great events as the conviction of a Vice President and the indictment of two former cabinet officers, the Pulitzer Prize committee simply chose the news stories nearest to these events and awarded them its honors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Nobel Prize in Biology committee operates the same way, except with the disadvantage that there is not one important (= useful in a big way) biology discovery per year. There are far fewer than that. So almost every year the Nobel Prize in Biology goes to discoveries with little practical importance that are described as having great practical importance. The profession (in this case, biology) is credited with much more power than it actually has.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? One possible reason is that no one points it out. (Epstein&#8217;s essay, still relevant today, was published in 1974.) When a powerful journalistic institution does bad things, it is incredibly dangerous (to your career) to point this out. This is why the Murdoch scandal is so big &#8212; it went on so long.<em> Spy</em> magazine had a column called Review of Reviewers. It was hilarious because the misdeeds were great. Unlike almost anything else in <em>Spy</em>, the author was anonymous. Brilliant writing that the author did not take credit for because it was dangerous to criticize the watchdogs. Likewise, hardly anyone except Epstein criticizes the prize committees (who resemble watchdogs) so they can be profoundly inaccurate.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A few days ago I gave <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2012-05-27-The-Rise-of-Personal-Science.pptx">a talk at Microsoft Beijing</a> titled &#8220;The Rise of Personal Science: Discoveries about Acne, Blood Sugar, Mood, Weight Loss, Sleep, and Brain Function.&#8221; (Thanks to Richard Sprague, who invited me.) The audience was engineers. </p>
<p>In response to a question, I said that the relationship between personal science and professional science resembled the relationship between professional science and engineering. Cause-effect statements (X causes Y) vary in their degree of plausibility anywhere from zero (can&#8217;t possibly be true) to one (absolute certainty). Engineers, professional scientists, and personal scientists tend to work at different places along this scale:</p>
<p><strong>Engineers</strong> work with cause-effect relationships at the top of the scale, that are well-established. (For example, Newton&#8217;s Laws.) Relationships in which we have total confidence. </p>
<p><strong>Professional scientists</strong> like to study cause-effect relationships that are in the middle of the scale of degree of belief: true and false are equally plausible. When both true and false are plausible, you can publish the results no matter what you find. If everyone already agrees that X causes Y, further evidence isn&#8217;t publishable &#8212; too obvious. If it is highly implausible that X causes Y, professional scientists cannot study the question because a test of whether X causes Y is too unlikely to pay off. If you find that X does cause Y you can publish it but that&#8217;s too unlikely. Finding that X does not cause Y is unpublishable (&#8220;we already knew that&#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>Personal scientists</strong> can easily test ideas with low plausibility. First, because personal science is cheap. Many tests cost nothing. Second, because what other people think is irrelevant. (A professional scientist who takes seriously an idea that &#8220;everyone knows is nonsense&#8221; risks loss of reputation.) Third, because there is no pressure to produce a steady stream of publications. An example of a personal scientist testing an idea with low plausibility is when I tested the idea that standing causes weight loss. I thought it was unlikely (and, indeed, I didn&#8217;t lose weight when I stood much more than usual). But I could easily test it. It led me to discover that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">standing a lot improves my sleep</a>.</p>
<p>Plainly we need all three (engineers, professional scientists, personal scientists). Has anyone reading this heard someone besides me make this point?</p>
<p>I have been shocked &#8212; I sort of continue to be shocked &#8212; how much I have been able to discover via personal science. But a high rate of discovery makes sense if personal science supplies a necessary ingredient &#8212; ability to test low-plausibility ideas &#8212; that has been missing.</p>

					<p>Drug companies, in a few cases, have<a href="http://the-scientist.com/2012/05/01/data-diving/"> recently started to release much more data from drug trials</a>. Unsurprisingly, analysis of the new data by outsiders &#8212; people who have nothing to gain from positive results &#8212; has often contradicted the drug company analysis of the same data.</p>
<p>One example involves the flu drug Tamiflu. The new analysis suggested that &#8220;Tamiflu falls short of claims—not just that it ameliorates flu complications, but also that the drug reduces the transmission of influenza.&#8221; Another example involved Prozac. The new analysis &#8220;ended up bucking much of the published literature on antidepressants. . . . [It]found no link between Prozac and suicide risk among children and young adults . . . Prozac appeared to be more effective in youth, and antidepressants far less efficacious in the elderly, than previously thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another reason to believe in the value of this new data is the work of Lisa Bero at UCSF. She looked at the efficacy of nine drugs using unpublished FDA data. &#8220;Nineteen of the redone analyses showed a drug to be more efficacious, while 19 found a drug to be less efficacious. The one harm analysis that was reanalyzed showed more harm from the drug than had been reported.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope that the FDA will eventually require that all raw data from drug trials be publicly available as a condition of approval. (The same should also be true of journal articles, as a condition of publication.) It is abundantly clear that drug company analyses are often misleading &#8212; which harms the public.</p>

<li><a href="http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2012/04/how-grant-chasing-corrupts-science.html">The corruption of science by research grants</a>. This reminds me of a BBC documentary called something like Science Under Attack. It was hosted by a Nobel Prize winner (Biology) named Paul Nurse. Part of it was about &#8220;climate change denialism&#8221;.  If you don&#8217;t believe that humans are dangerously warming the planet, Nurse implied, you are somehow attacking science. When people who win Nobel Prizes cannot see that AGW is a crock, something curious has happened.</li>

					<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-07-sudden-unexplained-decrease-and-increase-in-speed.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6277" title="2012-04-07 sudden unexplained decrease and increase in speed" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-07-sudden-unexplained-decrease-and-increase-in-speed-1024x489.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a>This is me a few days ago. I did a choice reaction time task many times. Each dot is a session with enough trials to supply 32 correct answers.The y axis is in &#8220;percentile&#8221; units, meaning speed relative to recent performance. If my speed was at the average of recent performance, the percentile would be 50, for example. Higher percentiles = better performance = faster (shorter reaction time). Each point is a mean; the vertical bars are standard errors. The dotted line is the median of the means.</p>
<p>The graph shows that Friday afternoon I was suddenly unusually slow. After dinner, I returned to normal. A change from 60%ile to 20%ile to 60%ile resembles an IQ change from 105 to 87 to 105 (an 18-point change).</p>
<p>At the same time accuracy was roughly constant:</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-07-sudden-unexplained-decrease-and-increase-in-speed-accuracy.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6278" title="2012-04-07 sudden unexplained decrease and increase in speed (accuracy)" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012-04-07-sudden-unexplained-decrease-and-increase-in-speed-accuracy-1024x489.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>Because accuracy was roughly constant, the change in speed was not due to a shift on a speed-accuracy tradeoff function.</p>
<p>There are two puzzles here. 1. Why were my scores low Friday afternoon? 2. Why did they recover after dinner? On Friday I didn&#8217;t feel well. As a result, I didn&#8217;t eat much. Maybe my blood sugar was lower than usual. I usually eat 30 g butter twice/day. On Friday I didn&#8217;t have any. At dinner I did have moderate amounts of pork fat (but not butter) and sugar (in lemon citron tea). Friday 6 pm I had a cup of black tea. Although I haven&#8217;t noticed effects of tea on these scores, there&#8217;s a first time for everything.</p>
<p>Here is a clue to what makes my brain work well (= fast), I conclude. Butter causes sudden improvement, I have found; which makes it plausible that lack of butter (and other animal fat) could cause sudden degradation. Another possibility was that my blood sugar was low Friday afternoon. (I didn&#8217;t think of this at the time, and didn&#8217;t measure it.)  I&#8217;m surprised that something as important as brain function would be as fragile as these results imply. When various nutrient deficiencies are studied with conventional measures, it generally takes weeks or months without the nutrient for the bad effects to become apparent. It takes many weeks without Vitamin C to get scurvy, for example.</p>
<p>These results raise the intriguing possibility that everyone has sudden ups and downs in brain function and that these ups and downs can be detected at high signal/noise ratios. If so, we can use these ups and downs to learn how to make our brains work well. These results also imply &#8212; because my choice reaction time test required only a laptop &#8212; that anyone can detect them, study them, and learn what causes them. No experts needed. What a change that would be.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html">a recent editorial in <em>Nature</em></a> (gated), the research head of a drug company complained that scientists working for him could not repeat almost all of the &#8220;landmark&#8221; findings in cancer research that they tried to repeat. They wanted to use these findings as a basis for new drugs.  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-science-cancer-idUSBRE82R12P20120328">An article in <em>Reuters</em></a> summarized it like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>During a decade as head of global cancer research at Amgen, C. Glenn Begley identified 53 &#8220;landmark&#8221; publications &#8212; papers in top journals, from reputable labs &#8212; for his team to reproduce. Begley sought to double-check the findings before trying to build on them for drug development. Result: 47 of the 53 could not be replicated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet these findings were cited, on average, about 200 times. The editorial goes on to make reasonable suggestions for improvement based on differences between the findings that could be repeated and those that could not. The <em>Reuters</em> article goes on to describe other examples of lack of reproducibility and includes a story about why this is happening:</p>
<blockquote><p>Part way through his project to reproduce promising studies, Begley met for breakfast at a cancer conference with the lead scientist of one of the problematic studies. &#8220;We went through the paper line by line, figure by figure,&#8221; said Begley. &#8220;I explained that we re-did their experiment 50 times and never got their result. He said they&#8217;d done it six times and got this result once, but put it in the paper because it made the best story.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, cancer research is less trustworthy than someone just barely outside it (Begley) ever guessed. Apparently careerism is one reason why. What is unexplained in both the <em>Nature</em> editorial and the <em>Reuters</em> summary is how research can ever succeed if things aren&#8217;t reproducible. Science has been compared to a game of Twenty Questions. Suppose you play Twenty Questions and 25% of the answers are wrong. It&#8217;s hopeless. In experimental research, you generally build on previous experimental results. The editorial points out that the non-reproducible results had been cited 200 times but what about how often they had been reproduced in other labs? The editorial says nothing about this.</p>
<p>I can think of several possibilities: (a) Current lab research is based on experimental findings of thirty years ago when (for unknown reasons) careerism was less of a problem. Standards were higher, there was less pressure to publish, whatever. (b) There is a silent invisible &#8220;survival of the reproducible&#8221;: Findings that can be reproduced live on because people do lab work based on them. The other findings are cited but are not the basis of new work. (c) There is lots of redundancy &#8212; different people approach the same question in different ways. Although each individual answer is not very trustworthy their average is considerably more trustworthy.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the mystery (how can science make any progress if so many results are not reproducible?), the lack of reproducibility interests me because it suggests that the pressure to publish faced by professional scientists has serious (bad) consequences. In contrast, personal scientists are under zero pressure to publish.</p>

					<p>A reader asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>I haven&#8217;t found much on your blog commenting on tools you use to track your data. Any recommendations? Have you tried smart phones? For example, I have tried tracking fifteen variables daily via the iPhone app Moodtracker, the only one I found that can track and graph multiple variables and also give you automated reminders to submit data. There are other variants (Data Logger, Daytum) that will graph one variable (say, miles run per day), but Moodtracker is the only app I&#8217;ve found that lets you analyze multiple variables.</p></blockquote>
<p>I use R on a laptop to track and analyze my data.  I write functions for doing this &#8212; they are not built-in. This particular reader hadn&#8217;t heard of R. It is free and the most popular software among statisticians. It has lots of built-in functions (although not for data collection &#8212; apparently statisticians rarely collect data) and provides lots of control over the graphs you make, which is very important. R also has several programs for fitting loess curves to your data. Loess is a kind of curve-fitting. There is a vast amount of R-related material, including introductory stuff, <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>To give an example, after I weigh myself each morning (I have three scales), I enter the three weights into R, which stores them and makes a graph. That&#8217;s on the simple side. At the other extreme are the various mental tests I&#8217;ve written (e.g., arithmetic) to measure how well my brain is working. The programs for doing the test are in R, the data is stored in R, and analyzed with R.</p>
<p>The analysis possibilities (e.g., the graphs you can make, your control over those graphs) I&#8217;ve seen on smart phone apps are hopelessly primitive for what I want to do. The people who write the analysis software seem to know almost nothing about data analysis. For example, I use a website called <a href="https://www.ranktracer.com">RankTracer</a> to track the Amazon ranking of <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>. Whoever wrote the software is so clueless the rank versus time graphs don&#8217;t even show log ranks.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the future holds. In academic psychology, there is near-total reliance on statistical packages (e.g., SPSS) that are so limited perhaps they can extract only half of the information in the usual data. There are many graphs you&#8217;d like to make that it is impossible to make. SPSS may not even have loess, for example. Yet I see no sign of this changing. Will personal scientists want to learn more from their data than psychology professors (and therefore be motivated to go beyond pre-packaged analyses)? I don&#8217;t know.</p>

				<small>Sunday, January 22nd, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>One hundred years ago (January, 1912), at the annual meeting of the Geological Association in Frankfurt, Germany, Alfred Wegener, a meteorologist, presented his theory of continental drift for the first time. It was almost uniformly dismissed by geologists. One of them called it <a href="http://pangaea.org/wegener.htm">&#8220;mere geopoetry&#8221;</a>. Much later, he was proved right.</p>
<p>To me, this is a classic example of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/scientific-method/insideroutsider/">the power of what I call <em>insider/outsiders</em></a>. Wegener had a great deal of scientific training, including a Ph.D. in astronomy. Unlike professional geologists, however, (a) he had the freedom to say whatever he wanted about geology without endangering his job (as a meteorologist) or prospects for advancement and (b) was under no pressure to publish. He could spend as much time on his theory as he wanted.</p>
