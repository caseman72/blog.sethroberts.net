				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Via a website, I asked about the flavonoid content of Dove dark chocolate. In China, a package of Dove dark chocolate has a picture of a heart &#8212; meaning the food is &#8220;heart-healthy&#8221;. <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4488" target="_blank">The heart benefits</a> are believed to come from flavonoids. Mars has been exploring this idea in various ways, such as <a href="http://www.cocoapro.com/about_cocoapro.html" target="_blank">this special process</a> and <a href="http://www.cocoavia.com/" target="_blank">these special chocolates</a>.</p>
<p>An email from Mars said I should call a hotline. The woman who answered did not know what flavonoids are. &#8220;Do you want to know the cocoa content?&#8221; she asked more than once. <em>No, the flavonoid content</em>, I said. She looked. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have that information,&#8221; she said. Haha!</p>
<p>I said the flavonoids in chocolate are believed to be responsible for the health benefits of chocolate. (That&#8217;s true, but I might have said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavanols" target="_blank"><em>flavanols</em></a> &#8212; a type of flavonoid &#8212; instead of the much broader term <em>flavonoid</em>.) &#8220;We don&#8217;t make health claims for our chocolates,&#8221; the Mars representative said. (As if a picture of a heart on a package is not a health claim. No doubt there is an important difference between US and Chinese law.) <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/dannon-settles-lawsuit/story?id=9950269" target="_blank">I can see why she would say that</a>. Our brilliant government, protecting us from crazy ideas such as chocolate and yogurt are healthy, but not from the <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/12/cancer-free-i-beat-prostate-cancer-mish.html" target="_blank">exaggerations of doctors</a> and drug companies. Which is more dangerous, (a) eating chocolate or yogurt or (b) being cut open?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I slept great. I woke up feeling very rested. I can remember only three situations when I woke up feeling more refreshed. (a) On a certain camping trip. (b) When I was on my feet for ten hours. (c) After eating a lot of pork fat. I cannot simulate camping trips, and standing ten hours/day was very hard. The pork-fat effect was repeatable, in the sense that I slept better after eating pork fat, but I never ate that much pork fat again. It was too much.</p>
<p>Why did I sleep so well? I can think of several possible reasons.</p>
<p>1. Random noise. Let&#8217;s say there are 20 factors that affect my sleep and they just happened to all line up in a good direction.</p>
<p>Another set of possible reasons derive from what was unusual about yesterday. I can think of five things:</p>
<p>2. I had yogurt and blueberries and honey about 6:30 pm. (In addition to 1 tablespoon honey at bedtime.)</p>
<p>3. I forgot to hang a blackout curtain that darkens my bedroom. Usually I hang two. Last night, by mistake, only one.</p>
<p>4. I started eating dark chocolate daily two days ago. Maybe the good stuff in it (the flavones) accumulates in the brain so that the good effects get larger day by day.</p>
<p>5. I watched faces in the morning a half-hour later than usual. Usually I start watching them at 6:00 am. Yesterday I started at 6:30 am. I had forgotten about this difference until I looked at my records.</p>
<p>6. I switched to a new brand of honey (from a German brand to a Canadian one).</p>
<p>#1 is unlikely. #2 vaguely corresponds to the idea that honey helps us sleep because it supplies energy. Maybe honey at 6:30 fills up the liver (with glycogen) and honey at bedtime goes into the blood. But I&#8217;ve eaten plenty of meals at 6:30 without any obvious effect. Maybe they were too low-carb. I don&#8217;t know if making my room very very dark (two curtains) is better than making my room dark (one curtain) but there is no obvious reason making my bedroom less dark would improve sleep (#3).  I have never heard anyone say chocolate (#4) improved their sleep. Morning faces did improve sleep but the mood improvement was much more obvious (#5). I&#8217;ve tried several brands of honey; there was no obvious difference between them, arguing against #6.</p>
<p>As the day wore on I found myself in a good mood but not a great mood, arguing against #5.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say #2 is the most plausible, the rest less plausible, with #1 the least plausible. But I will test all of them.</p>
<p><strong>More (a day later)</strong> I did #3 (only one curtain), #4 (chocolate), #5 (later faces), and #6 (new honey) again. I did not sleep exceptionally well. That makes #1 and #2 more plausible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I interviewed Patrick Pineda about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/11/how-things-begin-tisano-tea/" target="_blank">how Tisano Tea began</a>, he gave me several tins of chocolate tea, their main product. Since then, I&#8217;ve had dozens of cups of chocolate tea. It&#8217;s a good caffeine-free drink, especially with cream.</p>
<p>My main use of chocolate tea, however, has been to improve black tea. Black tea + chocolate tea = great drink, better than any black tea alone or chocolate tea alone. So much better that I have stopped drinking black tea the usual way (without chocolate tea). Even cheap black tea (e.g., Lipton&#8217;s) plus chocolate tea tastes better than expensive black tea. I think I know why. Black tea (fermented) has a complex flavor, like most fermented foods. Expensive black tea is more complex than cheap black tea, but only a little more. Likewise, chocolate tea has a complex flavor (like chocolate). Combining two sources of substantial complexity produces tea with great complexity &#8212; much more than you can get by tweaking one source of complexity (e.g., varying black tea).<span id="more-10675"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a recipe:</p>
<p>1. To 2.0 g of black tea and 0.9 g of chocolate tea add 8 oz of boiling water. Brew 4 minutes.</p>
<p>2. Add cream and sugar to taste.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.peets.com/" target="_blank">Peet&#8217;s</a> tea designers may have reached a similar conclusion.  Peet&#8217;s sells limited-edition teas that are available for only a few months, one at a time. Several months ago the limited-edition tea was Red Cloud Cacao, which combined black tea, chocolate tea, and rooibos. The chocolate tea was from Tisano. I loved it. It sold surprisingly well, I&#8217;m told. Their next limited-edition tea, still available, is <a href="http://www.peets.com/anniversary-breakfast-blend-tea-4-oz.html" target="_blank">Anniversary Breakfast Blend</a>. Here&#8217;s what the tin says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We seek out small lot teas with unique characters and intriguing flavors . . . Then . . . we set out to make great teas even better . . . We artfully marry the elements of distinctive black teas until we have achieved a well-balanced, extraordinarily aromatic, and flavorful cup.</p></blockquote>
<p>I told a Peet&#8217;s customer service person how much I liked the combination of black and chocolate tea. <em>That&#8217;s funny</em>, she said, <em>the Anniversary Breakfast Blend is made by adding a chocolate mist to black tea.</em> The blended teas are misted with chocolate. The website and the container say nothing about this. My guess is that the tea designers came to the same conclusion as me. Chocolate was so potent they couldn&#8217;t bear to omit it. But they couldn&#8217;t simply add chocolate tea to the blend, because that would repeat Red Cloud Cacao, appear formulaic, and spoil the story of &#8220;seek[ing] out small lot teas&#8221;. It would also be obvious: You could look at the tea and see the chocolate. So they used chocolate mist and didn&#8217;t tell customers. What the tin says is doughnut truth: The whole truth, nothing but the truth, with a hole in the truth.</p>
<p>Complexity is much different than other sources of pleasure in food (salty, sweet, chewy, etc.). <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/01/08/the-limits-of-expert-trial-and-error/" target="_blank">My explorations</a> suggest we can detect a lot more complexity that you can get from a single fermented food. But I have yet to encounter a single recipe that combines fermented foods. Most professional recipes produce complexity via many spices, which is labor-intensive (you need to add and adjust all those spices, and worry about their age) and, in my experience, produces no better results than adding one fermented flavoring, such as miso.</p>
<p><a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=682750" target="_blank">Salting tea</a> also seems to improve it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://tisano.com/" target="_blank">Tisano Tea</a>, based in San Francisco, sells chocolate tea. It was started in 2010 by Patrick Pineda, Leonardo Zambrano, and Lucas Azpurua. I was curious about the company because I like two chocolate tea blends very much: Red Cloud Cacao (a black tea/chocolate tea blend from Peet’s, no longer available but they will bring it back) and CocoMate (from <a href="http://www.americantearoom.com/" target="_blank">American Tea Room</a>).<span id="more-10390"></span></p>
<p>Patrick’s father was an ambassador from Venezuela. Patrick grew up in California and England and went to college at the University of East Anglia. After studying for a Master’s in Film Production from Columbia University (New York), he started working for Al Jazerra in Venezuela making documentaries. He also worked for a local TV station making segments for a children’s program. One segment was about cacao. He learned that Venezuelan cacao beans were among the most highly-valued cacao beans in the world. The cacao beans from one valley (Chuao) sold for ten times the usual price.</p>
<p>While making the segment, he met cacao farmers. He discovered a group of cacao farmers whose beans had been organically certified by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) due to local NGO sponsorship (the NGO paid for it). The farmers saw it as free training. The organic certification took lots of paperwork to maintain. The farmers had hoped that the certification would allow them to sell their beans at a premium. However, after four years, this hadn’t yet happened. At the end of each harvest, they’d had to sell their beans at the conventional (non-organic) price.</p>
<p>This struck Patrick as an opportunity – a niche (organic) within a niche (Venezualan). In the US, there was a growing demand for organic products. The co-op grew about 16 metric tons of organic cacao beans each year. In 2009, with the financial help of his older brother and friends, he bought 10 metric tons ($40,000). A month earlier, he hadn’t known that chocolate comes from cacao.</p>
<p>He soon realized there was a problem: How to get it out of the country? If taken straight out, the government would fumigate it and it would lose its organic certification. It would have to be processed in Venezuela. There were several cacao processing plants in Venezuela but to them 10 metric tons was nothing. Patrick finally convinced one of them that organic might be the future. He taught the employees how to process the beans organically while learning it himself. After that it was relatively easy to get the processing plant certified organic.</p>
<p>During processing, 12% of the weight is “lost” in shells that are normally discarded. Patrick took the shells with him back to America hoping he could do something with them. In Venezuela, he had met an indigenous tribal community that drank tea made from cacao shells as remedy for asthma and to sooth coughs. He looked academic journals for other uses. He eventually found about 120 published papers. The shells had been used as toothpaste and to increase the Vitamin D content of milk by feeding them to cows. The only common uses, it turned out, were as fertilizer (due to the nitrogen content) and animal feed (due to the fiber and Vitamin D content). Neither use was high-price.</p>
<p>What about tea? Patrick sent samples to his partners. They were unenthusiastic. “This tastes like grass. Why would anybody drink tea from a by-product?” However, he was selling chocolate butter and nibs online. With each order, he included an 8-ounce pouch of cacao shells with instructions how to brew the tea. His customers – at least, some of them – were enthusiastic: <em>How unique, how great</em>, they emailed him. A German woman said she hadn’t drunk such tea since World War II ended. During World War II, cacao shells had been added to tea to extend it. His customers wanted to buy more.</p>
<p>He convinced his partners to go to a trade show. In 2010, they went to Expo West, a natural and healthy food product show in Anaheim. Out of all of their products, the tea got the most attention. It won Best in Show for tea. Out of about 500 new products, it was one of four that won Best New Product of Show. People from Twinings Tea and Stash Tea complimented them on their product.</p>
<p>After the trade show, Patrick decided the tea was a good concept and decided to make it a separate brand. Dark chocolate without the guilt. No sugar, no caffeine. He launched Tisano. The name comes from <em>tisane</em> (herbal tea in French) and <em>artesano</em> (artisanal in Spanish).</p>
<p>When I tasted Tisano’s chocolate tea, it tasted very familiar. That’s because Tisano’s cacao shells are the cacao shells in both American Tea Room’s CocoMate and Peet’s Red Cloud Cacao. There is no doubt that Patrick has created a new niche within the American (and maybe world) tea market: chocolate tea. I don’t know how well CocoMate is selling at American Tea Room but I decided to buy it after smelling maybe 40 teas. At Peet’s, Red Cloud Cacao sold surprisingly well and they will bring it back seasonally.</p>

Treatment of symptoms rather than identification of causes is overwhelmingly true of the whole health care system, not just treatment of chronic pain. One example is depression. Anti-depressants do not reduce whatever caused the depression. Another example is high blood pressure. Blood-pressure-lowering drugs do nothing to eliminate what caused the high blood pressure. Duncan was once science editor of <em>New York</em> magazine, which may have something to do with her ability to cogently criticize the system.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toni Rivard, a Dallas dessert caterer, makes one of the best chocolate-chip cookies in America, <a href="http://www.forbestraveler.com/food-drink/best-cookies-2009-story.html">according to Forbes Traveller</a>. She ages her cookie dough about three days. She says it improves the texture. I wonder if it improves the flavor, too:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Rivardâ€™s secret? â€œI like to age my cookie dough and feel that it makes for a better texture in cookies. As a result, the aptly-named OMG! [which is what customers have actually said when they taste one] chocolate chip cookies at <strong>Creme de la Cookie </strong>are soft and chewy with a deep rich flavor. </span></p></blockquote>
<p>Fermenting cookie dough should certainly improve the flavor, although chocolate already supplies a lot of complexity. My experience has been that cooking delicious stuff became a lot easier when I started using fermentation to help (e.g., miso soup instead of soups flavored without fermented ingredients).</p>
<p>Thanks to David Archer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the Fancy Food Show, <a href="http://www.advancedgourmet.com/">Kriss Harvey</a>, a pastry chef and frozen dessert solutions specialist, served me a spoonful of powdered chocolate ice cream, his invention. It looked like chocolate ice cream but it tasted unlike any ice cream (or any food) I&#8217;ve ever had. It was there and not there. It was in my mouth and then it was gone. It was the most ethereal food I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p>We had been talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bulli">El Bulli</a>, the Spanish restaurant of experimental food. Two friends of Mr. Harvey&#8217;s had worked there one summer and had come back complaining about the food (rabbit ears) and the workload. Just because people will pay a lot for your unusual food doesn&#8217;t mean you are advancing things, said Mr. Harvey. Maybe your food doesn&#8217;t taste very good. He pointed to a certain now-forgotten fad among New York dessert chefs a few years ago. That&#8217;s fashion, I said; it has a perfectly good purpose (to support experimentation). Then Mr. Harvey served me his powdered ice cream. Which was more memorable and impressive than anything I had at <a href="http://www.alinea-restaurant.com/">Alinea</a>, an American version of El Bulli.</p>
