				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were many funny things about <a href="http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto.htmlhttp://mag.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto.html" target="_blank">Leah Goodman&#8217;s claim</a> in <em>Newsweek</em> that a California engineer invented bitcoin. One was her observation that he put two spaces after a period &#8212; <em>just like the inventor of bitcoin</em>. Another was her observation that his relatives said he was &#8220;brilliant&#8221;, without giving any examples. His brilliance had remained perfectly hidden &#8211; <em>until now</em>. A third was her conclusion that he was obsessed with secrecy and distrusted government &#8211; <em>just like the inventor of bitcoin</em> (according to her). Felix Salmon <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/03/07/the-satoshi-paradox/" target="_blank">was quite wrong</a> when he said there are some very strange coincidences and the pieces of her argument &#8220;fit elegantly together&#8221;. Actually, her argument is worthless from top to bottom. Salmon was right, however, when he said that the engineer&#8217;s English shows he couldn&#8217;t possibly have invented bitcoin. As Salmon says, Goodman ignored this itty-bitty problem.</p>
<p>Who <em>is</em> the inventor of bitcoin? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo" target="_blank">Nick Szabo</a>, a former law professor at George Washington University. This idea first surfaced a few months ago in <a href="https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-nick-szabo/" target="_blank">an anonymous blog post based on textual analysis</a>. Szabo used certain phrases in the original bitcoin description far more than a bunch of other possible candidates. That is real evidence. The hypothesis that Szabo is the inventor passes several other tests as well:<span id="more-13201"></span></p>
<p>1. Right time zone. The original bitcoin postings appeared to come from the Eastern (United States) time zone. Szabo lives near Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>2. Prior to bitcoin, he had similar ideas. As far as I can tell, his previous ideas were the closest of anyone&#8217;s.</p>
<p>3. Yet the original bitcoin proposal didn&#8217;t reference his work. The usual reason for not mentioning a predecessor&#8217;s work is that you want <em>more</em> credit. Yet the creator of bitcoin <em>didn&#8217;t</em> want credit. Failure to mention Szabo&#8217;s work is so strange it may have been Szabo&#8217;s way of telling insiders he&#8217;s the inventor. In other words, this fact makes sense if Szabo is the inventor. It remains unexplained if anyone else is.</p>
<p>4. Szabo failed to get excited when bitcoin emerged. <em>It was based on his work</em> (more or less).<em> </em>Like everyone, <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2012-The-reception-of-my-self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">including me</a>, Szabo had been <a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html" target="_blank">told countless times</a> that his ideas were worthless, crazy, stupid and so on. (&#8220;Money just doesn&#8217;t work like that, I was told fervently and often.&#8221;) Because of that treatment, I greatly enjoy pointing out confirmation of my ideas. It&#8217;s such a fundamental pleasure there&#8217;s a word for it: <em>glee</em>. If he wasn&#8217;t the inventor of bitcoin, Szabo should have gleefully followed its progress, pointing out over and over how this showed his original ideas were right. He didn&#8217;t do this. Again, this makes sense if he was the inventor &#8212; he didn&#8217;t want to draw attention to how close bitcoin is to his published ideas. It remains unexplained if anyone else is.</p>
<p>5. The clincher, for me, is that he wrote <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html" target="_blank">an article about the emergence of money</a> that is compatible with <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">my theory of human evolution</a>. His article says money emerged from collectibles. Collectibles are an important part of my theory. I say they emerged because they helped skilled artisans, who were innovators, make a living. For most people, collectibles are trivial, whereas I&#8217;ve written often about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/willat-effect/" target="_blank">the Willat Effect</a>, which I believe is the psychological rule that created them. It isn&#8217;t easy to be consistent with my theory. I&#8217;ve read dozens of theories about human evolution. Whenever they explain the same things as mine (e.g., evolution of language), they have been inconsistent with my theory. Two examples are Jared Diamond&#8217;s ideas and Daniel Dennett&#8217;s ideas. Szabo&#8217;s essay is the only the second example I have seen of ideas that fit mine. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis" target="_blank">The aquatic ape theory</a>, which is about what happened before the events of my theory, also fits; Szabo&#8217;s ideas are about what happened after the events of my theory. Szabo&#8217;s ideas about the emergence of money are very non-obvious (especially because you have to realize the centrality of collectibles) and are compatible with a theory he cannot have heard of. I doubt anyone agrees with me that compatibility with my theory is a great plus but it is obvious that if you understand how money began, you are in a much better position to invent a new form of money than if you don&#8217;t. The difficulty of mining bitcoins corresponds to the difficulty of making collectibles. You could randomly pick anyone, including cryptographic experts, and the probability would be <em>extremely</em> low they have a good theory of how money began. Yet Szabo does.</p>
<p>I ignore the coincidence of initials: NS and SN (or NS).</p>
<p>Szabo&#8217;s achievement is good news for me because we have a similarity. He was a law professor. They are not supposed to invent new and useful things. No law professor before Szabo invented anything remotely as new and potentially important as bitcoin. I am a psychology professor. They are not supposed to make useful discoveries about health. I have made discoveries/inventions about health that are certainly new and might some day be important, such as the Shangri-La Diet and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf" target="_blank">the underlying theory</a>, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">the effect of morning faces on mood</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114619130176100669530" target="_blank">daily brain testing</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I posted <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/26/lessons-of-this-blog" target="_blank">Kristen Marcum&#8217;s list of general rules</a> she&#8217;d learned from this blog. (For example, &#8220;be skeptical of experts.&#8221;) Behind her list, I think there is one idea, slightly hidden from view:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>non-experts can discover important things about health</strong></p>
<p>By <em>non-experts</em> I mean people who are not health professionals. People who do not make a living from health research. By <em>discover </em>I mean <em>learn from data for the first time</em>, actually discover &#8212; in contrast to learn from an expert. By <em>important</em> I mean stuff that matters to many people. (It&#8217;s obvious that studying yourself you can help yourself.) I haven&#8217;t heard anyone else say this, although it isn&#8217;t far from the Quantified Self movement. </p>
<p>The first example of this rule was the work of Richard Bernstein, an engineer with diabetes. In the 1960s, he pioneered home blood glucose testing, now enormously important. Another example, I hope, is my work. I used self-tracking and self-experimentation to find <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">important new cause-effect relationships in several areas</a> &#8212; new ways to sleep better or lose weight, for example. I believe my conclusions will turn out be true for many people, not just me, because they fit well with research done with other people and animals. I&#8217;m a professional scientist, which obviously helped, but not a health researcher.<span id="more-12603"></span></p>
<p>Why is this rule true? I found it hard to explain even my discoveries. <a  href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">The first time</a> I tried, I didn&#8217;t do well. I did better <a  href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">the second time</a>.</p>
<p>I came to see that discoveries require several things &#8212; more precisely, rate of discovery is a product of several factors. Everyone sees that experts have several advantages over non-experts:</p>
<ol>
<li>more training (graduate school)</li>
<li>more resources (equipment, grants, space, assistants, journals, specialized libraries, and so on)</li>
<li>more hours per day (all working day)</li>
<li>more experience (their entire working life)</li>
</ol>
<p>What I&#8217;ve never seen pointed out is that non-experts have several advantages over experts:</p>
<ol>
<li>more time overall (with no pressure to publish, a non-expert can easily spend many years on one question)</li>
<li>more freedom (no pressure to follow a party line, obey your boss or be popular)</li>
<li>more motivation (non-experts want to improve their own health, or a loved one&#8217;s health; for health researchers it&#8217;s a job)</li>
<li>ability to self-track and self-experiment (this is too humble for experts)</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of my job, I was only slightly behind health experts in terms of their four advantages, and I was far ahead of them in terms of the four non-expert advantages. This explains why I discovered many things that experts had not managed to discover.</p>
<p>Once I had a reasonable understanding of what had happened, I saw there was no reason I should be the only one. As a professor, I had excellent library access, much better than most, but now, with the Internet, many people have comparable access to research. Supporting my prediction that I am not the only non-expert who can do this, I have found other non-experts who have made important discoveries. Tara Grant figured out that <a href="http://primalgirl.com/2011/11/01/nprimalgirl-sleep-issues-vitamin-d/" target="_blank">the time of day she takes Vitamin D made a big difference</a>. Professional researchers have not yet figured this out. Katie Reid found that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/17/journal-of-personal-science-one-childs-autism-eliminated-by-removal-of-glutamate-from-her-diet/" target="_blank">her autistic daughter completely recovered</a> &#8212; autism symptoms completely gone &#8212; when all glutamate was removed from her diet. Professional autism researchers haven&#8217;t managed to cure even one case of autism, as far as I know. Stuart King figured out that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/11/association-of-sleep-and-chronic-illness/#comment-1150683" target="_blank">a tablespoon of honey at bedtime greatly improved his sleep</a>. No sleep or nutrition researcher has realized this.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, my mother&#8217;s mother sent my mother newspaper clippings about computers, of which, at the time, there were only a few. <em>This is going to be important</em>, she said. Let me continue the tradition by telling you <em>this is going to be important.</em></p>
<p>When even a tiny fraction of non-experts become &#8220;health knowledge generators&#8221; (for lack of a better term) the world will change. Some of the reasons:</p>
<p>1. <strong>The IQ advantage</strong>. There are far more non-experts than health researchers. A factor of 100,000? Let&#8217;s say health researchers have <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/2006/03/iq-in-different-fields.html" target="_blank">an average IQ of 130</a>. If you take 100,000 non-experts (mean IQ = 100, standard deviation = 15) the top IQ among them will be about 165.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Trust and generalizability</strong>. When a health expert advises you to do Treatment X (e.g., surgery), what should you think? Can you (a) trust him and (b) is what he says true for you? Any reader of this blog knows that health experts routinely overstate benefits and understate costs of the treatment they are promoting. Even if they are telling the whole truth, their advice is based, at best, on several studies. Is what those studies found &#8212; studying animals, or at best, other humans &#8212; true for <strong>you</strong>? When you study yourself  &#8211; for example, carefully measuring the effect of a drug &#8212; error due to distortions and differences from the study population go to zero.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Good and bad chemicals</strong>. We encounter thousands of chemicals, many of recent origin. How we react to them &#8212; do they help or hurt? &#8212; is determined by our genome (billions of possibilities) and environmental history (countless possibilities). Any sort of expert testing will be woefully incomplete. The danger in assuming that a chemical safe for most people is safe for you is illustrated by a woman who found her almost constant migraines <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html" target="_blank">were caused by household cleaning products</a> and Katie Reid&#8217;s discovery that her daughter was very sensitive to glutamate (found in a large fraction of supermarket foods). That things claimed to be safe may be dangerous is illustrated by the Berkeley graduate student who became <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/20/teeth-clenching-can-release-mercury/" target="_blank">poisoned by mercury when he started grinding his teeth</a> and my discovery that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">fermented tofu made me stupid</a> for a few days. My experience with tofu and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">butter</a> shows how a non-expert can do better than simply accept what experts say. My brain tracking, which anyone could do, detected previously-unknown or -unclear costs and benefits.</p>
<p>Our economy runs on specialization. We buy cars from car specialists, for example. Long ago, professionals had a monopoly on knowledge. To learn math, you had to pay a math teacher. Then came cheap printing and mass literacy and mathematics books and libraries. The same knowledge became not just free but widely available. Then came the Internet and <em>Wikipedia</em> and Google &#8212; even more available. But all this time, the source of the knowledge, its creation, was restricted to professionals. Only professionals (or rich amateurs, like Darwin) could &#8220;make&#8221; (or &#8220;mine&#8221;) the knowledge. Now that will change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patrick Tucker, an editor at <em>The Futurist</em>,<a href="http://forum.quantifiedself.com/thread-journalist-seeking-stories"> posted a request on the Quantified Self Forums</a> for &#8220;astounding&#8221; predictions based on self-quantification. He is writing a book about using data to make predictions.</p>
<p>Here are examples from my self-measurement:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Drinking sugar water causes weight loss</strong>. The self-quantification was measuring my weight. It began when I found a new way to lose weight, which pushed me to try to explain why it worked. The explanation I came up with &#8212; a new theory of weight control &#8212; made two predictions that via self-experimentation I found to be true. That gave me faith in the theory. Then the theory suggested a really surprising conclusion, that loss of appetite during a trip to Paris was due to the sugar-sweetened soft drinks I had been drinking. If so, drinking sugar water should cause weight loss. (The nearly-universal belief is that sugar causes weight gain, of course.) <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I tested this prediction and it was true</a>. <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/">More</a>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Seeing faces in the morning improves mood the next day (but not the same day)</strong>. This is so surprising I&#8217;ll spell it out: Seeing faces Monday morning improves my mood on Tuesday but not Monday. For years I measured my sleep trying to reduce early awakening. Finally I figured out that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">not eating breakfast helped</a>. There was no breakfast during the Stone Age; this led me to take seriously the idea that other non-Stone-Age aspects of my life were also hurting my sleep. That was one reason I decided to watch to watch a certain TV show one morning. It had no immediate effect. However, the next morning I woke up feeling great. Via self-measurement of mood, I determined it was the faces on TV that produced the effect, confirmed the effect many times, and learned what details of the situation (e.g., face size) controlled the effect. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/morning-faces-therapy-resources/">More</a>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>One-legged standing improves sleep</strong>. Via self-measurement I determined that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">how much I stood during a day controlled how well I slept</a>. If I stood a long time, I slept better. Ten years later I woke one day after having slept much better than usual. The previous day had been unusual in many ways. One of them was so tiny that at first I overlooked it: I had stood on one leg a few times. Just for a few minutes. Yet <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">it turned out that it was the one-legged standing that had improved my sleep</a>. Without the previous work on ordinary standing I would have ignored the one-legged standing &#8212; it seemed trivial.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Butter is healthy</strong>. I found that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/25/butter-and-arithmetic-how-much-butter/">butter improved how fast I can do arithmetic problems</a>. No doubt it improves brain function measured in other ways. Because the optimum nutrition for the brain will be close to the optimum nutrition for the rest of the body &#8212; at least, this is what I believe &#8212; I predict that butter will turn out to be healthy for my whole body, not just my brain.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Mainstream Vitamin D research is all messed up</strong>. Via self-measurement I confirmed Tara Grant&#8217;s conclusion that taking Vitamin D3 in the morning (rather than later) improved her sleep. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/04/28/effect-of-vitamin-d3-on-my-sleep/">It improved my sleep, too</a>. When I had taken it at other times of day I had noticed nothing. Apparently the timing of Vitamin D &#8212; the time of day that you take it &#8212; matters enormously. Take it at the right time in the morning: obvious good effect. Take it late in the evening: obvious bad effect. Vitamin D researchers haven&#8217;t realized this. They have neither controlled when Vitamin D is taken (in experiments) nor measured when it is taken (in surveys). Because timing matters so much it is as if they have done their research failing to control or measure dose. If you fail to control/measure dose, whatever conclusion you reach (good/no effect/bad) depends entirely on what dose your subjects happened to take. And you have no idea what dose that is.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2011/11/23/climategate-2-0-new-e-mails-rock-the-global-warming-debate/2/">The newly-released climate scientist emails</a> (called Climategate 2.0) from University of East Anglia (Phil Jones) and elsewhere (Michael Mann and others) show that <a href="http://climateaudit.org/2011/11/23/private-expressions-of-uncertainty/">top climate scientists agree </a>with me. Like me (see <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/global-warming/">my posts on global warming</a>), they think the evidence that humans have caused dangerous global warming is weaker than claimed. Unfortunately for the rest of us, they kept their doubts to themselves: &#8220;I just refused to give an exclusive interview to SPIEGEL because I will not cause damage for climate science.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a big reason I have found self-experimentation useful. It showed me that experts exaggerate, that they overstate their certainty. At first I was shocked. My first useful self-experimental results were about acne. I found that one of the two drugs my dermatologist had prescribed didn&#8217;t work. He hadn&#8217;t said <em>This might not work</em>. He didn&#8217;t try to find out if it worked. He appeared surprised (and said &#8220;why did you do that?&#8221;) when I told him it didn&#8217;t work. Another useful self-experimental result was <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">breakfast caused me to wake up too early</a>. Breakfast is widely praised by dieticians (&#8220;the most important meal of the day&#8221;). I have never heard a dietician say <em>It could hurt your sleep </em>or even a modest <em>There&#8217;s a lot we don&#8217;t know</em>. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/morning-faces-therapy-resources/">My discoveries about morning faces and mood</a> are utterly different than what psychiatrists and psychotherapists say about depression.</p>
<p>As anyone paying attention has noticed, it isn&#8217;t just climate scientists, doctors, dieticians, psychiatrists, and psychotherapists. <em>How can you tell when an expert is exaggerating? His lips move. </em>There are two types of journalism: 1. Trusts experts. 2. Doesn&#8217;t trust experts. I suggest using colored headlines to make them easy to distinguish: red = trusts experts, green = doesn&#8217;t trust experts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When <em>The Shangri-La Diet </em>was published (2006), I enjoyed checking its Amazon rank. The rank got worse. I checked less often. Eventually it was usually above 100,000 and I barely checked at all.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I noticed it was much better than I expected &#8212; maybe 40,000. <em>How did that happen?</em> Were sales improving? To find out, I subscribed to RankTracer, which records Amazon rank every hour and plots the results.<span id="more-3015"></span></p>
<p>Here are the first two months of data from RankTracer:</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/2011-05-06-raw-amazon-rank-vs-date.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3044" title="2011-05-06 raw amazon rank vs date" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/2011-05-06-raw-amazon-rank-vs-date.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>This resembles the graphs that RankTracer makes. Whether the rank is steadily improving isn&#8217;t clear. Here is the same data with a logarithmic <em>y</em> axis:</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/2011-05-06-log-amazon-rank-vs-date.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3046" title="2011-05-06 log amazon rank vs date" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/2011-05-06-log-amazon-rank-vs-date.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Now steady improvement is obvious.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that slowly increasing sales five years after publication is extremely rare. But a bizarre sales record is entirely consistent with two recent comments on the SLD forums. One is <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8000.msg103536#msg103536">this</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It does work, and it is totally boggling that something so counter-intuitive would work. . . . You don&#8217;t have to devote your life to starving and working out. One of the best-kept secrets of all time.</p>
<p>The other is <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=7736.msg103741#msg103741">this</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I refuse to get drawn into &#8216;how crazy&#8217; it sounds &#8230; I just like the results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For an article about self-experimentation and self-tracking to appear in <em>Men&#8217;s Fitness UK</em> this summer, Mark Bailey sent me several questions.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways have the results of your self-experimentation directly affected your daily life e.g. health / work / lifestyle changes?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Acne</em>. My dermatologist prescribed two medicines. I found that one worked , the other didn&#8217;t.<em> </em></li>
<li><em>Weight</em>. Found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shangri-Diet-Hunger-Anything-Weight-Loss/dp/B0014E92NC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1249187928&amp;sr=8-1">new ways to lose weight</a> (e.g., <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php">nose-clipping</a>).</li>
<li><em>Sleep</em>. Found <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">new ways to sleep more deeply, avoid early awakening</a> (e.g., <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">one-legged standing</a>).</li>
<li><em>Mood, energy, serenity</em>. Found that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">morning faces make me more cheerful, more energetic, and more serene</a>.</li>
<li><em>Productivity</em>. After I started to track when I was working, I  discovered that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=post&amp;category_name=productivity">a certain feedback system </a>made me work more, goof off less.</li>
<li><em>Inflammation</em>. Self-experimentation led me <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">to take flaxseed oil</a>. In the right dose &#8212; which I determined via self-experimentation &#8212; it greatly reduces inflammation. As a result, my gums are pink instead of red. They no longer bleed when I floss.</li>
<li><em>Balance, reflexes</em>. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">Flaxseed oil</a> improved my balance and quickened my reflexes &#8212; I catch what I would have dropped.</li>
<li><em>Blood sugar</em>. I found that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/">walking a lot improves my blood sugar level</a>.</li>
<li><em>Mental clarity</em>. I found that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">flaxseed oil</a> and <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/">butter</a> improve how well my brain works in several ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>Changes 1-6 are/were obvious. The rest are more subtle.</p>
<p><span id="more-2734"></span></p>
<p><strong>How long have you been self-experimenting?</strong></p>
<p>About 35 years.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main advantages of self-experimentation e.g. yields results specifically relevant to the individual and engages them directly in the process of finding solutions?</strong></p>
<p>My self-experimentation has had three benefits:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Find new ways to improve health</strong>. Ways that no one knew about. I mentioned most of them earlier:   New ways to lose weight, sleep better, be in a better mood, and so on. I find them to be much better (safer, cheaper, more powerful) than what was already available.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Test health claims made by others</strong>. I&#8217;ve done this many times. My interesting self-experimentation started when, as I said earlier, I measured the efficacy of two acne medicines my dermatologist had prescribed. I found that Treatment A worked and Treatment B did not worked, which was the opposite of what I had believed. It&#8217;s been claimed that drinking vinegar causes weight loss. I tried that, it didn&#8217;t work. Many people say that exercise improves sleep. I found that aerobic exercise made me fall asleep faster but did not reduce early awakening. The most dramatic &#8220;test&#8221; of health claims made by others came when I discovered that butter improved my arithmetic speed &#8212; which meant it was likely that butter improved overall brain function. I took this to mean that butter was good for the rest of the body &#8212; in contradiction to the official line that saturated fats are bad for us.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Find best &#8220;dose&#8221; of a  treatment</strong>. Many people have claimed that flaxseed oil is beneficial. I found they were right. I tested different amounts/day and found the dosage that produced the most benefit. The best dose (2-3 tablespoons/day) was much larger than you would guess from the size of flaxseed oil capsules and the suggested dose on bottles of flaxseed oil capsules.</p>
<p><strong>What do you consider are the potential weaknesses e.g. lack of clinical precision / possible placebo effect?</strong></p>
<p><em> </em>Is too-high expectations a weakness? You could spend a lot of time and not learn anything useful. Which isn&#8217;t so much a weakness as a fact of life.</p>
<p>In my experience, useful self-tracking and self-experimentation are slow. Other people&#8217;s self-tracking projects often strike me as too ambitious &#8212; doing too much too soon. For example, they are tracking too many things. Or worrying too much about placebo effects.  Because they are doing too much &#8212; carrying too much, you could say &#8212; they may get tired and stop before they have learned something useful.</p>
<p><strong>From a psychological perspective, why is the use of data / numbers, as in self-tracking, so much more powerful and engaging than merely &#8216;setting a goal&#8217;? </strong></p>
<p>For one thing, it&#8217;s more forgiving. When I set goals for myself, I often fail to meet them. That can be so unpleasant I give up. When you simply measure something, it much easier to succeed &#8212; all you have to do is make the measurement. For another thing, it&#8217;s more informative. By studying my data I can learn what controls what I&#8217;m measuring (e.g., sleep). Setting a goal doesn&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p><strong>Why, in a world dominated by numbers / statistics, has it taken so long for us to use data to learn about ourselves, our lives and our bodies?</strong></p>
<p>You seem to be asking <em>why has it taken so long to apply something so useful elsewhere (&#8220;numbers/statistics&#8221;) to ourselves? </em>I have a different starting point. I think it is science &#8212; which is more than numbers and statistics &#8212; that has been useful elsewhere. Numbers/statistics by themselves are little help. I also think health scientists (e.g., med school professors) <strong>have</strong> used numbers/statistics to learn about ourselves &#8212; with little success.</p>
<p>In my experience, <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf">you need four things to make useful progress on health</a>: 1. <strong>Good tools</strong>. Computer, numerical measurement. 2. <strong>Experiments</strong>. You need to systematically change things. 3. <strong>Knowledge of what others have learned</strong>. You can&#8217;t do experiments blindly, there are too many possibilities. You have to choose wisely what to change. 4. <strong>Motivation</strong>. You have to really care about finding something useful.</p>
<p>Professional scientists have Numbers 1-3 (tools, experiments, knowledge). Lacking Number 4 (motivation), they haven&#8217;t gotten very far. Self-trackers have Number 1 (tools). If they have a problem, something they want to improve, they have Number 4 (motivation). Most self-trackers have Numbers 1 and 4. Without Numbers 2 and 3 (experiment and knowledge) they aren&#8217;t going to get very far. What&#8217;s so important about the self-quantification movement is they <strong>might </strong>get Numbers 2 and 3. They might learn to experiment. They might learn to study what everyone else has already learned. When that happens, I think they will make a lot of progress. They will discover useful stuff that professional scientists have missed. And the whole world will benefit.</p>
<p><strong>What developments will need to occur before self-tracking can really grow in the future e.g. better analysis / devices etc?</strong></p>
<p>More successful examples. More examples where self-tracking led to improvement. They will teach everyone how to do it usefully. I think these examples will show that self-tracking alone is not nearly enough, as I said. But maybe I&#8217;m wrong. We need examples to find out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/personal-science/201104/the-shangri-la-diet-why-no-revolution">my Psychology Today blog</a> someone left a surprising comment about why the Shangri-La Diet isn&#8217;t more popular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seth, I&#8217;ll tell you why. Because we are majorly competitive bitches, we women who care about our appearance. I&#8217;m 41, I have three children and I am a size 6. I fit into my wedding dress and the jeans I wore in college. How? Shangri-La. And there is no way in hell I am going to share my secret with anyone.</p>
<p>Went to the movies this weekend with a group of friends. They had the usual movie fare, I ordered a cup of tea (bag on the side), added two tablespoons of sugar (put the teabag in my purse for later), sipped it slowly throughout the movie, had not ONE craving for the popcorn or nachos or M&amp;M&#8217;s everyone else was scarfing. I went home and had a light dinner and felt terrific!</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds more like an ad than an actual comment, but it could hardly be more vivid and I believe it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am looking forward to reading <em>Wrong: Why Experts Keep Failing Us â€” And How to Know When Not to Trust Them</em> by David Freedman because of this sentence in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/books/excerpt-wrong.html?pagewanted=3&#038;_r=1">an excerpt</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cancer experts shake their heads today over the ways in which  generations of predecessors wasted decades hunting down the mythical  environmental or viral roots of most cancers, before pronouncing as a  sure thing the more recent theory [that] cancer is caused by mutations  in a small number of genes â€” a theory that, as weâ€™ll see, has yielded  almost no benefits to patients after two decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s referring to the oncogene theory of cancer, for which Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus won a Nobel Prize in 1989.Â  I made <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/25/should-mark-twain-have-won-a-nobel-prize/">a similar comment at a dinner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several years ago, at a big Thanksgiving dinner in an Oakland loft, I  told the woman sitting next to me, a genetic counselor, what a travesty  the Biology [Nobel] prizes were. The discovery that smoking causes lung cancer  had improved the lives of millions of people, I said [yet the discoverers hadn't gotten a Nobel Prize]; the discovery of  so-called oncogenes hadnâ€™t improved the life of even one person. She  replied that she was the sister of [Harold Varmus]. The  next day I learned she complained I had been rude!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m glad Freedman agrees with me. My low opinion of oncogene theory didn&#8217;t prevent Varmus from becoming head of the National Institutes of Health, whose recent budget was about $30 billion/year.
</p>
<p>Thanks to Kathy Tucker.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This comment was made recently on <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/04/29/eczema-nighttime-cough-antibiotics-and-fermented-food/">an earlier post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am so glad I found this blog.</p>
<p>My daughter has had coughing fits for 24 months (she&#8217;s 5 1/2 yo).</p>
<p>Inhalers, several doctors, nothing helped. She routinely coughed until vomiting. After one 10 hour coughing fit I reached my limit and scoured the web.</p>
<p>After putting in her whole medical history as search qualifiers I found this [post]. The prior eczema and antibiotics were key indicators.</p>
<p>After 3 days of drinking 1 probiotic shake a day, she showed very marked improvement. After 1 week, no symptoms. This is a girl who&#8217;s been unable to run and play for 2 years. Who woke up coughing and gagging most nights.</p>
<p>After 6 weeks of the same regimen, she still shows no symptoms and is running and playing full blast.</p>
<p>The pulmonary specialist discounts the results we&#8217;ve seen as a fluke . . . we&#8217;ll see. Previously my daughter&#8217;s lung capacity was measured at 47% of expected.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Unable to run and play for 2 years&#8221;! I&#8217;m impressed. Not only (a) the improvement is huge, but also (b) it resembles verification of a prediction, not just something a theory can explain, (c) it wasn&#8217;t obvious to &#8220;several doctors&#8221; or (d) the rest of the Internet, and (e) <strong>after it happened</strong> it was dismissed by an expert, even though the evidence for causality is excellent. The verification aspect reminds me of <a href="http://www.tundrasquid.com/canto3.htm"><em>Pale Fire</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If on some nameless island Captain Schmidt<br />
Sees a new animal and captures it,<br />
And if, a little later, Captain Smith<br />
Brings back a skin, that island is no myth.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I remember reading on your blog about <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/10/11/how-to-eliminateprevent-a-skin-infection-and-what-it-means/">more socks as a cure for Athlete&#8217;s Foot </a>and I had a fungal infection on my foot from climbing around barefoot outside, I think. I tried using two different antifungal creams. They didn&#8217;t work. To be honest I didn&#8217;t use them for the recommended time cuz it&#8217;s a huge fucking hassle. You have to put it on your feet, let it dry, rub it in blah blah blah. And it&#8217;s kinda gross to use. So I went to <a href="http://www.uniqlo.cn/">Uniqlo</a> [a Japanese clothing store] and bought like 20 pairs of extra socks and forgot about it. But when I wash socks the washed ones get put in the back of the drawer so the effect is the socks I wear spend like 3-4 days away from my feet every time. Anyway, the infection COMPLETELY disappeared. There is a weird sense of satisfaction from this kind of cure. It feels like just by doing some small things &#8216;right&#8217; all these health issues can be fixed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had foot fungus for years, I too tried antifungal creams without success, and the problem cleared up within days when I bought a lot more socks. It has remained cleared-up. You could call it the <em>staging-area problem</em>: Our things act as staging areas for harmful bugs. Another example is <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/08/17/how-to-avoid-infection-something-i-didnt-know/">getting an eye infection from pillowcases</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Kolbert, the <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer, did not know that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125883405294859215.html">Phil Jones, a climate-change scientist, manuevered to keep hidden information</a> that disagreed with his conclusions. Here is what one of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/globalwarming/6636563/University-of-East-Anglia-emails-the-most-contentious-quotes.html">the damning emails gathered from the University of East Anglia&#8217;s Climate Research Unit</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>From Phil Jones [head of the Climate Research Unit]. To: Michael Mann. Date: May 29, 2008<br />
&#8220;Can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith re AR4? Keith will do likewise.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>To keep them from being exposed via a Freedom of Information law. <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/11/its-news-on-academia-not-climate.html">Robin Hanson</a> and <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/">Tyler Cowen</a> think this is no big deal. I disagree. Yes, I said before this happened that <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/11/11/three-things-elizabeth-kolbert-doesnt-know/">the consensus was likely to appear stronger than it is</a> and that <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/11/13/mistaken-consensus-in-physics/#comment-361276">bloggers were a powerful force toward truth</a> &#8212; both of which this episode merely supports rather than reveals. And, yeah, it&#8217;s just email; the <strong>really </strong>damning info is <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/richardfernandez/2009/10/01/the-man-who-broke-the-bank/#more-6192">the tree-ring data reanalyzed by Stephen McIntyre</a>.</p>
<p>The reason I think this is important is two-fold. First, this is not a smoking gun. Global warming does not equal the honesty of Phil Jones. But it is a powerful piece of evidence that climate skeptics can use to convince anyone that the consensus isn&#8217;t as consensus-y as it appears. Second, it exposes <strong>what Kevin Trenberth (a proponent of man-made global warming) really thinks</strong>. This is something that few knew until now. Here is what he really thinks:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact is that we canâ€™t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we canâ€™t. The CERES data published in the August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming: but the data are surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The data are surely wrong</strong>. Trenberth, being human, is going to put the best possible spin on things, the spin most consistent with what he has said many times . . . and this is what he comes up with. Support for the idea of global warming is entirely based on climate models. No one has created a mini-Earth and done experiments. If the data and models don&#8217;t agree, there is no reason to believe the models. And if you don&#8217;t believe the models you have no reason to believe in global warming. Is Trenberth an ignoramus whose honest assessment of the situation (the models and the data profoundly disagree) should be ignored? Of course not. He doesn&#8217;t draw the obvious conclusion (the models are wrong) but nothing prevents the rest of us from doing so.</p>
<p>Just to be clear: I completely agree with Robin&#8217;s larger point that this sort of thing supports prediction markets. And I think reduced reliance on fossil fuel would be a very good thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In March, Century posted <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=6973.0">this on the SLD forums</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d like to put my dog on SLD by giving him his calories through sugar cubes. Would that work?</p>
<p>The dog will whine constantly when he&#8217;s hungry. He&#8217;s pretty old, and at this point, we don&#8217;t have the heart to put him on a strict diet. The hope is that with SLD, we won&#8217;t have to choose between a happy dog and a healthy dog. If it works, he won&#8217;t whine after he&#8217;s been fed his normal serving.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today he posted this:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s worked incredibly well. It&#8217;s gotten to the point where he won&#8217;t whine at all. If I don&#8217;t remember to feed him, he won&#8217;t eat anything. I haven&#8217;t been able to weigh him, so I don&#8217;t really know how much weight he has lost, but a number of people have commented on how much thinner he looks. I&#8217;ve started to cut back on the sugar.</p>
<p>Any doubt I&#8217;ve had that SLD is for real has been erased. It&#8217;s unreal how well it&#8217;s worked for the dog.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Heidi.</p>
