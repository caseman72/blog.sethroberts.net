				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/02/02/adult-acne-water-and-milk-thistle/#comment-1171633" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had awful adult acne, hideous cystic lumps that left scars. My college pictures are hard to look at. This continued into late twenties. It was [due to] a food allergy [that] took forever to figure out: black tea. Especially Oolong. [Oolong and black tea are usually distinguished. Black tea is "fully-fermented", oolong "semi-fermented". -- Seth] My face would begin to itch within minutes of drinking, and the breakout came the following day. But it took years to notice the connection. . . . Green tea is no problem. Coffee is no problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to my questions, he verified the connection:<span id="more-12997"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>On Tuesday night, I drank two cups of strong black tea.  Itching began within a hour, and mouth sores hit 18 hours later.  Now at 48 hours, very slight acne breakout, but not bad at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of figuring out the problem was realizing that face itching was a bad sign. The black tea &#8211;&gt; itching connection was relatively easy to notice. Another difficulty was the wrong ideas he&#8217;d been taught:</p>
<blockquote><p>To figure out the tea, I first had to unlearn things that turned out to be wrong. Unlearning seems to be much slower than learning.</p>
<p>First, when I was in high school, acne was widely considered to be partly a hygiene problem.  So I spent vast useless effort washing several times a day, while possibly missing signals that the cause was something else. Later, in college, I tried washing my face only with water, and then not at all. This turned out to have no effect on acne.  That was the first clue of wrong learning.</p>
<p>Second, in high school I drank a lot of grapefruit juice. The citric acid was extremely painful on the mouth sores.  I somehow concluded, maybe just emotionally biased by the sharp pain, that grapefruit juice was causing the sores. In college I didn&#8217;t drink grapefruit juice, but there was no effect on mouth sores.</p>
<p>Third, a received wisdom was that acne is hormonal, and there was not much you could do but try to manage it.  So I didn&#8217;t even try to look for an environmental cause, until I was still suffering from acne well into my twenties.</p>
<p>These three wrong conclusions probably cost me years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not to mention the astonishing claim of dermatologists that <a href="http://www.skincarephysicians.com/acnenet/acne_and_diet.html" target="_blank"><strong>acne is not caused by diet</strong></a>. This <a href="http://www.aad.org/dermatology-a-to-z/diseases-and-treatments/a---d/acne/tips" target="_blank">list of what to do about acne</a> from the American Academy of Dermatology says nothing about food. It is plausible that in this situation &#8212; in 2014, after hundreds of years of experience treating the problem and thousands of medical journal articles about it &#8212; the overall effect of doctors is to make things worse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reader writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I suffered from moderate acne as a teen, which continued well into my adult years. In my early forties, I sought help from a dermatologist, hoping that progress had been made since my teenage experience which included tetracycline and sunlamp therapy to induce drying and peeling. I was disappointed to have this doctor recommend basically the same treatment twenty five years later. I declined.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a friend recommended drinking lots of water, and I began doing so, attempting to drink eight glasses a day. This was in December. The acne actually got worse . . . but I received a Brita water filter pitcher for Christmas and began drinking filtered water. Within a week my skin was totally clear, and remained so with minimal exception thereafter, even when my water consumption waned over the years. I was delighted and grateful to have found such a simple and healthy solution, and annoyed that no doctor had even suggested it.</p>
<p>But about 15 years later &#8212; about a year ago &#8212; I began to experience significant breakouts again, this time confined largely to my nose. I assumed that I needed to simply up my water intake again. This time it didn&#8217;t help. Maybe the filter was overdue for a change, I thought (we&#8217;d long since upgraded to a reverse osmosis filter), so I had it changed but still no improvement in my skin.</p>
<p>I began cutting out various foods, eggs, coconut oil, whey protein, things I was eating lots of, thinking maybe I&#8217;d developed a sensitivity. Nothing worked, although I did see immediate improvement when visiting family in the states, which made me wonder if it was the change in the water. So  back home I tried to drink bottled water or club soda exclusively and it seemed to help maybe slightly.</p>
<p>I continued to search for a more complete solution. While perusing several online blogs devoted to acne treatment, I read a comment from a self-described longtime sufferer who claimed to have recently discovered a cure for his acne &#8212; milk thistle and NAC [n-acetyl-cysteine]. I got some milk thistle, took a few capsules a day for maybe three days, and voila, clear skin again. I never had reason to add NAC since the milk thistle worked so well.</p>
<p>I have reduced water consumption to normal levels (meaning I try to drink several glasses daily but don&#8217;t bother to track), take a few milk thistle capsules a week (don&#8217;t track that either), and only start to get breakouts if I happen to miss taking any for about a month, which I did just recently over the holidays. I still don&#8217;t know what causes the acne, and I don&#8217;t know why the milk thistle &#8220;cures&#8221; it, but it works wonderfully for me.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.acneeinstein.com/studies-reveal-almost-irrefutable-evidence-for-the-root-cause-of-acne/" target="_blank">Here</a> is more evidence for the effectiveness of milk thistle for acne.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/24/cheap-good-science/" target="_blank">I posted</a> that my work resembles the work of <a href="http://www.redhongyi.com/" target="_blank">the artist Hong Yi</a>. Her work shows that profitable beautiful art can be made from the cheapest materials; my work shows that non-trivial useful science can be done by anyone. A reader named David <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/24/cheap-good-science/#comment-1107993" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your work and discoveries, just like Hong&#8217;s, are very inspirational. . . . They send a message that every individual has the potential to contribute something to society even with no or limited budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>This hadn&#8217;t occurred to me. It should have. I could have made this point in talks, for example.  Beyond the obvious point, David was saying that the more your personal science could help others, the more likely you would be to do it. The prospect of helping yourself <strong>and</strong> others will surely be stronger motivation than the prospect of helping only yourself.</p>
<p>How can one person&#8217;s personal science help others? This doesn&#8217;t happen automatically, it has to be arranged. My <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/personal-science/journal-of-personal-science/" target="_blank"><em>Journal of Personal Science</em></a> and the <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/personal-science/make-yourself-healthy/" target="_blank">Make Yourself Healthy Meetup group</a> are two ways of facilitating this. What about other ways?</p>
<p>David&#8217;s comment made me think of another way: <strong>Acne Club</strong>, that is, a high school club for people with acne. The purpose of the club is to promote personal science about acne. Members of the club try to find the causes of their acne, partly by self-experimentation. They meet to share results and ideas (e.g., treatments to try, how to measure acne) and encourage each other. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12472346" target="_blank">The discovery of two groups of &#8220;primitive&#8221; people who have no acne</a> suggests that all acne has environmental causes. If a high school group could identify even <strong>one</strong> environmental cause, it would be a huge contribution to human well-being &#8212; especially the well-being of high-school students. I think this is quite possible.</p>
<p>I had acne as a teenager. If you start such a club, I would be happy to help you however I can. For example, I could give advice about measurement and experimental design and could publicize what you learn.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking around for evidence connecting glutathione level and acne (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21896138" target="_blank">it has been proposed</a> that low glutathione causes acne), I found <a href="http://www.acne.org/messageboard/topic/307056-low-glutathione-may-be-a-cause-of-acne/" target="_blank">this at acne.org</a>, from a 20-year-old woman:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a personal choice research and viewing other people&#8217;s experiences with supplements is safer than taking my doctor&#8217;s advice. My doctor insisted I go on the pill, insisted I get on antibiotics [a common prescription for acne], insisted nothing was wrong with me and even did a hormonal test&#8230;said I was &#8220;healthy and normal&#8221; and to leave the office because my hormones were normal as well as everything from the liver onwards. I stared at him and told him he was wrong: 1. hormone tests will lie if I&#8217;m on the pill and 2. I have acne, never had it before in my life and it came about too fast &#8230; If acne is a symptom then something is wrong. I personally don&#8217;t trust doctors because they generalize [too much] and from personal experiences [where] I&#8217;ve been laughed at and dismissed and even told &#8220;leaky gut doesn&#8217;t exist&#8221;. Personal research goes a long way and it&#8217;s so great to have communities like this where everyone can help each other out.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is personal science in the sense of trying to learn from other people&#8217;s data. What&#8217;s interesting is that she says this. Nobody forced her to. She isn&#8217;t try to sell something or look good. Her discovery of the power of &#8220;research and viewing other people&#8217;s experiences&#8221; &#8212; better than trusting a doctor &#8212; (a) interests her and (b) she thinks will interest acne.org readers. Her own experience certainly supports what she says.</p>
<p>Long ago, it was discovered that the Earth is round. Before the discovery, nobody said that. After the discovery, people discussed it for a while (&#8220;Have you heard? The Earth is round.&#8221;), maybe a few hundred years. When knowledge of the Earth&#8217;s roundness became part of everyone&#8217;s belief system, people stopped discussing it. </p>
<p>In other words, this comment suggests that a new truth is coming into being. Her experience is the same as mine with regard to acne: Can&#8217;t trust what a doctor says. My dermatologist prescribed two medicines. Studying myself showed that only one of them worked, a possibility my dermatologist seemed to have never considered.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21054577" target="_blank">A new study</a> has found that persons with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laron_syndrome" target="_blank">Laron Syndrome</a> (a kind of dwarfism) get almost no acne. Persons with this syndrome, because of a mutation, are insensitive to growth hormone. As a result, they produce much less IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor) than normal. When given synthetic IGF, they may develop acne; when the dose is reduced, the acne goes away. The authors say: &#8220;The findings suggest that an interaction between IGF-1 and androgens is necessary for the development of acne.&#8221; This is great progress because people with Laron Syndrome are different from everyone else in just one tiny way (albeit a tiny way with many consequences).</p>
<p>The first important step in understanding the cause of acne was <a " href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12472346?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank">finding two (&#8220;primitive&#8221;) groups of people with no acne</a>. This suggested that acne has an environmental cause. There were thousands of differences between the lifestyle of those people and &#8220;modern&#8221; people, so this was just a start. It was hard to know which differences mattered. The Laron Syndrome finding is consistent with the earlier result (no acne in two groups of &#8220;primitive&#8221; people) because a &#8220;Western diet with [its] high intake of hyperglycemic carbohydrates and insulinotropic dairy over-stimulates IIS&#8221; (insulin-like/insulin signaling).</p>
<p>This view predicts that if you replace hyperglycemic foods with foods lower in glycemic index acne should be reduced. <a href="http://www.medicaljournals.se/acta/content/?doi=10.2340/00015555-1346&amp;html=1" target="_blank">This study</a> did that and, indeed, acne decreased (compared to a control group) after ten weeks. The study ended after ten weeks. The patient who reduced his/her glycemic index the most saw the greatest decrease in acne. <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/86/1/107.full#ref-1" target="_blank">A second study</a> found the same thing: a low-glycemic-index diet reduced acne. It lasted twelve weeks. With longer follow-up, there might have been even more improvement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A reader of this blog named Tony Mach <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/19/doctor-logic-acne-is-caused-by-bacteria/#comment-1041747" target="_blank">explains</a> how he figured out that his acne was caused by pasteurized dairy products:</em></p>
<p>In summer 2010 my health problems got noticeably worse (unrefreshing sleep, strange pains, strange sensations in the skin and other stuff I don’t want to share here <img src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" /> ), and I had to do something. Furthermore I was gaining weight,  so I was suspecting something along the lines of diabetes or other metabolic problem.</p>
<p>As I was looking into dietary changes, I stumbled over Wolfgang Lutz’s and Robert Atkins’ work. Being an engineer by training, I figured that if blood sugar might be the problem (which, as it turned out, wasn’t the case for me), then reducing carbs might be a solution (stop fueling the problematic sub-system) – so both Lutz and Atkins appealed to me. I thought let’s give it a try. I was a bit frightened about such an radical change of diet – you read all kind of BS – but hey, I felt like I was going to die anyway.<span id="more-7984"></span></p>
<p>Before the change, I ate a lots of white bread, some milk chocolate and drank lots of milk. First I reduced carbs – like Lutz suggested, I tried to aim for 6 bread units – but within days I noticed that some problems (like the strange pain and skin sensations) diminished right away. The acne cleared up noticeably. So I thought why bother with low-carb, let’s go full no-carb (like Atkins suggests for some month).</p>
<p>And voila, with no-carb everything got better. I started to feel healthy for the first time in my life. I lost over 30 pounds, all health problems either went away or were almost gone, and life started to become enjoyable. This was a period of about two months over with most problems went away, some fast, some slower.</p>
<p>So for over half a year I was focused on the carbs=evil scheme, started eating cheese again (hey, no carbs!), when slowly some of the health problems returned and my weight started to rise again.</p>
<p>At that point I panicked a bit and made a huge mistake: I thought I can figure this one out too, I have to do something right away. So I trusted what some doctors had written about a pathogen (which I tested for with borderline results), how to cure it (with over the counter medications like Vitamin D and NAC and other stuff) and I thought let’s try this too! The things I took made me worse, but as it was supposed to be a “die off”/”herx” reaction, I wasn’t too alarmed. Turned out that experiment cost me almost an year until I got better again. So for about a year I was not in the mood for big experiments and personal stuff like moving to another city kept me busy.</p>
<p>But slowly I introduced “safe starches” into my diet (like plantains), because I kept reading one should not go too much low-carb. I tried out self-made sourdough rye bread (makes me enormously hungry, so I stopped again) and at one point I thought: What the heck, I’m going to eat ice cream today. Three hours later I got slightly noticeable pimples and local inflammation (I think they are called nodules) and after another roughly 3 hours the acne was prominent.</p>
<p>After that, my suspicion was that milk might be bad for me, but maybe some properly “ripe” cheese like hard cheese (properly digested by bacteria) might be OK. So I waited for the acne inflammation to go away and tried again with a Parmesan cheese. Bingo, acne again, and again in the 3 to 6 hour time frame.</p>
<p>So I didn’t touch milk or dairy again, but now I looked for raw milk cheese, as I read something about it being possibly better. After a while I found raw-milk-cheese, tried it – and got no acne. Tried again, after some time, with another brand – again no acne. Tried cheese from pasteurized milk – acne.</p>
<p>As I still have health problems, I am still in the process of figuring out things. Next up for me is trying to get rid of beef for a week or two, to see if that might be a problem for me.</p>
<p>In summary:<br />
- I was not very systematic in my experiments, and had some lucky moments.<br />
- All the macro-nutrient ratio paradigms are IMHO BS and not applicable for the majority (might make sense if someone has real/major metabolic problems like T1DM, etc.)<br />
- Having said that, in my view some carb foods come with baggage: e.g. cereal grains and (pasteurized) milk<br />
- A quickly reacting, non-dangerous, clearly visible (objective) surrogate health marker (in my case acne) is worth its weight in gold [<em>I agree, canary in coal mine. In this case it isn't clear what else besides no acne was gained by avoiding pasteurized dairy. -- Seth</em>]<br />
- With such a marker, one should completely eliminate suspicious foods (in my case *ALL* dairy) and then introduce it again (two or three challenges)<br />
- For me, pasteurized dairy = acne, raw dairy = no acne<br />
- Milk chocolate is dairy [<em>A friend's mother said, "If I'm ever in jail, bring me some chocolate." She'll break out.-- Seth</em>]<br />
- Some surrogate health markers (e.g. weight) reacted “funky” for me: I changed my diet to no-carb, my weight went down, and without any big changes [in diet or exercise] my weight started to climb again. [<em>Same thing happened to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">Alex Chernavsky</a>. -- Seth</em>]<br />
- For most of the health problems that went away, I don’t know exactly what food (Cereal grains? Dairy? Vegetable oils? etc.) caused what problem<br />
- As I felt like I was going to die on my old diet, I am not particular keen on going back full scale to my old diet to see if after one or two month all my old symptoms return, to determine which food caused which symptom… [<em>Better to test the old foods one at a time. -- Seth</em>]<br />
- Medical science and several MDs helped me diddly squat<br />
- Paleo blogs were much more helpful than the medical community</p>
<p><em>I can only guess why raw milk and cheese are less harmful than pasteurized milk and cheese. Maybe milk and cheese contain acne-causing chemicals that leak into the blood. Maybe raw milk, which contains bigger entities than pasteurized milk, does a better job of plugging the holes from digestive system to blood.</em></p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Presumably Dr. Jenny Kim is a good dermatologist because the author of <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/10/15/162821580/doctors-strike-mutating-bacteria-in-teen-acne-battle" target="_blank">this NPR piece</a> chose to quote her:</p>
<blockquote><p>UCLA dermatologist Dr. <a href="http://www.uclahealth.org/body.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&amp;id=479&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=15746">Jenny Kim</a> says many people don&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s bacteria that cause acne. &#8220;Some people say your face is dirty, you need to clean it more, scrub more, don&#8217;t eat chocolate, things like that. But really, it&#8217;s caused by bacteria and the oil inside the pore allows the bacteria to overpopulate,&#8221; Kim says.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I were to ask Dr. Kim how she knows that acne is &#8220;caused by bacteria&#8221; I think she&#8217;d say &#8220;because when you kill the bacteria [with antibiotics] the acne goes away.&#8221;  Suppose I then asked: &#8220;Is there evidence that the bacteria of people who get acne differ from the bacteria of people who don&#8217;t get acne (before the acne)?&#8221; What I assume Dr. Kim would answer: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no such evidence, I&#8217;m sure. It is quite plausible that the bacteria of the two groups (with and without acne) are exactly the same, at least before acne. If it turned out, upon investigation, that the bacteria of people who get acne is the same as the bacteria of people who don&#8217;t get acne, that would make it much harder to say that acne is caused by bacteria. As far as I can tell, Dr. Kim and apparently all influential dermatologists have not thought even this deeply about it. To do so would be seriously inconvenient, because if acne isn&#8217;t caused by bacteria, it would be harder to justify prescribing antibiotics. Which dermatologists have been doing  for decades.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t just dermatologists. Many doctors believe that <em>H. pylori</em> causes ulcers &#8212; wasn&#8217;t a Nobel Prize given for discovering that? The evidence for that assertion consisted of: 1. <em>H. pylori </em>found at ulcers. 2. Doctor swallowed billions of <em>H. pylori </em> and <strong>didn&#8221;t get an ulcer</strong>. (Not a typo.) It was enough that he got indigestion or something. 3. Antibiotics cause ulcers to heal. That was enough for the two doctors who made the <em>H. pylori</em> case and the Nobel Prize committee they convinced. The doctors and the committee failed to know or understand that <em>H. pylori</em> infection is very common and almost no one who is infected gets an ulcer. Psychiatric causal reasoning has been even simpler and even more self-serving. We know that depression &#8212; a huge problem &#8212; is due to &#8220;a chemical imbalance&#8221;, according to many psychiatrists, because (a) antidepressants work (not very well) and (b) antidepressants change brain chemistry.</p>
<p>Dr. Kim&#8217;s false certainty matters because I&#8217;m sure most people with acne don&#8217;t know what causes it. I didn&#8217;t. Dr. Kim&#8217;s false certainty and similar statements from other dermatologists make it harder for them to find out.  I wrote about <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html" target="_blank">a woman who figured out what caused her acne</a>. It wasn&#8217;t easy or obvious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone named Red Fury made an interesting comment on <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html#disqus_thread">my Boing Boing article about acne</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had acne on/off for years. . . . In my mid-thirties, I tried the Retin-A at night, antibiotic gel for day regimen for about 2 years &#8211; no effect. . . . Then, I was talking to a co-worker whose daughter was taking &#8216;modeling classes&#8217; to become a teen model. She casually mentioned her acned daughter had to give up rice, potato chips, and bread, all of which are high-glycemic index foods. My quack-radar went off, and I looked around for something scientific behind that advice. <a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/86/1/107.full" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajcn.org/content/86&#8230;</a></p>
<p>Huh. I guess those  nutrition-bashing dermatologists actually did a study and published the scientific results in a peer-reviewed journal. . . . My acne disappeared completely as soon as I eliminated rice and potatoes.</p></blockquote>
<p>He finds a study that supports the casual advice, he follows the advice, his acne disappears. By convincing him to follow the advice, the scientific study helped him get rid of his acne. Which is impressive.</p>
<p>The interesting twist is that <a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/88/1/251.short">the study was published twice</a>, clearly breaking the rules. Bad scientists! Who did something really good.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several months ago I posted about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/12/29/acne-cured-by-self-experimentation/">how Martha Rotter figured out</a> that her acne was caused by cow dairy products. Now <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html#more-175757">a longer version</a> of her story (by me) is on Boing Boing. There is a ton of useful information in the comments. Some examples:</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html#comment-614848450">Dairy is what caused my acne</a>.&#8221; Someone <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html#comment-614953472">replied</a>: &#8220;Same here, specifically milk. I switched to soy milk in high school and my moderately-bad acne went away very suddenly. . . . If I eat a lot of cheese at once, like having pizza more than a couple days a week, my backne gets worse and I get acne inside my ears.&#8221;<span id="more-7343"></span><a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html#comment-614851182">Someone else</a> misunderstands genetics: &#8220;I do have tumor-forming disease (fortunately stable, and partially corrected with surgery) so I do have some sympathy when it comes to this sort of thing, but my condition is so well established as genetic I never even saw hope in trying to control it with diet.&#8221; <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/05/my-porphyria-went-away/">Aaron Blaisdell</a> had a well-established genetic condition (porphyria) that went away when he changed his diet.</p>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html#comment-614870214">Someone else</a> found that dairy mattered:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had terrible acne as a teenager and I drank almost a carton of milk every day. . . .  When I moved  out on my own, I no longer had milk delivered at the door and I fell out of the habit of drinking it altogether, switching to tea and water instead. My face cleared within weeks. . . . Whenever I indulged in cheese, the break-outs returned.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html#comment-614884952">Someone else</a> discovered multiple causes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have had strikingly similar experiences with a very particular form of acne, for years. Multiple doctors with no results until I got frustrated with it. I heard that the four most common causes of skin reactions can be wheat, milk, peanut butter and eggs &#8211; so I took all of them out *and* meat.</p>
<p>And watched my skin slowly return to normal.</p>
<p>After playing with my food by putting one thing in, seeing what happened, and then taking that out and trying something else, I found that wheat in particular is the trigger for me with dairy as a close second.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html#comment-615206244">Someone else</a>: &#8220;I took wheat from my diet, and my skin cleared up. If I allow wheat back in for one day, the next day I have acne.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html#comment-614907909">Not all solutions were dietary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My wife and I found the only thing that worked reliably&#8211;even including a couple of different kinds of antibiotics&#8211;was &#8220;the regimen&#8221; as described on acne.org. Basically you use a low-strength (2.5%) benzoyl peroxide every day and moisturise like mad afterwards.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are just examples. There are many more helpful comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A blog called <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/">Adventures in Nutritional Therapy</a> (started March 2011) is about what the author learned while trying to solve her health problems via nutrition and a few other things. She usually assumed her health problems were due to too much or too little of some nutrient. She puts it like this: &#8220;using mostly non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) supplements and treatments to address depression, brain fog, insomnia, migraines, hypothyroidism, restless legs, carpal tunnel syndrome, and a bunch of other annoyances.&#8221; In contrast to what &#8220;the American medical establishment&#8221; advises. Mostly it is nutritional self-experimentation about a wide range of health problems.</p>
<p>Interesting things I learned from the archives:</p>
<p>1. Question: Did Lance Armstrong take performance-enhancing drugs? I learned that LiveStrong (Armstrong&#8217;s site) is a content farm. Now answer that question again.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;If you return repeatedly to a conventional doctor with a problem they can’t solve, they will eventually suggest you need antidepressants.&#8221;</p>
<p>3.  &#8220;When I mentioned [to Dr. CFS] the mild success I’d had with zinc, he said it was in my mind: I wanted it to work and it did. When I pointed out that 70% of the things I tried didn’t work, he changed the subject. Dr. CFS’ lack of basic reasoning skills did nothing to rebuild my confidence in the health care system.&#8221; Quite right. I have had the same experience. Most things I tried failed. When something finally worked, it could hardly be a placebo effect. This line of reasoning has been difficult for some supposedly smart people to grasp.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/04/the-story-of-the-end-of-my-depression/">A list of things that helped her with depression</a>. &#8220;Quit gluten&#8221; is number one.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">Pepsi caused her to get acne</a>. Same here.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">100 mg/day of iron caused terrible acne</a> that persisted for weeks after she stopped taking the iron.</p>
<p>7. &#8220;<a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/08/abdominal-pain/">In September 2008</a> I started a journey that serves as a good example of the limits of the American health care system, where you can go through three months, 15 doctor visits, $7,000 in medical tests, three prescriptions and five over-the-counter medications trying to treat your abdominal pain, and after you lose ten pounds due to said pain, you are asked by the “specialists” if you have an eating disorder.&#8221; I agree. Also an example of the inability of people within the American health care system to see those limits.  If they recognized that people outside their belief system might have something valuable to contribute, apparently something awful would happen.</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/07/six-weeks-of-sciatica/">Acupuncture relieved her sciatica</a>, but not for long. &#8220;By the time I left [the acupuncturist's office] the pain was gone, but it crept back during my 30-minute drive home.&#8221;</p>
<p>9. Pointing out many wrongs does not equal a right. She praises <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/09/sugar-bitter-pill-video/">a talk by Robert Lustig</a> about evil fructose. I am quite sure that fructose (by itself) did not cause the obesity epidemic. For one thing, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I lost a lot of weight by drinking it</a>. (<a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">Here is an advanced discussion</a>.) In other words, being a good critic of other people&#8217;s work (as Lustig may be) doesn&#8217;t get you very far. I think it is hard for non-scientists (and even some scientists) to understand that all scientific work has dozens of &#8220;flaws&#8221;. Pointing out the flaws in this or that is little help, unless those flaws haven&#8217;t been noticed. What usually helps isn&#8217;t seeing flaws, it is seeing what can be learned.</p>
<p>10. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/06/headaches-and-migraines/">A list of what caused headaches and migraines</a>. One was MSG. Another was Vitamin D3, because it made her Vitamin B1 level too low.</p>
<p>She is a good writer. Mostly I found support for my beliefs: 1. Of the two aspects of self-experimentation (measure, change),  change is more powerful. She does little or no self-tracking  (= keeping records) as far as I could tell, yet has made a lot of progress. She has done a huge amount of trying different things. 2. Nutritional deficiencies cause a lot of problems. 3. Fermented food is overlooked. She never tries it, in spite of major digestive problems. She does try probiotics. 4. American health care is exceedingly messed-up. As she puts it, &#8220;the American medical establishment has no interest in this approach [which often helped her] and, when they do deign to discuss it, don&#8217;t know what the #%@! they&#8217;re talking about.&#8221; 5. &#8220;Over the years I&#8217;ve found accounts of personal experiences to be very helpful.&#8221; I agree. Her blog and mine are full of them.</p>
<p>Thanks to Alexandra Carmichael.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/12/self-experimenters-scientific-american/">Her latest post</a> mentions me (&#8220;The fella after my own heart is Seth Roberts, who after ten years of experimenting . . . &#8220;). I was unaware of that when I wrote the above.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In November, at Quantified Self Europe, Martha Rotter, who lives in Ireland, gave a talk about how she cured her acne by self-experimentation. She <a href="http://martharotter.com/blog/index.php/2011/11/quantified-self-europe-review/">summarizes her talk</a> like this (slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/martharotter/curing-your-skin-with-food">here</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>When I moved to Ire­land [from Seattle] in 2007, I began to have skin prob­lems. It began gradu­ally and I attrib­uted it to the move, to stress, to late nights drink­ing with developers and cli­ents, to travel, to whatever excuses I could think of. The stress was mul­ti­plied by the anxi­ety of being embar­rassed about how my face looked, but also because my new job in Ire­land involved me being on stage in front of large audi­ences con­stantly, often sev­eral times a week. A year later my skin was per­petu­ally inflamed, red, full of sores and very pain­ful. When one spot would go away, two more would spring up in its place. It was a tough time. I cried a lot.</p>
<p>Frus­trated, I went to see my homet­own der­ma­to­lo­gist while I was home for hol­i­days. He told me that a) this was com­pletely nor­mal and b) there was noth­ing I could do but go on anti­bi­ot­ics for a year (in addi­tion to spend­ing a for­tune on creams and pills). I didn’t believe either of those things.</p>
<p>I was not inter­ested in being on an anti­bi­otic for a year, nor was I inter­ested in Accu­tane (my best friend has had it mul­tiple times and it hasn’t had long term res­ults, plus it can be risky). What I was inter­ested in was fig­ur­ing out why this was hap­pen­ing and chan­ging my life to make it stop. I refused to accept my dermatologist’s insist­ence that what you put in your body has no effect on how you look and feel.</p>
<p>I began sys­tem­at­ic­ally cut­ting things out of my diet to see how I reacted. First chicken and soy, based on a recom­mend­a­tion from a food aller­gist. Over the course of a year I cut out sugar, glu­ten, carbs, starches, caf­feine, meat, fish until finally the magical month of Decem­ber 2010 when I cut out dairy. My skin was my own again by New Year’s day this year.</p>
<p>It took a year to fig­ure it out. It was com­pletely worth it. There’s noth­ing wrong with Irish dairy, it just doesn’t work for me. I drink Amer­icanos instead of lattes now, I don’t eat cer­eal; none of that is a huge deal. For what it’s worth, I can drink goat’s milk.</p></blockquote>
<p>A great example of the power of self-experimentation compared to trusting doctors. One quibble: I&#8217;ll be more sure &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing wrong with Irish dairy&#8221; if she finds that American dairy also causes skin problems. The evidence so far (she didn&#8217;t have skin problems until she moved to Ireland) suggests that at least for her American dairy (i.e., dairy where she lived in America) is better than Irish dairy. I have heard Irish dairy praised. They sell Irish butter at Beijing stores near me. I won&#8217;t be buying it.</p>
<p>At the end of her post she makes a very important point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Quan­ti­fied Self isn’t for every­one, but <em>every­one</em> should feel they have the power to change things in their body and their life for the better.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. By learning about examples of people who have done just that &#8212; such as Martha &#8212; we will come closer to having that power. Right now, as far as I can tell, most people feel helpless. They do what doctors or other experts tell them to do, even if it doesn&#8217;t work very well.</p>
<p>Long ago, hardly anyone could read. This left them in the grip of those who could. But eventually came mass literacy, when the benefits of reading finally exceeded the costs (e.g., because more books were available at lower prices). Reading is primitive science: if you read about things that happened, it is information gathering. It resembles doing a survey. Nowadays, almost everyone (in rich countries) reads, but almost no one does experimental science. This leaves them in the grip of those who can do experimental science (e.g., drug companies). I think my work and Martha&#8217;s work suggest we are close to another turning point, where, for nonscientists, the benefits of doing experiments exceed the costs.</p>
<p>Thanks to Gary Wolf.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/08/29/alexandra-carmichael-almost-eliminates-headaches/">Yesterday I wrote</a> how <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/08/my-n1-quest-to-live-headache-free/">Alexandra Carmichael&#8217;s headache story</a> illustrated a large and awful truth about modern healthcare: It happily provides expensive relief of symptoms while ignoring investigation of underlying causes. If we understood underlying causes (e.g., causes of migraines), prevention would be easy. <em>Let people get sick so that we can make money from them.</em> There should be a name for this scam. In law enforcement, it&#8217;s called entrapment.</p>
<p>Sensible prevention research would start small. Not by trying to prevent breast cancer, or heart disease, or something like that: They take many years to develop and therefore are hard to study. Sensible prevention research would focus on things that are easy to measure and happen soon after their causative agents. One example is migraines. Migraines happen hours after exposure. The fact that Chemical X causes migraines means it is likely that Chemical X is bad for us, even if it doesn&#8217;t cause migraines in everyone. This is the canary-in-a-coal-mine idea. Migraines are the canary.</p>
<p>Acne is another canary. Acne is easy to measure. Figuring out how to prevent it would be a good way to begin prevention research. To prevent acne would be to take the first steps toward preventing many more diseases. A <strong>high-school student</strong> could do ground-breaking research &#8212; research that would improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people &#8212; about how to prevent acne but somehow this never happens. In spite of this possibility, grand-prize-winning high-school science projects, from the most brilliant students in the whole country, are always about trivia.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960321-8/abstract">A just-published review</a> in <em>The Lancet</em> reveals once again the unfortunate perspective of medical school professors. The abstract ends with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>New research is needed into the therapeutic comparative effectiveness and safety of the many products available, and to better understand the natural history, subtypes, and triggers of acne.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, finding out what causes acne is all that&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>To figure out what causes acne (and thereby how to prevent it) three things are necessary: (a) study of environmental causes, such as diet, (b) starting with n=1, and (c) willingness to test many ideas that might be wrong (because it&#8217;s far from obvious how to prevent acne). All three of these things are exactly what the current healthcare research system opposes. It opposes prevention research because drug companies don&#8217;t fund it. It opposes n=1 studies because they are small and cheap, which is low-status. To do such a study would be like driving a Corolla. It opposes studies that could take indefinitely long because such studies are bad for a researcher&#8217;s career. Researchers need a steady stream of publications.</p>
<p>High school students, who aren&#8217;t worried about status or number of publications, could make a real contribution here. You don&#8217;t need fancy equipment to measure acne.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Treatment of acne with isotretinoin is associated with suicide attempts, according to <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c5812.full.pdf+html">a new study</a>. A puzzle is that suicide attempts started to rise before the treatment started. They sharply declined to baseline after treatment stopped.</p>
<p>Acne is an good target for self-experimentation because it is easy to measure and <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/06/24/acne-self-experimentation-why-its-promising/">is surely related to diet</a>. My discovery of the value of self-experimentation happened with acne: I discovered that of the two drugs my dermatologist had prescribed, one (benzoyl peroxide) worked, the other (tetracycline) didn&#8217;t. I had believed the opposite, that tetracycline worked and benzoyl peroxide didn&#8217;t work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese government sets limits to the number of acceptable student suicides per year at every college. If the number is exceeded, the college is punished &#8212; perhaps by a reduction in administrator salaries. Although colleges conceal suicides from their own students, they dare not conceal them from the government. At Tsinghua (with about 12,000 students) the annual limit is six. (So far this year, there have apparently been none.) In the electrical engineering department recently, more than six students were thought to be considering suicide. Because of this, a psychology professor gave the EE majors a talk about looking at the bright side of things.</p>
<p>A newly-formed Tsinghua student club has a Chinese name that means Sing Your Heart. It is for students who want to volunteer to teach in poor rural areas.Â  The club has a special song that they sing at every meeting. They are remarkably ambitious: They want to set up a training program to train students to teach in these areas.</p>
<p>The School of Humanities and Social Sciences has a debate competition every year. This year&#8217;s topic is: <em>Should <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuwa">the Fuwa</a> (the Beijing Olympic mascots) have genders?</em></p>

Only two treatments rate high for effectiveness and both have only a few raters. Neither of the high-rated treatments (Roaccutane andÂ Dr. Hauschka Skin Care) was part of Stone-Age life. Because of <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/06/24/acne-self-experimentation-why-its-promising/">the absence of acne in at least a few groups of people</a> living more Stone-Age-like (<em>stoneagesque</em>?) lives, it is likely that something about modern life causes acne. When whatever that is is figured out, it should be possible to eliminate acne cheaply and safely.</p>
<p>Regardless of the future, this table  is a big step forward in dealing with the problem. It is the first unbiassed look at the effectiveness of different treatments I have seen and it tests a lot of everyday treatments (e.g., face-washing). Academic papers on the subject usually study prescription drugs and the authors usually favor one of the treatments being studied.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acne.com, a website paid for by the drug company behind Proactiv, a common acne medicine, <a href="http://www.acne.com/myths_claims/myths_claims.php">has the following</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Acne Myths &#038; Claims: Certain foods cause acne.</strong> No, those french fries you had yesterday didnâ€™t give you new zits today. In fact, scientists have been unable to find ANY substantial connection between diet and acne. So all the foods youâ€™ve been afraid of â€” pizza, french fries, chocolate â€” are fine. Of course, that doesnâ€™t mean you should binge on your favorites whenever you want â€” a healthy diet will help your body have the strength to help you in your fight against acne. So use your common sense, but donâ€™t be afraid to indulge now and then.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;All the foods you&#8217;ve been afraid of are fine&#8221;? This is much too certain-sounding. T<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/12/20/diet-and-acne/">he studies that failed to find a diet/acne connection were poor</a>. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/06/24/acne-self-experimentation-why-its-promising/">Other research suggests that acne may well have a dietary cause.</a> The false certainty is self-serving. <em>Because foods don&#8217;t cause acne don&#8217;t bother trying to figure out which ones; just take our medicine!</em> It resembles <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/09/13/the-case-of-the-missing-evidence/">my surgeon claiming there was evidence that the surgery she recommended and would profit from was a good idea</a> when there wasn&#8217;t any such evidence.</p>
<p>In contrast, acne.org <a href="http://www.acne.org/myths.html">has this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Myth: Diet and acne are related</strong>. Reality: The bottom line is we need more research. We do know that people in some indigenous societies do not experience [any] acne whatsoever across the entire population. This is in stark contrast to the widespread presence of acne throughout all modern society. It leaves us to ponder the question of whether the indigenous people&#8217;s diet contributes to their acne-free skin. Discovering a dietary way of preventing acne may be a future reality, however, we may live so differently from our hunter/gatherer ancestors that it has become close to impossible to replicate our ancestral diet. But let&#8217;s see if we can work together to come to some consensus from our own experiences. If you feel that you have cleared your acne using a particular diet, or if you are planning on attempting a diet of some kind, please post your method on the Nutrition &#038; Holistic health message board.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s reasonable and helpful. The  website that <strong>couldn&#8217;t</strong> hire expensive experts  had better information.</p>
