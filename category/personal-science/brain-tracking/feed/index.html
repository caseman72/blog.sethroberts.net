				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-25-bad-restaurant-maybe.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13110" alt="2014-02-25 bad restaurant maybe" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-25-bad-restaurant-maybe-591x300.jpeg" width="591" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This graph shows recent results from the test I used to track my brain function. The test is a choice reaction task done on my laptop: see a digit (e.g.,&#8221;2&#8243;), press the corresponding key as fast as possible. The <em>x</em> axis shows the time of the test. The ticks (&#8220;Sat&#8221;, etc.) mark the beginning of the associated days. The <em>y</em> axis shows the average percentile of the reaction times. Higher percentile = faster. (Let me explain what &#8220;percentile&#8221; means: Each reaction time is compared to earlier reaction times with the same stimulus, and its percentile is computed. For example, a percentile of 60 means that 60% of previous responses were slower.) An average of 60 is quite good and 40 is quite bad. I usually do two tests per day, one right after the other, in the late afternoon (e.g., 4:30 pm).<span id="more-13109"></span></p>
<p>On Friday and Saturday, my scores were close to normal. On Sunday afternoon, however, my scores were much worse than usual; the average score was about 15. A score that low might happen once per year. The next day (Monday) I tested more often than usual &#8212; both morning and afternoon &#8212; and my scores gradually returned to normal. On Tuesday I also tested both morning and afternoon. My scores were ordinary the whole time. This showed that the improvement Monday morning was not normal.</p>
<p>What happened Sunday? I am pretty sure the problem is my lunch at a middle-cost noodle restaurant whose English name is <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294212-d5482531-Reviews-Flying_Noodle-Beijing.html" target="_blank">Flying Noodle</a>. It is close to the Tsinghua campus but I&#8217;d only been there once before (and eaten almost nothing that time). On Sunday I had a small pickled vegetable dish and an ordinary-sized plate of fried eggs and tomatoes. I suspect the problem is the oil used to cook the egg and tomato. It might have been soybean, corn, sunflower or peanut oil, all high in omega-6. (There are also complaints about reuse of cooking oil.) As I entered the restaurant, I worried about the oil, but also thought <i>who really knows? </i>By the time of my brain test, I had forgotten my concern.</p>
<p>A friend was with me. She ate different dishes. She found that her scores on a iPhone game she often plays, which requires fast reactions, were suddenly and mysteriously worse after the lunch. Then, in about a day, they recovered.</p>
<p>This interests me in several ways:</p>
<p>1. <strong>New phenomenology</strong>. In this example and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">my earlier tofu results</a> (a piece of fermented tofu reduced my brain score for two days), I noticed something never noticed before: Sharp changes (bad) in brain function. Fortunately I quickly recovered. Nobody knew this happened. It&#8217;s like looking through a microscope or telescope for the first time, but with much more relevance to everyday concerns. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Comparison with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me" target="_blank"><i>Super Size Me</i></a></strong>, a 2004 documentary by Morgan Spurlock, which argued that McDonald&#8217;s food was unhealthy. Spurlock ate only McDonald&#8217;s food for 30 days. Realism: Spurlock ate far more McDonald&#8217;s food than anyone would normally eat; I ate one meal. Information value: Spurlock&#8217;s test was so unrealistic and his diet so plainly unhealthy that I doubt the results &#8212; Spurlock&#8217;s health got worse, he gained weight &#8212; have any implications for the rest of us. In contrast, I find my results horrifying. Bias: Spurlock was obviously biased against McDonald&#8217;s before he started. I thought favorably of the Flying Noodle &#8212; that&#8217;s why I went there. Cost: My data cost essentially nothing, Spurlock&#8217;s movie <a href="http://www.filmeducation.org/pdf/film/SuperSizeMe.pdf" target="_blank">cost $65,000</a>, not to mention the damage to Spurlock&#8217;s health. Recovery time: Spurlock took 14 months to lose the weight he gained. I recovered in a day. Repeatability: My test is easy to repeat, Spurlock&#8217;s very difficult.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Public health disaster?</strong> China has a very high rate of diabetes, for unknown reasons. Chinese teenagers and college students have much worse (inflamed) skin than I see in other countries. Old people in China look much worse than old people in Japan. Could heavy use of high-omega-6 cooking oil be a big reason? </p>
<p>4. <strong>Where were authorities?</strong> We expect our government &#8212; in combination with academia &#8212; to protect us against dangerous chemicals in our environment. If I&#8217;m right about the cause of my low score, that didn&#8217;t happen here. Cooking oil is the opposite of a rare food. If ordinary amounts of a common cooking oil did cause these results, it suggests something is seriously wrong with the regulatory system. A big argument for personal science &#8212; and brain tracking in particular &#8212; is that you monitor exactly the environment to which you are exposed in exactly the genetic context you care about (yours).</p>

Each point is a different test; I usually do two tests per day back to back. I assume faster = better. In February 2013 I returned to Berkeley from Beijing. In August 2013 I went back to Beijing. When I returned to Berkeley, my scores got worse (slower). I was shocked. <em>Surely Berkeley is healthier than Beijing</em>. At first I thought it was jet lag, but the scores stayed worse long after that made sense. Then I thought it might be some difference in diet, even though I eat similar food in the two places. I tried to make my Berkeley diet closer to my Beijing diet. This might have helped. I noticed accidentally that chocolate improved my score and started eating chocolate frequently. This artificially reduced the difference since in Beijing I had not been eating chocolate. In Berkeley I started doing two things I hadn&#8217;t done in Beijing: alternate-day fasting and whole-body vibration. I don&#8217;t know if they made a difference. When I returned to Beijing in September, my scores got better, even though I was not eating chocolate. Eventually I improved my sleep in Beijing but that seemed to make little difference. The comparison is far from perfect &#8212; many things varied &#8212; but by and large my scores got worse when I went from Beijing to Berkeley and improved when I went from Berkeley to Beijing. </p>
<p>What might have caused this? There are a hundred possibilities but one stands out. In both places, I brew and drink several cups of tea every day. In Beijing, everyone, including me, drinks water from big plastic bottles that are delivered to your house. You can choose pure water or &#8220;mineral&#8221; water, which has  added magnesium and potassium. In Berkeley I use tap water (Brita filtered). I don&#8217;t think potassium affects brain function &#8212; for example, eating bananas makes no difference &#8212; but there is <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/testing-magnesium-s-brain-boosting-effects-1.11665" target="_blank">plenty of evidence that magnesium improves brain function</a>. In Beijing I had tested a magnesium supplement and found no effect, consistent with the idea that I was already getting enough. Magnesium is also believed to improve sleep. In Beijing I seemed to sleep better than in Berkeley. Again, this is consistent with a difference in magnesium levels (more in Beijing). If ordinary magnesium-enriched water improves brain function, it would be significant because it is so easy, in contrast to <a href="http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2012/feb2012_Novel-Magnesium-Compound-Reverses-Neurodegeneration_01.htm" target="_blank">other ways of increasing magnesium levels</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six years ago I started using a reaction-time (RT) test (a test where you press a key in response to something as fast as possible) to track my brain function. I took the test daily. It must use only a small part of the brain but I assumed that something that made me faster would probably improve overall brain function. Behind this belief, which I call <strong>better RT, better brain</strong>, were countless studies of brain anatomy and physiology, which had shown that neurons and glial cells all over the brain share many features. Cells in different parts of the brain are much more alike than different. More support for this assumption was that <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">certain doses of flaxseed oil improved both RT and other measures of brain function</a>, such as balance.</p>
<p>I also assumed that changes that improved RT would probably improve overall health &#8212; what I call the<strong> better RT, better body</strong> assumption. It was less plausible than the <strong>better RT, better brain </strong>assumption because the cells in different organs of the body differ so much. They have many similarities but also many differences. I believed it for two reasons. (a) Flaxseed oil not only improved several measures of brain function, it improved my gums, no doubt because it reduced inflammation. It had been far from obvious that improving gums was so easy or that flaxseed oil (in the right dosage) would do so. The assumption <strong>better RT, better body</strong> had made a surprising prediction, you could say, that turned out to be true. (b) The brain gets much the same blood as the rest of the body. (Not exactly the same, because of the blood-brain barrier.) In the same way, all plug-in electrical appliances use the same house current. Just as all appliances have been designed to work well with that current, all our organs should have been shaped by evolution to work well with same mix of nutrients. You can&#8217;t feed your brain differently than your heart.</p>
<p>When I discovered that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">butter improved RT</a>, the <strong>better RT, better body</strong> assumption made a second even more surprising prediction: Eating more butter improved my health. This contradicted the claims of all mainstream health experts, who say saturated fats cause heart disease. I stuck with my assumption &#8212; I still eat a lot of butter. The data I&#8217;ve seen since then has supported my conclusion. For example, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/28/new-heart-scan-results-good-news/" target="_blank">my Agatston score got better</a>, not worse, after a year of eating lots of butter. The Agatston score is currently <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health-pictures/the-single-best-predictor-of-a-heart-attack.aspx#/slide-1" target="_blank">the best predictor of heart disease</a>.</p>
<p>I recently found more support for the <strong>better RT, better body </strong>assumption. Several studies have found that RT is a good predictor of health (better RT, better health). Even more impressive, it is a better predictor than many of the predictors we already know of. The RT test used in these studies is close to the test I now use, which I developed independently. The RT test in these studies involves showing a digit (0-4), after which the subject presses one of five keys (labelled 0-4) as fast as possible. My current RT test is very similar but uses 7 digits instead of 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15660853" target="_blank">A 2005 study</a> looked at the oft-reported correlation between higher IQ and lower mortality. The IQs and RTs of about 900 persons were measured in 1988. Deaths until 2002 were noted. RT was associated with lower mortality, even after taking out associations with smoking, education and social class. RT and IQ are correlated (better RT, higher IQ). When the RT-death association was removed, IQ no longer predicted death. So RT does a good job of capturing whatever it is about IQ that predicts mortality.</p>
<p><a href="http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/7.-Reaction-time-and-established-risk-factors-for-total-and-cardiovascular-disease-mortality.pdf" target="_blank">A 2009 study</a> compared RT to more conventional health predictors (&#8220;risk factors&#8221;). About 7,000 subjects were followed from 1984 to 2005. RT in 1984 was a good predictor of all-cause mortality compared to classic risk factors. Smoking was by far the best predictor, followed by RT. RT was a better predictor than physical activity, blood pressure, a questionnaire measuring &#8220;psychological distress&#8221;, resting heart rate, waist/hip ratio, alcohol intake, and body mass index.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17846257" target="_blank">A third study</a>, based on the same subjects as the 2009 study, found that amount of <em>decline</em> (slowing) in RT (from one test to a second test seven years later) predicted death. People with more decline were more likely to die.</p>
<p>All this supports studying how your RT is controlled by your environment, especially what you eat. You have to choose wisely what to study. The point is not to be as fast as possible regardless of everything else. Lots of drugs (stimulants, such as caffeine) decrease RT for short periods of time. I doubt they improve health. (If they harm sleep, they probably worsen health.) What makes sense is to look for two things: 1. <strong>Poisons</strong>. Things that slow you down. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">I discovered that tofu did so</a>. I gave several reasons for thinking that tofu affects many people this way, not just me. Billions of people eat tofu, unaware of this possibility. 2. <strong>Deficiencies</strong>. Study things that are missing from your life now but were likely to be present when we evolved. It is quite plausible that our ancient ancestors ate more omega-3 (in fish, but also in flaxseed) and more animal fat (from big animals, but also in butter) than we do now. My data suggest omega-3 and animal fat are nutrients necessary for health whose importance mainstream nutrition researchers have not fully appreciated.</p>
<p>My RT data have shown me there&#8217;s a lot I didn&#8217;t/don&#8217;t know about how my food affects me. Maybe everyone can say that. Unlike almost anyone else, however, I can reduce my ignorance myself. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/">I don&#8217;t need to rely on experts</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been testing my brain function daily for the last six years. I use a reaction-time test (see digit, type digit as fast as possible) that takes about five minutes. I have gradually improved the test over the years &#8212; this is about version 8. One reason for this testing is that I might observe a sudden change. That could suggest a new factor that affects brain function &#8212; whatever was unusual before the change (e.g., a new food). This is how I discovered <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">the effect of butter</a>. My score suddenly improved, I investigated. Another sudden change (improvement) happened soon after I switched from Chinese flaxseed oil to American flaxseed oil. I hadn&#8217;t realized that something was wrong with the Chinese flaxseed oil. I started brain tracking after I noticed a sudden improvement in balance the morning after I swallowed about five flaxseed oil capsules. Millions of people had taken flaxseed oil capsules, but no one, it seemed, had noticed the balance improvement. <em>Maybe other big changes in brain function go unnoticed</em>, I thought.</p>
<p><span id="more-12281"></span></p>
<p>A month ago, my score suddenly got worse (= I became slower). There was one unusual thing that day, before the test: I had eaten a piece of <em>bai fu ru</em>, a kind of fermented tofu popular in China. <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/09/chichis-chinese-fermented-bean-curd.html" target="_blank">To make it</a>, &#8220;cubes of tofu are first fermented, then soaked in brines that contain a number of ingredients: rice wine, vinegar, chili peppers, cinnamon, star anise, and red yeast rice, the last which imparts the deep red hue that you&#8217;ll see in certain varieties.&#8221; <a href="http://www.kcet.org/living/food/the-nosh/have-you-eaten/4-ways-to-enjoy-stinky-tofu-in-los-angeles.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a discussion of fermented tofu in Los Angeles. It&#8217;s popular in China. Most people use it as a condiment, but I ate small amounts (one cube)  alone.</p>
<p>To find out if the <em>bai fu ru</em> caused the worsening, I did a test. I deliberately ate one 20 g cube at 11 am. I do the brain tests in the afternoon, usually 4-5 pm. What happen to my brain score that day? Here are the results.</p>

<p>Each point is a different test. I conclude that the tofu slowed me down by about 20 ms and the effect lasted two days. I didn&#8217;t notice the change in other ways &#8212; I didn&#8217;t feel tired or slow, for example. Presumably that is why this has gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>I think these results reflect cause and effect for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Clarity</strong>. A <em>t</em> value would be very large.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Surprising prediction</strong>. A surprising prediction turned out to be true. Sharp drops like this are rare. Perhaps they happen once every 3-6 months.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Repetition</strong>. A research assistant found similar results, although not as clear. She is Chinese &#8212; quite different genetically.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Other evidence that tofu is bad for the brain</strong>. After I found these results, I remembered <a href="http://www.healthmegamall.com/Articles/BabeskinArticle260.pdf" target="_blank">an old study</a>. It found an association between midlife tofu consumption and late life cognitive decline among Japanese-American men in Hawaii (more tofu, more decline). <a href="http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/soy-online-service/Brain.htm#.UpVOQcRQKm4" target="_blank">A related study</a> of the same men found a correlation between cognitive decline and miso consumption. <a href="http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/141484" target="_blank">A later study of Indonesian men and women</a> also found a correlation between tofu consumption and cognitive decline (more tofu, more decline). The same study also found a <em>beneficial</em> weak correlation between tempeh consumption and cognitive decline (more tempeh, less decline). A weak epidemiological association found only once means little &#8212; epidemiologists, in my experience, do not adjust for the number of tests done and usually ignore the problem.  More recently, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23034522" target="_blank">an experiment using a mouse model of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</a> found that a high-soy diet made brain function worse.</p>
<p>Because of the other evidence, I conclude that all tofu (and other soybean foods, such as soy milk) probably impair brain function, not just this version, which contains slightly more than tofu. The other evidence involves lots of non-fermented tofu. Because of the other evidence and my assistant&#8217;s results, I believe these results will be true for other people.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t explain the effect. Tofu is high in omega-6, but the amount of omega-6 in 20 g of tofu is small. Others think that tofu impair brain function due to its isoflavones.</p>
<p>Most nutrition experts say tofu is good for you. Catherine Newman, in <em>O Magazine</em>, <a href="http://www.oprah.com/health/The-Health-Benefits-of-Tofu-and-Soy-Products" target="_blank">raves about it</a>. &#8220;In addition to being wonderfully inexpensive, tofu is high in protein, low in fat, and very low in saturated fat. . . .  One daily four-ounce [= 120 g] serving is an excellent addition to a healthy diet.&#8221; <a href="http://w3.newsmax.com/newsletters/mhr/issues/eat1012/mhr_eat1012_29.pdf" target="_blank"><em>The Mind Health Report</em> (October 2012)</a> says tofu is good for the brain. &#8220;For vegetarians, good choices are tofu, beans and eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Better informed experts criticize soy but say <em>fermented</em> soy is good. <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/09/18/soy-can-damage-your-health.aspx" target="_blank">Joseph Mercola</a> wrote,&#8221;For centuries, Asian people have been consuming fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits.&#8221; The <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/" target="_blank">Weston Price Foundation website</a> says a lot about the badness of soy but claims fermented soy is healthy. In an article about why unfermented soy is bad, <a href="http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/170-scientific-reasons-to-lose-the-soy-in-your-diet/" target="_blank">the Healthy Home Economist says</a>, &#8220;Please note that fermented soy in small, condimental amounts as practiced in traditional Asian cultures is fine for those who have healthy thyroid function [as I do -- Seth].&#8221; My 20 g dose was a small, condimental amount. John Robbins, author of <em>The Food Revolution </em>(2001), dismissed the association of tofu and dementia. <a href="http://www.foodrevolution.org/askjohn/52.htm" target="_blank">He argued</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s not all we know. We know, for example, that dementia rates are lower in Asian countries (where soy intake is high) than in western countries. We know that the Japanese lifestyle (with its high soy intake) has long been associated with longer life span and better cognition in old age. And we know that Seventh Day Adventists, many of whom consume soyfoods their whole lives, have less dementia in old age than the general population. . . . A number of clinical studies have shown that soy and isoflavones from soy are actually beneficial for cognition. . . . . Having studied the literature, soy researchers Mark and Virginia Messina conclude that “there is no reason to believe that eating soyfoods is harmful to brain aging.” [Robbins failed to mention that <a href="http://www.vegnutrition.com/about/index.html" target="_blank">Mark and Virginia Messina</a> own a "nutrition consulting company specializing in soyfoods nutrition" -- Seth]</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when the Messinas said this. Maybe there was once &#8220;no reason&#8221; to think soyfoods bad for the brain, but there is now.  The new evidence, epidemiology, and mouse evidence make a good case.</p>
<p>Here are two interesting things. 1. A very popular food is dangerous, maybe harmful. 2. Nutrition experts had claimed the opposite: the food is good for you. Even the better ones (Mercola, Weston Price Foundation) got it wrong, ignoring evidence (the epidemiology). It is a good example of experts overstating their understanding. The Shangri-La Diet is another example (every expert said sugar was fattening, I found it caused me to lose weight).</p>
<p>Even more interesting is the methodological implication. <em>Anyone can do what I did, with any food</em>. It&#8217;s easy, safe, cheap, and takes little time. The bad effects were large enough, and the method sensitive enough, that the bad effects were well above noise. And this is a non-trivial case. Tofu is popular.</p>
<p>We eat thousands of foods. We have millions of genotypes. We eat our food in millions of environments. Your genotype and environment affect how a food will affect you. So a good understanding of how foods affect us would seem to require thousands times millions times millions of tests. It is absurd to assume that anyone else (government, academia, industry) will do the necessary tests. They can&#8217;t <em>begin</em> to do the tests. In contrast to people doing a job (for example, people in government responsible for food safety) <strong>you</strong> have a much simpler problem: <strong>Is my food safe for me? </strong>You only care about one genotype (yours) and one context (yours) and you eat far fewer than thousands of foods. You can do good tests. You can test exactly what you eat in exactly the context you eat it. Compared to the present, where we extrapolate from epidemiology, animal tests, and the rare human experiment, the reduction in uncertainty and increase in generalizability is immense.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">If you want to do experiments like this &#8212; test foods one by one &#8212; with my software (which requires Windows), please contact me. The tests require a training period of 1-2 months so that the scores during an experiment are roughly constant.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, <a href="http://bolenreport.com/feature_articles/ddvbarrett%20amend.pdf" target="_blank">Doctor&#8217;s Data, an Illinois clinical lab, sued Stephen Barrett</a>, who runs Quackwatch, for making false and misleading statements about them. The lawsuit is still in progress. I am glad they sued. As far as I can tell, Quackwatch does contain false and misleading statements.<span id="more-11956"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten about fifteen hair tests &#8212; whenever I get my hair cut &#8212; from Doctor&#8217;s Data. The test measures about forty elements, such as mercury, tin, and selenium. One test costs about $60. One reason I test my hair is curiosity – who knows what I might learn? Another is concern about heavy metal exposure due to living in Beijing. In <a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hair.html" target="_blank">a post updated in 2010</a>, Barrett called hair tests &#8220;a cardinal sign of quackery&#8221;. I have no idea whether there is any truth to Barrett&#8217;s argument but I am sure he is too confident I am wasting my money. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/26/damage-due-to-mercury-revealed-by-brain-test/" target="_blank">My own data</a> suggest Barrett is wrong about the safety of mercury amalgam fillings. He believes that all safety concerns about those fillings are wrong. I found that when I had some of mine removed, my brain test scores improved starting exactly at the time of removal. We live in a world where all doctors &#8212; conventional and alternative &#8212; know almost nothing about the cause of almost any major health problem (heart disease, depression, obesity, and so on). Barrett shows no sign of understanding this. He is too sure that people who disagree with him are wrong.</p>
<p>Doctor&#8217;s Data is far from perfect. Their hair tests have three serious weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The information they provide customers like me comes without any information that would allow me to judge the error of measurement. I had to send in two samples from the same haircut to get some idea.</p>
<p>2. The measurements they give come with comparisons to  a group of supposedly normal people (“reference range”) but those people are not described, making it hard or impossible to interpret these comparisons.</p>
<p>3. They do not report calibration results. I would like to make comparisons across tests &#8212; e.g., from a test done this month to a test done six months ago. However, I have no idea about the stability of their equipment.</p>
<p>Many clinical labs have these problems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the information their hair test provides is far from worthless, as far as I can tell. It is hard to learn anything from one test due to the problems I mention (e.g., if a value is high it might be measurement error) but repeated testing is more interesting. If a value suddenly gets worse for several tests, that suggests a problem. <em>A</em><em>ny</em> pattern in your results might tell you something useful.</p>
<p>If Doctor&#8217;s Data hair tests <em>are</em> worthless, this would be easy to show. Get two samples of hair (at the same time) from each of ten people. Get all 20 samples tested. If there is no correlation between the two samples, the test is probably worthless. No one, including Barrett, has provided such evidence.</p>
<p>You can learn details of the lawsuit, which Tim Bolen is sure Barrett will lose, from <a href="http://www.bolenreport.com/feature_articles/Doctor's-Data-v-Barrett/Foison%20fluff.htm" target="_blank">Bolen&#8217;s website</a>. I have enjoyed reading about it &#8212; for example, <a href="http://bolenreport.com/feature_articles/Doctor%27s-Data-v-Barrett/may%20discovery%20fight.pdf" target="_blank">this complaint</a> about Barrett&#8217;s lawyer&#8217;s time-consuming method of discovery. Every story needs a villain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I discovered that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/">butter made me faster at arithmetic</a>, I started eating half a stick (66 g) of butter per day. After a talk about it, a cardiologist in the audience said I was killing myself. I said that the evidence that butter improved my brain function was much clearer than the evidence that butter causes heart disease. The cardiologist couldn&#8217;t debate this; he seemed to have no idea of the evidence.</p>
<p>Shortly before I discovered the butter/arithmetic connection, I had a heart scan (a tomographic x-ray) from which is computed an Agaston score, a measure of calcification of your blood vessels. The Agaston score is a good predictor of whether you will have a heart attack. The higher your score, the greater the probability. My score put me close to the median for my age. A year later &#8212; after eating lots of butter every day during that year &#8212; I got a second scan. Most people get about 25% worse each year.  My second scan showed regression (= improvement). It was 40% better (less) than expected (a 25% increase). A big increase in butter consumption was the only aspect of my diet that I consciously changed between Scan 1 and Scan 2.</p>
<p>The improvement I observed, however surprising, was consistent with <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/5/1175.full" target="_blank">a 2004 study</a> that measured narrowing of the arteries as a function of diet. About 200 women were studied for three years. There were three main findings. 1. <strong>The more saturated fat, the less narrowing</strong>. Women in the highest quartile of saturated fat intake didn&#8217;t have, on average, any narrowing. 2. <strong>The more polyunsaturated fat, the more narrowing</strong>. 3. <strong>The more carbohydrate, the more narrowing</strong>. Of all the nutrients examined, only saturated fat clearly reduced narrowing. Exactly the opposite of what we&#8217;ve been told.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/print/21896">this article</a> explains, the original idea that fat causes heart disease came from Ancel Keys, who omitted most of the available data from his data set. When all the data were considered, there was no connection between fat intake and heart disease. There has never been convincing evidence that saturated fat causes heart disease, but somehow this hasn&#8217;t stopped the vast majority of doctors and nutrition experts from repeating what they&#8217;ve been told.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DcSO8gWB0Z0?feature=player_detailpage" height="250" width="450" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Recently the Berkeley City Council heard testimony about a proposed ban on mercury amalgam dental fillings. A young man named D&#8212; M&#8212;, shown in the video, told the Council that he had grown up in Berkeley and had gotten mercury amalgam fillings from local dentists. They did not tell him the fillings were dangerous. He attended Berkeley High, Harvard, and finally the clinical psychology program at UC Berkeley &#8212; which I know is extremely hard to get into, as he says. They accept about 1 in 500 applicants.</p>
<p>In 2007, three years into the program, he started clenching his teeth. He began to have problems resembling mercury poisoning, such as fatigue and poor concentration. He had to leave the psychology program. Hair tests showed large amounts of mercury. He did not eat unusual amounts of fish, so it&#8217;s likely that his fillings were the source of the mercury. By 2012, he could no longer work and pay rent.</p>
<p>I had no idea that teeth clenching and mercury fillings were so dangerous together. A few years ago, I found, to my surprise, that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/26/damage-due-to-mercury-revealed-by-brain-test/" target="_blank">removal of mercury fillings improved my score on the reaction time test I use to measure brain function</a>. At first, I had thought the improvement had other causes. Only when I tested these causes and found no supporting evidence did I look further and discover the improvement had started exactly when I got my fillings removed. After I discovered this, I looked around for other evidence that mercury fillings were dangerous. To my surprise (again), my evidence seemed more persuasive than anything I found. M&#8212;&#8217;s story is much scarier than mine and supports my conclusion that mercury fillings are dangerous.</p>
<p>Had M&#8212; been using my reaction-time test day after day, he might have discovered deterioration on that test before he noticed other problems. The test might have provided early warning. I hadn&#8217;t noticed problems with concentration or fatigue, yet when my fillings were removed I got better on my test. Had M&#8212; noticed the problem earlier, he might have figured out the cause earlier.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t monitor yourself as I do &#8212; and almost no one does &#8212; you are trusting your dentist, your doctor, your food providers, and so on, to be well-informed <em>and</em> truthful about the safety of their products. If the problems aren&#8217;t obvious, there is plenty of reason for them to put their hands over their eyes and say &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know&#8221; about problems with their products. Drug companies have often hidden the dangers of their products and surgeons have hidden the dangers of their procedures. Few people grasp that &#8220;evidence-based medicine&#8221;, with <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html" target="_blank">its disregard of bad side effects</a>, is biased in favor of doctors. (<a href="http://www.badscience.net/">Ben &#8220;Bad Science&#8221; Goldacre</a> is a prominent example of someone who fails to understand this.) If you monitor yourself you are less at the mercy of other people&#8217;s poor science, lies, and motivations that conflict with finding and telling the truth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by <a href="http://plewis.info/" target="_blank">Peter Lewis</a></h4>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been practicing meditation on and off for years. It doesn’t interest me in a spiritual sense; I do it because I think it improves my mental function. However, what I’ve read suggests there isn’t a lot of evidence to support that. <span id="more-10861"></span>For example, <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2011/12/02/why-i-dont-dig-buddhism/" target="_blank">John Horgan in Scientific American</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meditation reportedly reduces stress, anxiety and depression, but it has been linked to increased negative emotions, too. Some studies indicate that meditation makes you hyper-sensitive to external stimuli; others reveal the opposite effect. Brain scans do not yield consistent results, either. For every report of heightened neural activity in the frontal cortex and decreased activity in the left parietal lobe, there exists a contrary result.</p></blockquote>
<p>From a 2007 <a href="http://archive.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/meditation/medit.pdf" target="_blank">meta-analysis</a> of 800+ studies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to validity in every major quality domain assessed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of this research asked questions different than mine. The studies used physical measures like blood pressure, studied complex states like depression and stress, or isolated, low-level &#8220;executive functions&#8221; like <a href="http://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2Fs13415-011-0048-8.pdf" target="_blank">working memory</a>. My question was simpler: Is mediation making me smarter? &#8220;Smarter&#8221; is a pretty complex thing, so I wanted to start with a broad, intuitive measure. There&#8217;s a free app called Math Workout (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.akbur.mathsworkout&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/math-workout/id497620537?mt=8" target="_blank">iPhone</a>) that I’ve been using for years. It has a feature called World Challenge that&#8217;s similar to what Seth <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/03/27/why-i-use-arithmetic-to-measure-brain-function/" target="_blank">developed to test his own brain function</a>: it gives you fifty arithmetic problems and measures how fast you solve them. Your time is compared to all other users in the world that day. This competitive element has kept me using it regularly, even though I had no need for better math skills.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Study Design</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong></strong>I only had about a month, so I decided on a 24-day experiment.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Measurement</strong>. Every day for the whole experiment, I completed at least four trials with Math Workout: three successive ones in the morning, within an hour of waking up, and at least one later in the day. For each trial, I recorded my time, number of errors and the time of day. Math Workout problems range from 2+2 to squares and roots. The first ten or so are always quite easy and they get more difficult after that, but this seems to be a fixed progression, unrelated to your performance. Examples of difficult problems are 3.7 + 7.3, 93 + 18, 14 * 7, and 12² + √9. If you make a mistake, the screen flashes and you have to try again on the same problem until you get it right. As soon as you answer a problem correctly, the next one appears.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>. I used an ABA design. For the first seven days, I just did the math, with no meditation. (I hadn&#8217;t been meditating at all during the 3-4 weeks before the start of the experiment.) For the next ten days, I meditated for at least ten minutes every morning within an hour of waking, and did the three successive math trials immediately afterward.  I did a simple breath-counting meditation, similar to what&#8217;s described <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/audiodharmacourse.org/mindfulness-meditation/counting-breaths" target="_blank">here</a>. The recorded meditations that I gave the other participants were based on Jon Kabat-Zinn&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction" target="_blank">Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction</a> program and also focused on awareness of breathing, though without the counting element. The final seven days were a second baseline period, with no meditation.</p>
<p>Before beginning, I posted about this experiment on Facebook, and I was pleasantly surprised to get eleven other volunteers who were willing to follow the same protocol and share their data with me. I set up online spreadsheets for each participant where they could enter their results. I also emailed them a guided ten-minute meditation in mp3 format. It was a fairly simple breathing meditation, secular and non-denominational.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Meditation had a small positive effect. During the meditation period, my average time to correctly answer 50 problems was 75 seconds, compared to 81 during the first baseline &#8212; a drop of 7% &#8212; and the times also dropped slightly over the ten days (slope of trendline: -0.6 seconds/day). When I stopped meditating, my times trended sharply back up (slope: 1.0 seconds/day) to an average of 78 seconds during the second baseline period. These trends suggest that the effect of meditation increased with time, which is in line with what most meditaters would tell you: the longer you do it consistently, the better it works. My error rates were more flat &#8212; from 2.1 errors per 50 correct answers in the first baseline period, to 2.2 during the meditation period and 2.5 during the second baseline &#8212; and did not display the same internal trends.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Of the other eleven subjects, six of them stuck with the experiment till the end. Their data was  messier, because they were new to the app and there’s a big practice effect. Because of this, I was less focused on finding a drop from the first control period to the meditation (which you’d expect anyway from practice) and looking more for an increase in times in the second control period (which you wouldn’t expect to see unless the meditation had been helping).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taking that into account, three of the six subjects seemed to me to display a similar positive effect to mine. Two I’d call inconclusive, and one showed a clear negative effect. (<a href="http://mechanicalbrain.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/med_other_subjects.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is the data for these other subjects.)</p>
<p><strong>What I Learned </strong></p>
<p>I found these results encouraging. Like Seth, I take this kind of basic math exercise to be a good proxy for general brain function. Anything that makes me better at it is likely to also improve my performance on other mental tasks. As I mentioned above, I&#8217;ve been using this particular app for years, and my times plateaued long ago, so finding a new factor that produces a noticeable difference is impressive. An obvious concern is that I was trying harder on the days that I meditated. Since it&#8217;s impossible to &#8220;blind&#8221; subjects as to whether they&#8217;ve meditated or not, I can&#8217;t think of a perfect way to correct for this. If meditation does make me faster at math, what are the mechanisms? For example, does it improve my speed at processing arithmetic problems, or my speed of recall at the ones that I knew from memory (e.g. times tables), or my decisiveness once I think I have an answer? It felt like the biggest factor was better focus. I wasn&#8217;t solving the problems faster so much as cutting down on the fractional seconds of distraction between them.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<p>It would have helped to have a longer first control period, as Seth and others advised me before I began. I was scheduled to present my results at <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/conference/Amsterdam-2013/" target="_blank">this conference</a> and at the time it was only a month away, so I decided to make the best of the time I had. Next time I&#8217;ll have a three- or four-week baseline period, especially if I&#8217;m including subjects who haven&#8217;t meditated before. The single biggest improvement would be to recruit non-meditators to follow the same protocol. Most of the other volunteers, like me, were interested because they were already positively disposed towards meditation as a daily habit. I don&#8217;t think they liked the idea of baseline periods when they couldn&#8217;t meditate, and this probably contributed to the dropout rate. (If I&#8217;d tried to put any of them in a baseline <em>group</em> that never meditated at all and just did math, I doubt any of that group would have finished.) It might be easier to recruit people who already use this app (or other math games) and get them to meditate than vice versa. That would also reduce the practice effect problem, and the effects of meditation might be stronger in people who are doing it for the first time. More difficult math problems might be a more sensitive measure, since I wouldn&#8217;t be answering them from memory. Nothing super-complex, just two- or three-digit numbers (253 + 178).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning to repeat this experiment myself at some point, and I&#8217;m also interested in aggregating data from others who do something similar, either in sync with me as above, or on your own timeline and protocol. I&#8217;d also appreciate suggestions for how to improve the experimental design.</p>
<p><strong>Comment by Seth</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way to improve this experiment would be to have longer phases. Usually you should run a phase until your measure stops changing <strong>and</strong> you have collected plenty of data during a steady state. (What &#8220;plenty of data&#8221; is depends on the strength of the treatment you are studying. Plenty of data might be 5 points or 20 points.) If it isn&#8217;t clear how long it will take to reach steady state, deciding in advance the length of a phase is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Another way to improve this experiment would be to do statistical tests that generate <em>p</em> values; this would give a better indication of the strength of the evidence. Because this experiment didn&#8217;t reach steady states, the best tests are complicated (e.g., comparison of slopes of fitted lines). With steady-state data, these tests are simple (e.g., comparison of means).</p>
<p>If you are sophisticated at statistics, you could look for a time-of-day effect (are tests later in the day faster?), a day-of-week effect, and so on. If these effects exist, their removal would make the experiment more sensitive. In my brain-function experiments, I use a small number of problems so that I can adjust for problem difficulty. That isn&#8217;t possible here.</p>
<p>These comments should not get in the way of noticing that the experiment answered the question Peter wanted to answer. I would follow up these results by studying similar treatments: listening to music for 10 minutes, sitting quietly for 10 minutes, and so on. To learn more about why meditation has an effect. The better you understand that, the better you can use it (make the effect larger, more convenient, and so on).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Brain tracking &#8212; frequent measurement of how well your brain is working &#8212; will become common, I believe, because brain function is important and because the brain is more sensitive to the environment (especially food) than the rest of the body. You will find it easier to decide what to eat if you measure your brain than if you measure other parts of your body. For example, I have used it to decide how much flaxseed and butter to eat. I have used R and the methodological wisdom of cognitive psychologists to make brain tracking tests. Alex Chernavsky, who lives in upstate New York, recently tried the most recent version:<br />
</em></p>
<p>In August, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/08/28/want-to-track-your-brain-function/" target="_blank">Seth solicited readers</a> to help him test a new brain-tracking program. I said I was interested.  I had a number of reasons for volunteering:</p>
<ul>
<li>My job involves working a lot with computers, so I thought I had a decent shot at ferreting out any bugs or usability issues.</li>
<li>I have been <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">tracking my weight daily for over eleven years</a>, so I was confident that I would have enough motivation to do the test on a regular basis.</li>
<li>I have a long-standing interest in neuroscience, so I was eager to help advance the field, even if in a very small way.</li>
<li>I’m in my late 40s, and I’ve noticed a distinct increase in my forgetfulness.   There are probably other, less-noticeable decreases in my cognitive function.  Thus I have an interest in finding ways to boost the performance of my brain.  Hacking brain function is obviously much easier if you can assay it via a quick, reliable proxy (i.e., reaction time).</li>
</ul>
<p>The program itself was relatively easy to set up.  The code is written in a free, open-source scripting language called R, so you have to install R on your Windows computer in order to run the program.  Upon downloading the script (which is contained within an R workspace), you have to edit a function to specify the Windows folder that contains the workspace file.  After that, you’re ready to go.</p>
<p>The three-month pilot study did not involve testing any hypotheses with regard to the effectiveness of interventions (for example, measuring reaction times before and after flaxseed oil).  My task was simply to perform the test once or twice a day.</p>
<p>Taking the test involves hitting a number key (2 through 8, inclusive) to match a random target number that is displayed on the screen.  The program measures the latency of your response.  If you hit the wrong key, the program forces you to repeat the same trial until you press the right key.  Reaction-times from these “correction trials” are not used in any subsequent data analysis.  A session consists of 32 individual trials and takes about four minutes to complete.</p>
<p>I performed the test daily for three months, although I did miss two days.  The test stopped short of being fun, but it was certainly not onerous.  The biggest hassle was having to wait for my laptop to boot into Windows.  If I had to do the pilot study over again, I would install R on both my home and my work desktop computers, so I could perform the test more easily (perhaps as a way to take a short break from whatever other task I happened to be working on).</p>
<p>The original plan was for me to email the R workspace to Seth once a week or so.  However, I suggested to Seth that we could improve efficiency by using a shared DropBox folder.  He agreed, and that is the method we adopted. Using this system, Seth had ongoing access to the latest data, and he could also easily make any bug-fixes or other edits that would take effect the next time I ran the script.</p>
<p>I did identify one bug in the script.  After each trial, the script briefly displays some feedback in the form of your reaction-time (in milliseconds) for that trial, your cumulative average for that session, and a percentile figure that compares your latest speed with past trials for that same target key.  I noticed that the percentile scores didn’t seem to make sense for some of the keys.  Seth examined his code and agreed that this was indeed a bug.  He made some adjustments and the bug was fixed.</p>
<p>I found that over time, as expected, my scores improved substantially.  They seemed to plateau after six weeks.  However, my accuracy suffered.  During the third month of the pilot study, I made a conscious effort to reduce my error rate.  I had some success, but I also found myself frustrated by my inability to reduce the errors as much as I would have liked.  Making errors, despite my best efforts, was the only  vexing part of taking the test.</p>
