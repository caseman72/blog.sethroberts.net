				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Allan Folz</h4>
<p>My wife had moderately severe postpartum depression (PPD) after the birth of our first child, a boy, in 2004. The depression lifted at the same time the nursing stopped, when he was about two years old. The pregnancy itself was without major or even minor problems so the depression was a big surprise. It was frustrating because nothing we did to alleviate it actually helped.<span id="more-13514"></span></p>
<p>With our second child, born in 2007, for the whole pregnancy we were worried she would experience it again. Thankfully she did not. There were a couple of differences between the two pregnancies. Our first baby was a boy and born with a complication during delivery. The placenta did not release. This caused to be transferred to a hospital, as it was a home birth. At the hospital she was given two units of whole blood. Our second baby was a girl, also born at home, and this time with no issues.</p>
<p>Her third pregnancy was in 2010 and this is where the story begins.</p>
<p>A couple months before she became pregnant, I had discovered paleo dieting following a link to <a href="http://freetheanimal.com/" target="_blank">Richard Nikoley&#8217;s blog</a>. I read about his experience and followed links to other sites in the paleosphere. The diet, the rationale behind it, and the numerous reports of other people having their health remarkably improved by it really resonated with me, so we adopted a lower-carb, paleo-style diet.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t have health problems that we were trying to correct for ourselves or a particular need to lose weight, outside of a few pounds for my wife relative to how much she weighed prior to her first pregnancy some six years before. However, I&#8217;ve always had an interest in health, medicine, and how the body functions. I even considered becoming an M.D. back in my undergrad days and minored in biology alongside my major in electrical engineering. I have a strong skepticism towards experts and what is the conventional wisdom in mainstream media sources. I think that&#8217;s why I almost immediately found Seth&#8217;s blog so intriguing, he questions the conventional wisdom and pushes people to take personal responsibility over their health and well-being. So, we were on a low to moderate carb diet, but weren&#8217;t fanatical about it. I remember that after my wife&#8217;s first visit with her midwives they were concerned by the ketones in her urine and strongly suggested she start eating more complex carbs. She followed their advice to be conservative. We were also supplementing Vitamin D and a little fish oil (a Mega-EPA omega-3 supplement). She was averaging 5K IU of Vitamin D a day, but only about one, 1 gram capsule once or twice a week of the fish oil. All in all, not much fish oil as I wasn&#8217;t sure how much was really necessary for people otherwise eating traditionally healthy, home-cooked meals, and I&#8217;m very skeptical of the diet supplement industry.</p>
<p>Late in the third trimester she started experiencing some moodiness. By itself, it probably would not have seemed atypical for a woman in her third trimester, but with my wife’s history we were far more sensitive to it and quick to take notice. Paying close attention (and long before discovering Seth&#8217;s blogging on self-experimentation), I eventually realized the moodiness happened when we’d skipped taking fish oils mid-week. If she didn’t take any mid-week, by Saturday it was very noticeable that her mood was on the short-tempered side. Once I noticed the connection, and without telling her what I was doing (i.e. single-blind), I’d deliberately skip the mid-week dose one week and note her weekend temper and mood. The following week I’d be sure she took a capsule mid-week. Next week back to skipping. Then, just to be sure, I had her double-dose one week. The double-dose had her in the best mood of all.</p>
<p>At first I was amazed. It was so neat, so mechanical &#8212; like flipping a switch. But it occurred to me that if two capsules in a week vs. one was enough to noticeably change her mood then she was obviously deficient as every mg was being put to use with no spare capacity in her system. I wondered if her body was scavenging omega-3 from her own brain for the developing fetus. That was a sobering thought. After that she went to supplementing daily and had no mood issues throughout the rest of the pregnancy or while breast feeding. She did have some of the typical “baby blues” that set in at the three day mark, but they did not last long. Also, she had good days and bad days, like anyone would. I&#8217;d say the omega-3 returned her to her normal bearing, irrespective of the demands of pregnancy and nursing.</p>
<p>There is zero doubt in my mind that omega 3 helped both my wife deal with a severe and yet all too stereotypical mental health problem. I&#8217;m a pretty sharp, pretty well-read guy who&#8217;s always had an interest in biology and medicine. After the experience with our son&#8217;s weaning, I wondered if nursing could cause or complicate PPD. </p>
<p>Seven years ago, when my wife was pregnant for the second time, I had searched the web for material related to those two (nursing and PPD) and came up empty-handed. I know I&#8217;ve never read something dealing with those two in mainstream outlets because it&#8217;s the type of thing I would mentally file away for future reference if the situation ever came up. It seemed like I was the only one willing to consider there might be a connection between them. Diet suggestions for nursing mothers are full of the usual bromides about getting enough complex carbs, fiber, and protein. Search engine auto-completes on “postpartum depression” don&#8217;t offer “omega-3” or “diet” anywhere in the top 10. You have to type the first two letters of each before they pop-up as auto-complete options. Today, the first hit for “postpartum depression diet” (I use Bing) is http://www.postpartum-living.com/depression-diet.html, which makes absolutely no mention of fats or lipids. It mentions vitamins, of course, but, incredibly, nothing specific.</p>
<p>During the two years my wife had PPD after her first pregnancy, no one suggested omega-3. At the time, I attributed her PPD to the delivery complications and the blood transfusion. I knew that depression is well-known among heart-attack survivors and IVF recipients, and, in my opinion, IVF is a pretty severe complication. Among the health professionals she saw about her PPD, the only thing the MD did was give her a prescription for Prozac or something similar, which she didn&#8217;t use because, well, of course &#8212; she was nursing. Had she quit nursing to take the prescription we would have attributed the improvement to the drug when it actually came from ceasing nursing. The naturopathic practitioners &#8212; she saw two different ones &#8212; gave her B-12 shots, SAM-e, melatonin, and a bunch of useless diet advice that one could read at all the usual places. The B-12 was good for a 24-48 hour energy boost. Other than that, none of them made the slightest difference.</p>
<p><i>Part 2, about using omega-3 to treat ADHD, will appear tomorrow. Allan Folz is a software developer in Portland, Oregon. He recently co-founded <a href="http://www.EdisonGauss.com" target="_blank">Edison Gauss Publishing</a>, a software house that makes academically rigorous educational apps for children in grades K-8. Their apps are suitable both classroom and home use, and have proven to be particularly popular among homeschoolers that appreciate a traditional approach to practicing math.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by August Hurtel</h4>
<p>I live in Shreveport, Louisiana and work in the interlibrary loans department at Shreve Memorial library. I am 39 years old.</p>
<p>I believe, due to experiences I will expand upon below, that excess sulfur compounds, especially sulfites, may contribute to and even cause irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). If you have IBS, you can try to verify this in a few ways.</p>
<p>1) Try molybdenum. I take Carlson Lab’s Moly-B 500 mcg tablets (one tablet/day).</p>
<p>2) Avoid <a href="http://www.livingnetwork.co.za/chelationnetwork/food/high-sulfur-sulphur-food-list/">foods and supplements high in sulfur</a>.</p>
<p>3) If you have already purchased the services of 23&amp;me or want to, you can look at this thread in the forums &#8212; <a href="https://www.23andme.com/you/community/thread/22714/">“Reactions to food containing sulfites, sulfur dioxide, bisulfite, metabisulfite. SUOX gene”</a> &#8212; and see if you have the same polymorphisms, though if you just do the first two, you&#8217;ll be able to guess.<span id="more-13386"></span></p>
<p>The woman who started that thread at 23&amp;me goes by the name Red Ringlets. She asked if anyone with four polymorphisms involved in sulfur processing experience reactions to sulfur compounds commonly added to foods as preservatives and/or for antibacterial purposes. I have three of these polymorphisms. I knew I was allergic to certain medicines, but I had not thought about the effect of sulfur coming from my food and supplements largely because I associated reactions to sulfur with hives and headaches.</p>
<p>Several years ago <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=6389.msg69839#msg69839">once the appetite suppression the Shangri-La diet kicked in</a>, I adopted what most would consider a paleo template for my diet. This means I generally avoid grains, legumes, and dairy with caveats (like rice, now that I work out, and butter because it is animal fat and therefore good according to evolutionary thinking). Additionally a substantial amount of the meat that I buy comes from conventional sources.</p>
<p>Despite not being technically paleo, I enjoyed coffee, chocolate, and red wine, which are all high in sulfur. Sulfur is also added to various coconut products, shrimp, fish, dried fruit &#8212; many products a person trying to eat paleo might eat. I ate them. And I would have gastrointestinal distress that I could not explain despite getting leaner.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2013 after a few social functions that served grilled hamburgers, grilled shrimp, and other summer party foods a paleo dieter might think would be okay, I went to the emergency room. I had a serious pain where my appendix should be. Sometimes the pain would get worse after eating, and I would often get diarrhea. I thought I had appendicitis, but the doctors found nothing wrong. They took regular X-rays and did blood tests, and came back and said they found nothing. I got really angry about that, so they ordered a CT scan. The CT scan also showed nothing. They told me I had IBS because they had gone through a list of other things it might be and eliminated all of them.</p>
<p>When I went to the emergency room, I also inadvertently took with me a large amount of sulfur. I had a couple of 90% Lindt bars with me. My chocolate intake had risen during that time, too. I had stuff to do, places to go &#8212; and an excuse to treat chocolate like a food group.</p>
<p>I was aware, from reading on the internet, of FODMAPs, which are osmotic carbohydrates that draw water into the gut, causing gas, bloating, cramping and diarrhea. They seemed a likely culprit because these were the symptoms I experienced. Following a <a href="http://stanfordhospital.org/digestivehealth/nutrition/DH-Low-FODMAP-Diet-Handout.pdf">low FODMAP diet</a> seemed to help, but not perfectly so.</p>
<p>There is some overlap between the two lists of foods to avoid (high sulfur and high FODMAP), so avoiding FODMAPs might have helped because it made me avoid sulfur. It also made it possible for me to have days where I didn&#8217;t eat any FODMAP foods but I would eat something like shrimp and then I&#8217;d have symptoms despite not eating any FODMAPs. So, looking back on it, I think of attending a wedding, eating nothing but shrimp, and drinking a little bit of red wine, and then having IBS problems and not understanding why because it doesn&#8217;t fit in well with the FODMAP story. I think FODMAPs are problematic in a gut that has already been compromised, but FODMAPs are not evolutionarily novel, and thus are unlikely to be the original cause of the problem.</p>
<p>Since it was summer and I just gotten through that ER experience, I stopped eating a lot of fruits, chocolate, wine, etc. One of the things that figures largely for me as a source of sulfur during this time though is shrimp. I kept thinking it was a safe food to eat, and didn’t realize until later it was a source of sulfur. Additionally, I was taking several supplements that contained sulfur: gelatin, biotin, glutathione, NAC, ALA, MSM. I had gotten into the habit of trying different supplements since 2010 because of a neuralgia that neither doctors nor dentists could explain. Though I was not taking all of them at once, I did supplement enough to assume I kept my sulfur level high throughout this time period.</p>
<p>I noticed the thread Red Ringlets posted at 23&amp;me in August of 2013. In October I asked whether or not sulfur could cause a dehydrating effect. I asked this because I’ve noticed wine can take more water out of me than other drinks containing alcohol do. I didn’t get an answer to that question, but I began to explore some of the links people had put into the thread. I read through this site: <a href="http://www.learningtarget.com/nosulfites/">www.learningtarget.com</a>. I found the following page particularly helpful because it mentioned that molybdenum is a vital part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfite_oxidase">sulfite oxidase</a> enzyme: <a href="http://www.learningtarget.com/nosulfites/vitamins.htm">Vitamins and Supplements for Sulfite Problems</a>.</p>
<p>I still had not made a connection between sulfur and irritable bowel syndrome, but I decided to supplement with fucoidan, which is a sulfated polysaccharide found in some seaweeds. I thought it would help my gut, but it caused diarrhea. It was as if I had decided to supplement with cholera. The effect was large and obvious enough for me to realize it was probably the supplement I had just taken. Once I accepted that, I put together what I had learned from the 23&amp;me thread.</p>
<p>Now, in retrospect, I think fucoidan may have caused diarrhea for completely different reasons. I learned in my 23&amp;me health report that I am norovirus resistant, and I have subsequently read that this has something to do with my ability (or inability) to make fucose. I can&#8217;t remember where I read this, but it made me think fucoidan could have destabilized my gut flora for reasons unrelated to its sulfur content.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the extreme reaction to fucoidan, I decided the beneficial reaction to molybdenum meant that I had a genetically limited capacity to deal with all the extra sulfur in my food and supplements. I threw out my high sulfur supplements and tried to stick to low sulfur foods. Within about two weeks I started having normal bowel movements. This was better than what I was achieving before the entire fucoidan fiasco. I had migrated to a diet of rice and fish which helped me approximate normalcy, but any time I tried to have any variety in my diet, I would run into problems. By avoiding sulfur, I was able to eat a larger variety of foods without incident.</p>
<p>Eventually I found if I was very careful, I could eat small amounts of high sulfur foods, but this is hit or miss because I can&#8217;t reliably gauge what the potential dose is, nor is it always clear whether a food has sulfur in it. I still supplement with molybdenum but I think the long term strategy here is both molybdenum and at least avoiding high sulfite foods because my genetics suggest it is doubtful I am going to be able to process as many sulfites as other people do regardless of how much molybdenum I have.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I think once the gut is compromised, many things become irritants. Removing excess sulfur has increased my health a lot, but I suspect I need to improve gut flora, and possibly heal some tissue damage. The doctors may not be able to see it, but I still have residual pain in the region where my appendix is.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walmart sells <a href="http://www.relion.com/diabetes/a1c-test" target="_blank">a kit for home measurement of HbA1c</a> (brand name ReliOn) that costs $9 and provides results by email. It&#8217;s sold only at Walmart. I have been paying $30 for the same measurement at a test center (about 30 minutes away). If you use insurance, copay might be $15. Without insurance, a doctor&#8217;s office test might cost $90. The reviews suggest the test has roughly the same variability and average as a lab test. A few people had trouble getting enough blood on the dots but at $9 there is plenty of room for repeat testing.</p>
<p>My blood sugar improved when I started to walk an hour per day and when I started intermittent fasting (eating about half as much as usual every other day). I noticed the effects with blood sugar tests but frequent HbA1c tests (say, once/week) would have been much better.</p>
<p>Diabetes has become an enormous problem in China, where 10% of adults have Type 2 diabetes, roughly the same as in America. Americans often think obesity causes diabetes but this doesn&#8217;t explain why smoking &#8212; which makes people thinner &#8212; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11063954" target="_blank">is associated with diabetes</a>. People get diabetes who don&#8217;t smoke and aren&#8217;t fat. Whether anyone who walks an hour/day gets diabetes is less clear.</p>

<p>This graph shows recent results from the test I used to track my brain function. The test is a choice reaction task done on my laptop: see a digit (e.g.,&#8221;2&#8243;), press the corresponding key as fast as possible. The <em>x</em> axis shows the time of the test. The ticks (&#8220;Sat&#8221;, etc.) mark the beginning of the associated days. The <em>y</em> axis shows the average percentile of the reaction times. Higher percentile = faster. (Let me explain what &#8220;percentile&#8221; means: Each reaction time is compared to earlier reaction times with the same stimulus, and its percentile is computed. For example, a percentile of 60 means that 60% of previous responses were slower.) An average of 60 is quite good and 40 is quite bad. I usually do two tests per day, one right after the other, in the late afternoon (e.g., 4:30 pm).<span id="more-13109"></span></p>
<p>On Friday and Saturday, my scores were close to normal. On Sunday afternoon, however, my scores were much worse than usual; the average score was about 15. A score that low might happen once per year. The next day (Monday) I tested more often than usual &#8212; both morning and afternoon &#8212; and my scores gradually returned to normal. On Tuesday I also tested both morning and afternoon. My scores were ordinary the whole time. This showed that the improvement Monday morning was not normal.</p>
<p>What happened Sunday? I am pretty sure the problem is my lunch at a middle-cost noodle restaurant whose English name is <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294212-d5482531-Reviews-Flying_Noodle-Beijing.html" target="_blank">Flying Noodle</a>. It is close to the Tsinghua campus but I&#8217;d only been there once before (and eaten almost nothing that time). On Sunday I had a small pickled vegetable dish and an ordinary-sized plate of fried eggs and tomatoes. I suspect the problem is the oil used to cook the egg and tomato. It might have been soybean, corn, sunflower or peanut oil, all high in omega-6. (There are also complaints about reuse of cooking oil.) As I entered the restaurant, I worried about the oil, but also thought <i>who really knows? </i>By the time of my brain test, I had forgotten my concern.</p>
<p>A friend was with me. She ate different dishes. She found that her scores on a iPhone game she often plays, which requires fast reactions, were suddenly and mysteriously worse after the lunch. Then, in about a day, they recovered.</p>
<p>This interests me in several ways:</p>
<p>1. <strong>New phenomenology</strong>. In this example and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">my earlier tofu results</a> (a piece of fermented tofu reduced my brain score for two days), I noticed something never noticed before: Sharp changes (bad) in brain function. Fortunately I quickly recovered. Nobody knew this happened. It&#8217;s like looking through a microscope or telescope for the first time, but with much more relevance to everyday concerns. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Comparison with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me" target="_blank"><i>Super Size Me</i></a></strong>, a 2004 documentary by Morgan Spurlock, which argued that McDonald&#8217;s food was unhealthy. Spurlock ate only McDonald&#8217;s food for 30 days. Realism: Spurlock ate far more McDonald&#8217;s food than anyone would normally eat; I ate one meal. Information value: Spurlock&#8217;s test was so unrealistic and his diet so plainly unhealthy that I doubt the results &#8212; Spurlock&#8217;s health got worse, he gained weight &#8212; have any implications for the rest of us. In contrast, I find my results horrifying. Bias: Spurlock was obviously biased against McDonald&#8217;s before he started. I thought favorably of the Flying Noodle &#8212; that&#8217;s why I went there. Cost: My data cost essentially nothing, Spurlock&#8217;s movie <a href="http://www.filmeducation.org/pdf/film/SuperSizeMe.pdf" target="_blank">cost $65,000</a>, not to mention the damage to Spurlock&#8217;s health. Recovery time: Spurlock took 14 months to lose the weight he gained. I recovered in a day. Repeatability: My test is easy to repeat, Spurlock&#8217;s very difficult.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Public health disaster?</strong> China has a very high rate of diabetes, for unknown reasons. Chinese teenagers and college students have much worse (inflamed) skin than I see in other countries. Old people in China look much worse than old people in Japan. Could heavy use of high-omega-6 cooking oil be a big reason? </p>
<p>4. <strong>Where were authorities?</strong> We expect our government &#8212; in combination with academia &#8212; to protect us against dangerous chemicals in our environment. If I&#8217;m right about the cause of my low score, that didn&#8217;t happen here. Cooking oil is the opposite of a rare food. If ordinary amounts of a common cooking oil did cause these results, it suggests something is seriously wrong with the regulatory system. A big argument for personal science &#8212; and brain tracking in particular &#8212; is that you monitor exactly the environment to which you are exposed in exactly the genetic context you care about (yours).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://medium.com/the-magazine/4472ea75fdd6" target="_blank">An article about DIY medical devices</a> &#8212; devices created outside of big companies &#8212; does illustrate the predatory nature of our health care system:</p>
<blockquote><p>It can still be difficult for inventors to break into the medical-device market. Amy Baxter, a pediatrician specializing in pain management, found this out firsthand. When her four-year-old son developed a fear of needles, Baxter set up shop in her basement and created <a href="http://buzzy4shots.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buzzy</a>, a vibrating ice pack shaped like a bee that numbs the sting of injections. . . She says, “I decided to use my solution as a mother to be a better — more globally impactful — doctor.” Baxter held randomized controlled trials comparing the device to ethyl chloride spray and published the results. But when she launched the product in 2009, she found it nearly impossible to get her product into hospitals.</p>
<p>“It’s the nature of the system marketing to hospitals to pad prices and make items disposable to ensure repeat sales,” she says. Medical sales reps paid on commission will only take the time to push a new product if it is very expensive, with a high profit margin, or if it’s a cheap item that has to be reordered often, she says. “A reusable, low-cost product doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>On the other end, she says, hospitals’ complex budgetary processes often disconnect the physicians who order products — and pass the price on to patients and insurance companies — from their true cost. “Decisions to buy aren’t as straightforward as looking at a catalog,” she says. “There is no easy way to comparison shop, and less incentive in the medical environment.”</p>
<p>The result of all this inefficiency [which curiously works only in one direction -- to make things worse for consumers and better for health care professionals], Baxter says, is not only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/health/as-hospital-costs-soar-single-stitch-tops-500.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">notoriously inflated hospital prices</a> — like $36.78 for a $0.50 Tylenol with codeine pill and $154 for a $19.99 neck brace — but also a high barrier to entry for devices like Buzzy, which is currently available only online, with no marketing beyond word of mouth.</p></blockquote>
<p>A predatory relationship is one where one side is much more powerful than the other side and uses that power to take from the other side.</p>
<p>The article says nothing about science &#8212; better understanding of the connection between environment and health. Science is so poorly understood by so many people that even a doctor, such as Baxter, fails to understand that it exists:</p>
<blockquote><p>The more people become involved in medical making, says Baxter, the less the human body will seem like a mysterious black box whose problems and solutions are only within the realm of experts. [Not true. Making is not science. There is still a great need for science -- Seth] “The truth is,” she says, “the place where the body interfaces with the rest of the world is just engineering.”</p></blockquote>
<p>No, it isn&#8217;t just engineering. There is a vast amount we don&#8217;t know about the world&#8217;s effect on the body. Even a small improvement in understanding how environment (including food) controls health (e.g., how to sleep better) can easily be worth billions of dollars per year, more than all DIY medical devices put together. And knowledge (and the associated benefits) spreads at no cost at all, in contrast to medical devices.</p>
<p>Engineers assume people will get sick. Scientists do not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I finished <i>The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty</i> by Nina Munk, I thought of something a graduate student in English had told me: <em>A little Derrida goes a long way and a lot of Derrida goes a little way</em>. It was literally true. A few sentences by Derrida, you could think about for days, maybe productively. A whole book by him was baffling and irritating. <em>A lot of Jeffrey Sachs goes a little way</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>When it came out (2005), I thought <i>The End of Poverty</i> by Sachs was the ravings of a lunatic. Munk&#8217;s book shows I was right but I had to admit that George Soros giving Sachs $100 million or whatever to put his ideas into practice (to &#8220;test&#8221; them) was considerably more interesting than the activities of the other billionaires Munk had written about before Sachs. Soros had an advisory board whose reaction to Sachs&#8217;s ideas was the same as mine but Soros overruled them. Soros was right. A tiny bit was learned from spending all that money, which is better than learning nothing. Certainly I learned more than if the money had been used to buy a private jet.</p>
<p>As an assistant professor doing animal learning experiments, I saw over and over that it was incredibly hard to learn anything. Anything. No doubt all science professors who are honest learn this. But then I saw something that is less easy to see: If doing the &#8220;right&#8221; thing pays off worse than we expect &#8212; Sachs&#8217;s flamboyant failure in Africa is an example &#8212; then <strong>doing the &#8220;wrong&#8221; thing should pay off better</strong>. If spending an enormous amount of money we learn less than expected, then when we spend very little money we should learn more than expected. This is the upside of ignorance. The less you know, the easier it is to learn more. And we know much less than famous professors, such as Sachs, say we know.</p>
<p>My personal science is the polar opposite of what Sachs did. He tried to help others (poor Africans), I try to help myself. He tries to help people he knows almost nothing about, I try to help myself &#8212; and I know a lot about myself. He tried to do something big (end poverty). I try to do something small (e.g., sleep better). What he did cost millions of dollars. What I do costs nothing. I can test a new idea about how to sleep better in days. Sachs took years to test his ideas. For me, failure costs almost nothing. Sachs&#8217;s failure cost him years of his life. You have to be an extraordinary person with great talent to do what Sachs did. Whereas anyone can do personal science.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by <a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Shant Mesrobian</a></h4>
<p>At some point during the last decade, while living in Washington D. C., I began to suffer from hand eczema.  Painful red itchy inflamed dry skin covered most of my hands. It was usually triggered by cold dry weather in the fall and winter. It also flared up after a lot of cleaning — when my hands were exposed to a lot of water and soap, which dried them out. I was in my twenties when it began.<span id="more-12985"></span></p>
<p>Eczema, also called <i>atopic dermatitis</i>, is believed to be a too-extreme allergic reaction. It is common. About 10% of American adults suffer from it, according to two recent surveys (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17498413" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559989" target="_blank">here</a>). In my case, a certain level of dryness is required. I believe the dryness, which may reduce a protective coating, allows something in the environment, like dust or pollen, to trigger an allergic inflammatory response.</p>
<p>The first thing I did to solve the problem was see a dermatologist, who prescribed a steroid-based cream. The cream did reduce the inflammation. It was just something to apply when the inflammation appeared. It didn&#8217;t stop it from happening. As I learned more about eczema, I decided this was an absurd solution. Steroids have nothing to do with the cause of eczema. At best they treated the symptoms, and had bad side effects (is anything creepier than “skin thinning”?). </p>
<p>Then a funny thing happened. A few years ago, my eczema disappeared. I didn’t notice it had stopped until this fall (2013), when it came back. I had forgotten about it. As soon as the weather turned cold and dry, it hit hard. </p>
<p>Why had it disappeared and returned? My environment had not changed in any big way. Nor, when I first thought about it, could I think of any dietary changes in the past year or two. Then I realized I had made a dietary change – and recently. In September (2013), I had stopped eating a few fermented foods that I had steadily eaten for the past few years — sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha. I had drank kombucha only a few times a month but had eaten sauerkraut or kimchi almost daily (3-4 forkfuls/day, $0.50/day). I had started eating them in 2011, hoping they would improve my health. The last time I had had eczema was the winter before I began regularly eating them. </p>
<p>Had the fermented food prevented eczema? This was not far-fetched. The ideas that (a) bacteria in food can influence your immune system and that (b) bacterial exposure can “calm down” an over-reactive immune system are both well-accepted. Review articles are <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/130/2/403.long" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-387-74087-4_17" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/5/6/1869" target="_blank">here</a>. There is lots of supporting evidence. An early example is the evidence behind the hygiene hypothesis – children in “dirty” places had fewer allergies than children in cleaner places. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351/" target="_blank">This article</a> says “approximately 70% of the entire immune system” is in the gastrointestinal system.<br />
Fermented vegetables like sauerkraut and kimchi are dominated by the bacterial species Lactobacillus plantarum. If sauerkraut and kimchi had prevented eczema, it was probably due to L. plantarum. </p>
<p>After multiple flares over a few months, I tested this idea. I found a probiotic supplement (Jarrow Formulas Ideal Bowel Support) solely composed of L. plantarum. Then I waited for my eczema to flare up again. When it did (early January 2014), I began taking the supplement (one pill daily, $0.50/day). Within three days, the eczema had completely disappeared. In the past, three days after it started the eczema got worse. It usually lasted about two weeks from start to disappearance. I had never seen it disappear like this. Usually at this point (3 days after it started) hand washing would be painful and make it worse. Now I could hand wash with abandon. Even more amazing: I could walk around outside during a cold spell without gloves, and did not have any exacerbation or return of symptoms. Being able to do these things three days into a flare up had never happened before. </p>
<p>I kept taking the supplement (one pill/day). In the past, before the fermented foods, I had at least some inflammation on my hands through the entire fall and winter, with extreme periods and less extreme periods. Now (February 2014) I have zero inflammation. In the past, dryness on my hands immediately led to inflammation. In normal people, dry hands are dry hands. I never have just dry hands. Dryness is a trigger. I&#8217;m not used to seeing a dry hand without inflammation on it. For the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve had mildly dry hands without inflammation. I&#8217;ve become a normal person with dry hands. </p>
<p>Several studies – which I didn’t know about when I saw that the probiotic supplement helped &#8212; support the idea that L. plantarum can reduce eczema. Two studies (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338447" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22726349" target="_blank">here</a>) found that <i>L. plantarum</i> inhibited house-dust-mite-induced eczema in mice. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210038" target="_blank">Another study</a> found that <i>L. plantarum</i> inhibited allergic reaction and histamine-induced scratching (itching is a hallmark symptom of eczema) in mice. It concluded that <i>L. plantarum</i> “may improve allergic diseases, such as . . . atopic dermatitis”. In <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19120072" target="_blank">another mouse study</a>, <i>L. plantarum</i> was successfully used to reduce dust mite allergy. The most impressive evidence was from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24094544" target="_blank">a 2012 study</a> done with children in South Korea. All of them had eczema. Those given <i>L. plantarum</i> improved much more over 14 weeks than those given a placebo. </p>
<p>In contrast to my success, many studies have found no effect of probiotic supplements on eczema. <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-treatment-of-allergic-disease" target="_blank">One review</a> concluded “Initial meta-analyses suggest no benefit of probiotics [supplements] in the treatment of eczema or asthma.” Maybe they tested the wrong bacteria or used a too-small dose. I haven’t noticed any effect of yogurt (which contains different bacteria) on my eczema.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/l-plantarum-cured-my-eczema/" target="_blank">I posted about this in my blog</a>, several people tried something similar and reported what happened. Overall <a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/kimchi-sauerkraut-experimenters-a-distinct-pattern-emerges/" target="_blank">I would summarize their results as modest improvement</a>. The most positive result was this: “After 5 days of radish kimchi the eczema in that person [a family member] is very clearly receding and, in a few spots, is completely gone. From prior experience, it would not have done this on its own.” The least positive result was no change, which a few people noticed.</p>
<p>My interpretation is that kimchi and sauerkraut – that’s what everyone tried &#8212; have far less <i>L. plantarum</i> than the probiotic supplement I took. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.02030.x/abstract" target="_blank">This article</a> considered sauerkraut “probiotic” when the concentration of <i>L. plantarum</i> was “higher than 10^6 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of product”.<br />
<a href="http://shop.goldminenaturalfoods.com/GOLD-MINE-ORGANIC-RAW-SAUERKRAUT-16-OZ/productinfo/1901-1916/" target="_blank">This sauerkraut maker</a> says their sauerkraut has 8 x 10^6 CFU per gram. A serving of sauerkraut might be 60 g, so the total number of <i>L. plantarum</i> in one serving will be roughly 5 x 10^8. In contrast, the probiotic supplement I took supposedly contained 10^10 CFU – a factor of one hundred more.  A daily dose of 5 x 10^8 CFU might eliminate eczema if you eat it for months, as I did, but might produce much more modest results after just a week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reader writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I suffered from moderate acne as a teen, which continued well into my adult years. In my early forties, I sought help from a dermatologist, hoping that progress had been made since my teenage experience which included tetracycline and sunlamp therapy to induce drying and peeling. I was disappointed to have this doctor recommend basically the same treatment twenty five years later. I declined.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a friend recommended drinking lots of water, and I began doing so, attempting to drink eight glasses a day. This was in December. The acne actually got worse . . . but I received a Brita water filter pitcher for Christmas and began drinking filtered water. Within a week my skin was totally clear, and remained so with minimal exception thereafter, even when my water consumption waned over the years. I was delighted and grateful to have found such a simple and healthy solution, and annoyed that no doctor had even suggested it.</p>
<p>But about 15 years later &#8212; about a year ago &#8212; I began to experience significant breakouts again, this time confined largely to my nose. I assumed that I needed to simply up my water intake again. This time it didn&#8217;t help. Maybe the filter was overdue for a change, I thought (we&#8217;d long since upgraded to a reverse osmosis filter), so I had it changed but still no improvement in my skin.</p>
<p>I began cutting out various foods, eggs, coconut oil, whey protein, things I was eating lots of, thinking maybe I&#8217;d developed a sensitivity. Nothing worked, although I did see immediate improvement when visiting family in the states, which made me wonder if it was the change in the water. So  back home I tried to drink bottled water or club soda exclusively and it seemed to help maybe slightly.</p>
<p>I continued to search for a more complete solution. While perusing several online blogs devoted to acne treatment, I read a comment from a self-described longtime sufferer who claimed to have recently discovered a cure for his acne &#8212; milk thistle and NAC [n-acetyl-cysteine]. I got some milk thistle, took a few capsules a day for maybe three days, and voila, clear skin again. I never had reason to add NAC since the milk thistle worked so well.</p>
<p>I have reduced water consumption to normal levels (meaning I try to drink several glasses daily but don&#8217;t bother to track), take a few milk thistle capsules a week (don&#8217;t track that either), and only start to get breakouts if I happen to miss taking any for about a month, which I did just recently over the holidays. I still don&#8217;t know what causes the acne, and I don&#8217;t know why the milk thistle &#8220;cures&#8221; it, but it works wonderfully for me.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.acneeinstein.com/studies-reveal-almost-irrefutable-evidence-for-the-root-cause-of-acne/" target="_blank">Here</a> is more evidence for the effectiveness of milk thistle for acne.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/books/review/charles-dickens-biographies-review.html?_r=1&amp;nl=books&amp;emc=booksupdateema4&amp;pagewanted=all">a review of biographies of Charles Dickens</a> I found this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1849 he showed a short account of his early years to his close friend John Forster, revealing a story he never told his own family: the shame-inducing months he spent, while his father was in a debtor’s prison, as a 12-year-old “laboring hind” in a factory that bottled shoe-blacking.</p>
<p>Suddenly I understood why he wrote <em>Oliver Twist</em> and why it is so good. Budding writers are told <em>write what you know</em>. They should be told <em>write what you feel bad about</em>.</p>
<p>The work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Pennebaker" target="_blank">James Pennebaker</a> has shown the benefits  of even small amounts of self-disclosure. No doubt this is why all sorts of psychotherapy, supposedly based on enormously different theories, help roughly the same amount: All involve self-disclosure. I see this effect as something built into us by evolution  to increase self-disclosure. Talking about bad experiences helps your listeners avoid what happened to you. To motivate such disclosures, evolution has built into us something that causes us to feel better after we talk this way.</p>
<p>Scientists are not told <em>study what you know </em>and they are <strong>especially</strong> not told <em>study what you feel bad about</em>. Scientists are mostly men, of course, and that sort of thing makes men uncomfortable. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">My personal science</a>, however, suggests the correctness of this idea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Nathanael Nerode</h4>
<p>I have an inhalation allergy to polyester and acrylic dust that caused no end of trouble, especially nasal congestion. It took 20 years to figure out.</p>
<p>I live in Ithaca, NY. My nasal congestion started after a multi-month trip to China in 6th grade, in 1988. The air in Beijing was truly awful, and literally everyone had nasal congestion while there. But my congestion didn&#8217;t go away when I came back.</p>
<p>To figure out why it hadn&#8217;t gone away, a doctor (allergist) back in roughly 8th grade did prick tests. The &#8220;dust&#8221; test was said to use actual dust collected from houses. In retrospect, it presumably included polyester dust. It was the only prick test, other than the control histamine injection, to show an allergic response. The idiot doctor proceeded to claim that I had a dust mite allergy even though the &#8220;dust mite&#8221; prick test was negative. I told him <em>no, I didn&#8217;t</em>, and he should learn to read his test results. I asked what was in household dust other than skin, hair and mites. He somehow did not manage to come up with &#8220;fabric&#8221;. If I&#8217;d been bright enough to think of that then, I might have been able to figure this out much sooner.</p>
<p>In some ways my nasal congestion was quite bad. I got secondary sinus infections repeatedly, due to the airways never, ever clearing out. I carried Kleenex with me everywhere, and bought it by the case. I had to mop my nose a few times every hour. When I caught a cold, the frequency would increase to every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>The congestion lasted continuously through multiple living quarters at college and back in Ithaca &#8212; of course, at all those locations I had brought a full set of clothes, and had a typical polyester bed, and most had carpeting. It mysteriously cleared up once &#8212; during a trip to North Carolina. Only in retrospect did I realize that on the trip I was sleeping on a futon in a house with no carpeting, with nothing but cotton clothes.</p>
<p>The allergies were definitely triggered more indoors than outdoors and were worse in fall than spring. I quickly eliminated the possibility of detergents by repeated changes of detergent with no result. I was then stuck with no further ideas for 20 years.</p>
<p>After 20 years, I moved into a new house while bringing very little with me (only a couple of sets of clothes). Suddenly my allergies went away. I realized the cause was something in the old house but not the new house.</p>
<p>I could keep stuff at the old house, and I moved in really slowly, so I was able to do challenge-response experiments, with a multi-week test time for each.</p>
<p>I had had work done on the new house. I first eliminated wood dust, tile dust, drywall dust, and grout dust as possibilities, because they were all over the place while I was there. Then I moved in huge piles of books. Still no allergies.</p>
<p>Then I moved in my clothes. (Still no bed, latex futon.) My allergies came back instantly. I moved the clothes back out, sorted them by fabric, and waited four weeks for my symptoms to clear.</p>
<p>Then I moved the clothes back in one fabric at a time, with a two-week testing period to see whether symptoms developed for each. Luckily I was not allergic to the first thing I tried, which was cotton.</p>
<p>After finding the polyester allergy and moving the polyester out, I waited four weeks for symptoms to clear up before moving the next set in. Eventually I found the acrylic allergy too.</p>
<p>I also had to stop testing for a month or so at least three times when I caught colds, as determined by additional symptoms or by family and friends developing the same symptoms.</p>
<p>This took a long time &#8212; about a year &#8212; and is not a straightforward option for most people. I haven&#8217;t tested every fabric yet. I stopped after I got through all the common ones.</p>
<p>After I was &#8220;detoxed&#8221;, I started having a noticeable mild contact allergy to polyester and acrylic, which confirmed the conclusions. I think this wasn&#8217;t noticeable before due to constant exposure creating suppression of the response.</p>
<p>So I solved the problem from a combination of luck (moving into the new house showed that it wasn&#8217;t generic &#8220;dust&#8221;) and pure grinding testing, much like most science.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure many people would have the opportunity to test the way I did. I modeled what I did on the hardcore &#8220;challenge&#8221; protocol used for food allergies where you start with a very limited diet and &#8220;challenge&#8221; it with one thing at a time. How many people can do that with fabrics? You need a place to store the rest of your clothes. You may need to buy all-cotton socks or underwear or shirts or pants if you didn&#8217;t own any (luckily I did) &#8212; and you need to have no carpet and remove your BED from the house (which I had done anyway coincidentally).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://s919.photobucket.com/user/twoutopias/media/2i014-01-10berkeleyvsbeijingreactiontime_zps221e5bf7.jpeg.html" target="_blank"><img alt=" photo 2i014-01-10berkeleyvsbeijingreactiontime_zps221e5bf7.jpeg" src="http://i919.photobucket.com/albums/ad40/twoutopias/2i014-01-10berkeleyvsbeijingreactiontime_zps221e5bf7.jpeg" border="0" /></a> This graph shows my brain test reaction times over roughly one year. Each point is a different test; I usually do two tests per day back to back. I assume faster = better. In February 2013 I returned to Berkeley from Beijing. In August 2013 I went back to Beijing. When I returned to Berkeley, my scores got worse (slower). I was shocked. <em>Surely Berkeley is healthier than Beijing</em>. At first I thought it was jet lag, but the scores stayed worse long after that made sense. Then I thought it might be some difference in diet, even though I eat similar food in the two places. I tried to make my Berkeley diet closer to my Beijing diet. This might have helped. I noticed accidentally that chocolate improved my score and started eating chocolate frequently. This artificially reduced the difference since in Beijing I had not been eating chocolate. In Berkeley I started doing two things I hadn&#8217;t done in Beijing: alternate-day fasting and whole-body vibration. I don&#8217;t know if they made a difference. When I returned to Beijing in September, my scores got better, even though I was not eating chocolate. Eventually I improved my sleep in Beijing but that seemed to make little difference. The comparison is far from perfect &#8212; many things varied &#8212; but by and large my scores got worse when I went from Beijing to Berkeley and improved when I went from Berkeley to Beijing. </p>
<p>What might have caused this? There are a hundred possibilities but one stands out. In both places, I brew and drink several cups of tea every day. In Beijing, everyone, including me, drinks water from big plastic bottles that are delivered to your house. You can choose pure water or &#8220;mineral&#8221; water, which has  added magnesium and potassium. In Berkeley I use tap water (Brita filtered). I don&#8217;t think potassium affects brain function &#8212; for example, eating bananas makes no difference &#8212; but there is <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/testing-magnesium-s-brain-boosting-effects-1.11665" target="_blank">plenty of evidence that magnesium improves brain function</a>. In Beijing I had tested a magnesium supplement and found no effect, consistent with the idea that I was already getting enough. Magnesium is also believed to improve sleep. In Beijing I seemed to sleep better than in Berkeley. Again, this is consistent with a difference in magnesium levels (more in Beijing). If ordinary magnesium-enriched water improves brain function, it would be significant because it is so easy, in contrast to <a href="http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2012/feb2012_Novel-Magnesium-Compound-Reverses-Neurodegeneration_01.htm" target="_blank">other ways of increasing magnesium levels</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hsu, who has <a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">an excellent blog</a>, recently became Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies at Michigan State University. Before that, he was a professor of physics. At a dinner for faculty promoted to full professor, <a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2013/12/one-in-thousand.html" target="_blank">he said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When an attorney prepares a case it is for her client. When a Google engineer develops a new algorithm, it is for Google &#8212; for money. Fewer than one in a thousand individuals in our society has the privilege, the freedom, to pursue <i>their own</i> ideas and creations. The vast majority of such people are at research universities. A smaller number are at think tanks or national labs, but most are professors like yourselves. It is you who will make the future better than the past; who will bring new wonders into existence.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this blog, in thousands of posts, I have argued a much different view: <strong>everyone</strong> can make the future better than the past in the way Stephen is talking about, by adding to our understanding. In particular, anyone &#8212; not just professional researchers, such as professors at research universities &#8212; can increase our understanding of how to be healthy. This has already started to happen. Some examples:<span id="more-12894"></span></p>
<p>1. Stuart King (a musician) commented <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/11/association-of-sleep-and-chronic-illness/#comment-1150683" target="_blank">how much bedtime honey helped him sleep better</a>. Learning about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">this effect</a> is a big step forward in knowing how to be healthy &#8212; good sleep is at the center of good health. No professional researcher has come close to Stuart&#8217;s insight.</p>
<p>2. Katherine Reid (trained as a protein chemist but not a professor) discovered that if she removed all glutamate from her daughter&#8217;s diet, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/17/journal-of-personal-science-one-childs-autism-eliminated-by-removal-of-glutamate-from-her-diet/" target="_blank">her daughter&#8217;s autism disappeared.</a> This is more progress than any professional researcher has made. None of them has made even one case of autism disappear.</p>
<p>3. Many people told me about how various treatments they learned about from this blog have helped them &#8212; for example Vitamin D3 in the morning and bedtime honey. I recently posted <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/14/bedtime-honey-is-a-godsend/" target="_blank">a comment about bedtime honey</a>, for instance. These treatments are so new and surprising that these experiences are meaningful. They help others decide if these treatments should be taken seriously. (For anyone who dismisses these reports as &#8220;anecdotes&#8221;, I have one question: What have you discovered?)</p>
<p>4. I have used a brain tracking test to find out new things about how my environment affects my brain, including the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">benefits of butter</a> and the <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">bad effect of tofu</a>. At least a billion people &#8212; everyone in China, for starters &#8212; eat tofu regularly. You might think that such a popular food would have been extensively tested for safety but, shockingly, other research supports my conclusion that tofu is bad. Anyone can do the sort of tests I did. Let me repeat my offer to give my brain tracking R software (which only works under Windows) to others who want to use it. There is an associated <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114619130176100669530" target="_blank">Google Community</a> to join.</p>
<p>5. Although I am a professor, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">my self-experimental discoveries about sleep, mood and weight</a> were outside the area of my graduate school training (animal learning). For example, I am not a sleep expert. I made my discoveries without expensive equipment or university resources beyond the library &#8212; that is, I made them with resources to which almost anyone has access.</p>
<p>I am sure these examples are the beginning of something important. They are easy to explain. Who is better equipped to discover important stuff about health, professional researchers (e.g, professors) or non-professionals (the rest of us)? Although professional researchers have big advantages over the rest of us &#8212; this is the usual view &#8212; non-professionals have big advantages over professionals that few people seem aware of. Sometimes the non-professional advantages outweigh the professional advantages and the non-professionals get there first. For example, a professional autism researcher could have done what Reid did (measure the effect of removing all glutamate on autism), but Reid did it first.</p>
<p>The advantages of non-professionals over professionals, a topic I have discussed <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">many times</a>, include:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Ability to self-track and self-experiment</strong>. This is too humble for many professionals. In <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em>, Thorstein Veblen emphasized that professors like to show off via their work. This is a disaster for science, where small (low status) and fast is much more effective than big (high status) and slow &#8212; a lesson that few health scientists have learned.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Freedom</strong>. Non-professionals can study anything, consider any crazy idea, test any treatment. Professionals must be respectable. Institutional rules and committees also constrain them.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Time</strong>. Non-professionals can study any problem for as long as they want. Professionals must publish regularly.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Motivation</strong>. Because they study their own problems, non-professionals are highly motivated to find the truth. For example, no one cares more about the safety of your food than you do. Professionals usually study problems whose solution gives them no practical benefit. While non-professionals care only about their own health, professionals care a great deal about their career, which makes it <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/11/joseph-biederman-is-still-at-harvard/" target="_blank">quite a bit harder</a> to do the best thing for other people&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>5. <strong>IQ</strong> (which Stephen often blogs about). If you randomly select one professor who studies health, and compare him/her to a thousand randomly-selected non-professionals, the top IQs among the non-professionals will be much higher than the professor&#8217;s IQ.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/" target="_blank">keep writing about this</a> &#8212; hardly saying anything new &#8212; because it is so important, so non-intuitive (in almost every other area of knowledge, such as physics, only professionals make lasting contributions) and no one else says it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Bill Mitchell</h4>
<p>Chronic right-side sinusitis came as a shock in November 2008, at age 42. For weeks both sides (left and right) were blocked. I lost my sense of smell even after my left sinus cleared. An incapacitating headache lasted months. My right sinus was often totally blocked. I had previously been in very good health. I had never been to a hospital, never taken medication, no drugs, slender, athletic, normal blood sugar and pressure, no dental fillings, etc. Some hay fever, but no other allergies.</p>
<p>The breakthrough was finding out about baby shampoo. In less than a week of shampooing my nose, a six-month headache was gone. It recurred occasionally until I fixed environmental causes. I tried many things, but the two that mattered were replacing the household carpet and vacuuming my mattress every couple of weeks. A couple of years later, my sense of smell returned. When you regain a sense you thought was lost forever, you appreciate even the stinkiest odors!<span id="more-12757"></span></p>
<p>I found out about the use of baby shampoo to treat sinusitis from the website of a UCSD professor of medicine named Terence Davidson, who died recently. [Use of baby shampoo to treat sinusitis seems to have been recently <a href="http://www.omaha.com/article/20131204/LIVEWELL01/131209603/1685" target="_blank">rediscovered by an Omaha journalist</a> named Michah Mertes.] The website no longer exists, but is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090309103134/http://drdavidson.ucsd.edu/Portals/0/nasal.htm#Johnson" target="_blank">archived in the Wayback Machine</a>. The Wayback Machine shows that Dr. Davidson added mention of shampoo in summer of 2008, but by the summer of 2009 had removed it.  Why remove mention of the only treatment that seemed to matter?</p>
<p>Sinusitis treatment in the U.S. is doubly silly. First, nearly all chronic sinusitis is fungal (said the Mayo Clinic in 1999), yet antibiotics are universally prescribed, with no effect on the primary infection. Second, no one ever looks for environmental causes.</p>
<div><b>Things that didn&#8217;t help:</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Consulted five doctors:  family GP, two urgent care, one internist, one ENT [ear nose throat].  None explored environmental causes.</li>
<li>X-ray ordered by internist.  Found a blob in the right sinus;  ordered antibiotics, which had no effect.</li>
<li>Scoped by ENT doctor.  He viewed only the left sinus, because the right (the one with the problem) was too narrow to get the instrument in. Pronouncing the left side normal, he prescribed steroids, which had no effect.</li>
<li>Medications prescribed in various combinations by all five docs, to no avail:  antibiotics, Claritin, Sudafed, steroid inhalers, Nasonex, pain relievers.</li>
<li>In my home, I sprayed bleach solution onto a small patch of mold found under my bedroom carpet.</li>
<li>Replaced a leaky shower stall and mushy floorboards that had caused the mold.</li>
<li>Hired an environmental consultant to look for mold in HVAC system.  Found none.</li>
<li>Had all acoustic ceilings removed, as they had been raining fine dust.</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Things that helped slightly:</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Sinus rinse with saline alone. Has worked well for daily &#8220;maintenance,&#8221; but when trying fix the headache and closed sinus, was like chipping at an iceberg with an icepick.</li>
<li>Sinus rinse laced with topical antibiotic (obtained under prescription, at my request, from a doctor friend who saw no harm in it &#8212; purchased pre-mixed in saline solution, from a compounding pharmacy). Not obviously better than rinse alone.</li>
<li>Sinus rinse laced with topical antibiotics, administered with my head upside-down, and left to steep in the sinuses for 20 minutes. My idea here was to use the antibiotics in part to prevent the side effect of an ear infection, since some water might go into the ears when re-inverting. No ear infection, but not much sinus relief either.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><b>Things that obviously worked:</b></div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reading about and treating biofilms with surfactants. This was a breakthrough.
<ul>
<li>Shampoo-laced sinus rinse was the first real success.</li>
<li>Repeated shampoo rinse, at intervals of 30 to 60 minutes. My idea was to let the surfactant break things up, then wash again while everything was wet and loose. This was much more effective than just once a day.</li>
<li>Simplest setup: I use a Neilmed squeeze bottle and salt packets (avail in supermarkets), mixed with tap water. I use tap because I trust that our city water is clean and chlorinated. I do not use warm tap water, because water heaters are supposedly bacteria farms. I use almost a teaspoon of Johnson&#8217;s baby shampoo in 16 oz. of water. Using this much is painful &#8212; stings the nasal passage. Recently I learned that someone else gets the same relief, and no pain, using only a few drops of shampoo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Became more aware of a &#8220;sinus closing down&#8221; feeling. After a few months of relief, I could more keenly sense when my sinus would begin closing/inflaming/whatever, usually in response to dust exposure at home.  This feeling could be used as a signal to decide what to fix next. Examples:
<ul>
<li>When sinuses closed, e.g. while kicking up dust cleaning the garage, I tried putting on a HEPA-filtered painter&#8217;s mask (bought at Ace Hardware), to verify that sinuses promptly opened back up again. They did.</li>
<li>Purchased a highly-rated (per Consumer Reports) bagged vacuum cleaner. I suspect that cheap bagless vacuums (anything you buy at Target) silt up immediately, then simply blow dust around the house. So my sinus tells me.</li>
<li>Replaced the carpet, and vacuumed up the thick layer of dust beneath the carpet. Have not had a serious sinusitis recurrence since doing this.</li>
<li>Began vacuuming my  mattress every two weeks.  Probably should replace it:  even now, I can feel my right sinus start to close after a few weeks if I don&#8217;t vacuum it.</li>
<li>My sofa is a dust trap. I can feel it. Vacuuming doesn&#8217;t help &#8212; it&#8217;s on the replace-soon list, but I can afford to wait because things are under control now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><b>Possibly interesting endnotes:</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>At age 45, I got my first cavity.  Dentist said this was unheard of:  you either get cavities before age 25, or never.  Cavity immunity is hereditary;  neither my father nor his father ever had any;  my siblings have none, except for a few my brother got after radiation treatment for cancer.  My own unusual cavity occurred in the right maxillary first molar &#8212; a tooth whose root reaches up into my troubled right sinus. I mentioned to the dentist that it seemed interesting that this cavity, which he considered so unusual, should occur in the same location, at almost the same time, as the only other medical problem I&#8217;ve ever had. He said there was no connection, and, sounding a little bored, changed the subject.</li>
<li>My right nasolacrymal duct is now wider than before &#8212; air escapes from beneath my right eyelid when I sneeze. Seems benign. Amuse your friends, loads of laughs.</li>
<li>Warning on ear aches: nasal irrigation with too much pressure, or laying down on your side too soon after nasal irrigation, can let water drain into the middle ear, causing ear aches. I read the warnings and was careful, but still had this problem a few times. It was a small price to pay.</li>
<li>I tell other sinus sufferers how well this worked for me, but it&#8217;s hard to get anyone to try. Either they are grossed out by the process (understandable), or they have read the scare stories about fatal amoebic infections after sinus rinsing with bad tap water. These cases are extremely rare, and I believe all occurred when using untreated water in hot, humid climates. But the phrase &#8220;brain-eating amoeba&#8221; sure resonates &#8212; no one wants to try it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><b>Possible origins of my sinusitis:</b></div>
<ul>
<li>3-week visit to the Philippines a year earlier (no obvious infection).</li>
<li>1-week camping trip in the Sierras 6 months earlier (no obvious infection).</li>
<li>Exposure to smoke from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway_Complex_Fire" target="_blank">Freeway Complex Fire</a>, the 4th largest fire in Orange County history, which partially burned a landfill, i.e. potential random toxicity. The sinusitis and headaches began within days after the fire;  however, I was 10 miles downwind &#8212; pretty far.</li>
<li>1-month stay in someone else&#8217;s house in December 2008, where the central heater was later found to be leaking a trace amount of carbon monoxide. This was concurrent with the worst of the sinusitis, but it did not get better when I went back to my own home. My family stayed in the same house, with no ill effect.</li>
<li>In recent years, eating crappy batter-fried restaurant food increasingly causes strange nose/throat effects, such as wheezing and temporary sinus blockage. Fried chicken at Knott&#8217;s Berry Farm is the worst &#8212; instant shortness of breath. I can think of no reason this should happen, but there it is.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More</strong></p>
<p>Remember how baby shampoo disappeared from the UCSD prof&#8217;s website?  Something similar happened at NeilMed&#8217;s website, and the reason may be a nasty side effect. <a href="http://www.texassinuscenter.com/blog/11-07-11/neilmeds-sinusurf-additive-causes-loss-sense-smell" target="_blank">This post</a> says some people lost their sense of smell after using Neilmed&#8217;s surfactant additive. Neilmed makes my favorite sinus rinse product, which uses a squeeze bottle instead of gravity feed.  A few years ago they briefly began selling a surfactant additive, but then pulled it off the market, and now have only <a href="http://www.neilmed.com/ask/index.php?article&amp;qid=1608" target="_blank">an undated post</a> saying the re-release is 2 to 3 years away. Maybe risk of side effects is why the UCSD guy removed it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It isn&#8217;t well known that eggs (large amounts) can cause insomnia nor that caffeine &#8212; in special cases &#8212; can reduce insomnia. But a reader named Baeo Maltinsky recently made <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/11/sleep-summary-of-what-ive-learned/#comment-1163569" target="_blank">those discoveries</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back around July 2012, I was trying to improve my diet but I didn&#8217;t want to give up my vegetarianism, so I started to eat a LOT of eggs, usually in the range of 10 to 14 per day. Not long after, I started having awful insomnia. I could lie awake all night just unable to fall asleep. There were suddenly just too many thoughts buzzing through my head keeping me up. I assumed that it was a result of ketosis disturbing sleep. I tried reintroducing carbs, but when that didn&#8217;t work I gave up on dietary modifications. I started cycling through OTC sleep aids, but I developed tolerance to anticholinergics very quickly.</p>
<p>By October 2013, I was going crazy. I couldn&#8217;t sleep well. It was making me depressed and seriously impairing my academic performance. I was exhausted constantly, but then I noticed something. I slept better when I consumed a lot of caffeine in the morning. I noticed there was a clear dose dependent relationship between how much caffeine I consumed and how well I slept. I had a hunch that the caffeine was depleting my acetylcholine levels, serving a similar function as OTC anticholinergics like diphenhydramine and kava.</p>
<p>I wondered what would happen if I sharply reduced my intake of acetylcholine precursors. A lot of people advertise eggs as &#8220;choline packed&#8221;, so I cut back to less than 3 per day. Suddenly, I was sleeping much better. Now, it could be something else in the eggs (I&#8217;m not really attached to my choline hypothesis), but either way I feel confident blaming them for my sleep troubles. My insomnia returns whenever I start eating them again.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him why he hadn&#8217;t realized earlier that eating so many eggs was the problem. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just didn&#8217;t think there was anything special about the eggs. I googled around for it and the only things I could find were about ketosis induced insomnia, so it didn&#8217;t occur to me that eggs specifically were likely to be problematic. I tried consuming enough carbs to knock myself out of ketosis, but when that didn&#8217;t improve the situation, I just assumed that something else was going on aside from diet. Eggs seemed like the perfect food. Cheap, nutrient rich, paleo, easy to prepare, and compatible with my (then) vegetarianism. It would have been hard for me to find a suitable replacement, so while the idea of testing it probably occurred to me, performing the test itself wouldn&#8217;t be trivial and the results wouldn&#8217;t be actionable.</p>
<p>As it got worse, I tried treating it more aggressively with OTC sleep aids, and that worked well enough that I stopped worrying about it. I wasn&#8217;t sleeping great, but it was enough to get by. Eventually they stopped working, but not long after that I made the caffeine connection and decided to try removing eggs. It was easier to do at that point because I had given up on paleo and vegetarianism and could just substitute chicken and sprouted lentils, and I had a (probably<br />
incorrect) neurochemical explanation to support it. Moreover, it had become VERY difficult to eat the eggs. My body just didn&#8217;t want to consume them and I had to slowly force them down. Something seemed to know it was bad for me, but I wasn&#8217;t listening to the signs. My behavior was not at all rational, and believe me after I discovered eggs were the problem I was kicking myself for not trying it sooner.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him what he learned from this, apart from how to sleep better. He replied:</p>
<ol>
<li>Costly experiments sometimes need to be performed.</li>
<li>Sometimes your values are bad for your health.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t give up just because there&#8217;s no evidence to support a hypothesis.</li>
<li>Simple things can easily go unnoticed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are good lessons.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six years ago I started using a reaction-time (RT) test (a test where you press a key in response to something as fast as possible) to track my brain function. I took the test daily. It must use only a small part of the brain but I assumed that something that made me faster would probably improve overall brain function. Behind this belief, which I call <strong>better RT, better brain</strong>, were countless studies of brain anatomy and physiology, which had shown that neurons and glial cells all over the brain share many features. Cells in different parts of the brain are much more alike than different. More support for this assumption was that <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">certain doses of flaxseed oil improved both RT and other measures of brain function</a>, such as balance.</p>
<p>I also assumed that changes that improved RT would probably improve overall health &#8212; what I call the<strong> better RT, better body</strong> assumption. It was less plausible than the <strong>better RT, better brain </strong>assumption because the cells in different organs of the body differ so much. They have many similarities but also many differences. I believed it for two reasons. (a) Flaxseed oil not only improved several measures of brain function, it improved my gums, no doubt because it reduced inflammation. It had been far from obvious that improving gums was so easy or that flaxseed oil (in the right dosage) would do so. The assumption <strong>better RT, better body</strong> had made a surprising prediction, you could say, that turned out to be true. (b) The brain gets much the same blood as the rest of the body. (Not exactly the same, because of the blood-brain barrier.) In the same way, all plug-in electrical appliances use the same house current. Just as all appliances have been designed to work well with that current, all our organs should have been shaped by evolution to work well with same mix of nutrients. You can&#8217;t feed your brain differently than your heart.</p>
<p>When I discovered that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">butter improved RT</a>, the <strong>better RT, better body</strong> assumption made a second even more surprising prediction: Eating more butter improved my health. This contradicted the claims of all mainstream health experts, who say saturated fats cause heart disease. I stuck with my assumption &#8212; I still eat a lot of butter. The data I&#8217;ve seen since then has supported my conclusion. For example, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/28/new-heart-scan-results-good-news/" target="_blank">my Agatston score got better</a>, not worse, after a year of eating lots of butter. The Agatston score is currently <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health-pictures/the-single-best-predictor-of-a-heart-attack.aspx#/slide-1" target="_blank">the best predictor of heart disease</a>.</p>
<p>I recently found more support for the <strong>better RT, better body </strong>assumption. Several studies have found that RT is a good predictor of health (better RT, better health). Even more impressive, it is a better predictor than many of the predictors we already know of. The RT test used in these studies is close to the test I now use, which I developed independently. The RT test in these studies involves showing a digit (0-4), after which the subject presses one of five keys (labelled 0-4) as fast as possible. My current RT test is very similar but uses 7 digits instead of 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15660853" target="_blank">A 2005 study</a> looked at the oft-reported correlation between higher IQ and lower mortality. The IQs and RTs of about 900 persons were measured in 1988. Deaths until 2002 were noted. RT was associated with lower mortality, even after taking out associations with smoking, education and social class. RT and IQ are correlated (better RT, higher IQ). When the RT-death association was removed, IQ no longer predicted death. So RT does a good job of capturing whatever it is about IQ that predicts mortality.</p>
<p><a href="http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/7.-Reaction-time-and-established-risk-factors-for-total-and-cardiovascular-disease-mortality.pdf" target="_blank">A 2009 study</a> compared RT to more conventional health predictors (&#8220;risk factors&#8221;). About 7,000 subjects were followed from 1984 to 2005. RT in 1984 was a good predictor of all-cause mortality compared to classic risk factors. Smoking was by far the best predictor, followed by RT. RT was a better predictor than physical activity, blood pressure, a questionnaire measuring &#8220;psychological distress&#8221;, resting heart rate, waist/hip ratio, alcohol intake, and body mass index.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17846257" target="_blank">A third study</a>, based on the same subjects as the 2009 study, found that amount of <em>decline</em> (slowing) in RT (from one test to a second test seven years later) predicted death. People with more decline were more likely to die.</p>
<p>All this supports studying how your RT is controlled by your environment, especially what you eat. You have to choose wisely what to study. The point is not to be as fast as possible regardless of everything else. Lots of drugs (stimulants, such as caffeine) decrease RT for short periods of time. I doubt they improve health. (If they harm sleep, they probably worsen health.) What makes sense is to look for two things: 1. <strong>Poisons</strong>. Things that slow you down. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">I discovered that tofu did so</a>. I gave several reasons for thinking that tofu affects many people this way, not just me. Billions of people eat tofu, unaware of this possibility. 2. <strong>Deficiencies</strong>. Study things that are missing from your life now but were likely to be present when we evolved. It is quite plausible that our ancient ancestors ate more omega-3 (in fish, but also in flaxseed) and more animal fat (from big animals, but also in butter) than we do now. My data suggest omega-3 and animal fat are nutrients necessary for health whose importance mainstream nutrition researchers have not fully appreciated.</p>
<p>My RT data have shown me there&#8217;s a lot I didn&#8217;t/don&#8217;t know about how my food affects me. Maybe everyone can say that. Unlike almost anyone else, however, I can reduce my ignorance myself. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/">I don&#8217;t need to rely on experts</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One reason personal science is a good idea is it is simple and immediate (in the sense of near). You study one person, you do experiments (easier to interpret than surveys), you can easily repeat the experiment (so you are not confused by secular trends &#8212; big changes over time &#8212; and implausible statistical assumptions), you are aware of unusual events during the experiment (so you are less confused by anomalous results and outliers), you are close to the data collection (so you understand the limits and error rates of the measurements). These elements make good interpretation of your data much easier. Professional science generally lacks some of these elements. For example, the person who writes the paper may not have collected the data. This makes it harder to understand what the data mean.</p>
<p>I hear criticism of (professional) science more now than ten years ago. Lack of replicability, for example. What I rarely hear &#8212; actually, never &#8212; is how often science critics make big blunders. As far as I can tell, as often as those they criticize. This is not to say they are wrong &#8212; who knows. Just overstated.<br />
An example is <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/2/311.full#ref-7" target="_blank">a critique of salt and blood pressure studies</a> I read recently. Many people say salt raises blood pressure. The critique, by Michael Alderman, a professor of epidemiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said, <em>not so fast</em>. The title is: &#8220;Salt, blood pressure and health: a cautionary tale.&#8221; It&#8217;s a good review, with lots of interesting data, but the reviewer, at the same time he is criticizing others, makes a major blunder.</p>
<p>He describes a study in which people were placed on a low-salt diet. Their blood pressure was measured twice, before the diet (Time 1) and after they had been on the diet for quite a while (Time 2). Comparison of the two readings showed a wide range of changes. Some people&#8217;s blood pressure went up, some people&#8217;s blood pressure stayed the same, and some people&#8217;s blood pressure went down. Alderman called this result &#8220;enormous variation between individuals on the effect of salt on pressure&#8221;. Oh no! He assumes that if your blood pressure is different at Time 2 than Time 1, it was because of the change in dietary salt. There are dozens of possible reasons a person&#8217;s blood pressure might differ at the two times (leaving aside measurement error, another possibility). Dozens of things that affect blood pressure were not kept constant.</p>
<p>Had there been a second group that did not change their diet and was also measured at Time 1 and Time 2 &#8212; and had the subjects given the low-salt diet showed a larger spread of Time 2/Time 1 difference scores than the no-change group, then you could reasonably conclude that there was variation in the response to the low-salt diet. To conclude &#8220;enormous variation&#8221; you&#8217;d want to see an enormous increase in difference-score variability. But there was no second group.</p>
<p>This is not some small detail. Alderman actually believes there is great variation in response to salt reduction. It is the main point of his article. <i>Spy</i> magazine had a great column called Review of Reviewers. Such as book and movie reviewers. Unfortunately there is no such thing in science.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some especially notable results (most notable first).</p>
<h3>Other People&#8217;s</h3>
<p>1. <strong><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/05/honey-at-bedtime-improves-sleep/" target="_blank">Bedtime honey greatly improved sleep</a></strong>. Stuart King found this after many other things had failed to help him. He got the idea from <a href="http://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-top-6-ways-to-improve-your-sleep-using-food/" target="_blank">Dave Asprey</a>, who got it from <em><a href="http://www.livinghoney.biz/the-honey-revolution.html" target="_blank">The Honey Revolution</a></em> (2009) by Ron Kessenden and Mike McInnes, but Stuart made by far the best case that the effect was important and determined some boundary conditions (e.g., don&#8217;t eat a lot of sugar during the day). The improvement is so big and easy (honey tastes good) that it&#8217;s quite possible this is why evolution shaped us to enjoy sweets after dinner &#8212; to improve sleep. In the future, I believe, it will be understood that sugars (at the right times in the right amounts) are a necessary nutrient &#8212; exactly the opposite of what all nutrition experts, <a href="http://www.dietdoctor.com/lustig-the-number-one-talk-of-ahs11-now-online" target="_blank">including paleo ones</a> and Weston Price, say. When this stunning reversal will happen I don&#8217;t know &#8212; but no one will have foretold it more than Stuart.<span id="more-12464"></span></p>
<p>2. <strong><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/17/journal-of-personal-science-one-childs-autism-eliminated-by-removal-of-glutamate-from-her-diet/" target="_blank">Avoidance of glutamate cured autism</a></strong>. &#8220;Cure&#8221; is not too strong. <a href="http://unblindmymind.org/" target="_blank">Katherine Reid</a>, who has a Ph.D. in protein chemistry, realized that many many foods, including ultrapasteurized milk, contain glutamate. When all glutamate was removed from her daughter&#8217;s diet, her daughter, who had been autistic, became completely normal. The generality of this solution is unclear but to cure even one case of autism is more than anyone else has done.</p>
<p>3. <strong><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/12/journal-of-personal-science-xylitol-improves-lichen-planus-and-mouth-health/" target="_blank">Xylitol eliminated lichen planus</a></strong>. Evelyn M. found that if she swished xylitol around in her mouth several times/day, her lichen planus and overall gum health greatly improved. This effect is well-known in Scandinavia but barely known elsewhere. American dentists don&#8217;t know it, for example. I didn&#8217;t know it.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.astrocyte-design.com/self-experimentation/brain-tracking-caffeine/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Caffeine reduced reaction time</strong></a>. Alex Chernavsky wrote his own version of my brain tracking reaction-time test and found, in a well-designed experiment, that caffeine made him faster, at least for a few hours. What&#8217;s important here is the method, not the result: Alex&#8217;s success with a test that costs nothing and takes only a few minutes/day. His success brings closer the day that many people can do these tests. When non-experts realize they can study their own health in good experiments, the world will change.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Mine</span></h3>
<p>1. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/05/honey-at-bedtime-improves-sleep/" target="_blank"><strong>Bedtime honey greatly increased my strength</strong></a>. (More <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/30/sleep-and-bedtime-honey-more-about-strength-improvement/?preview=true" target="_blank">here</a> .) This convinced me that bedtime honey was something special, more than another way to improve sleep. (I also improved my sleep by <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/27/correlation-between-moon-phase-and-sleep-quality-supports-importance-of-dark-bedroom/" target="_blank">darkening my bedroom</a> &#8212; much less important.) Bedtime honey also seemed to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/14/bedtime-honey-other-benefits-besides-sleep-and-strength/" target="_blank">improve mood and motivation</a>. I have been trying to improve my sleep my whole adult life &#8212; this, I now see, is the secret. My discovery in the1990s that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">lots of standing improves my sleep</a> led to the daily one-legged standing that made the strength increase so clear.</p>
<p>2. <strong><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/25/frontlines-of-personal-science-confirmation/" target="_blank">A banana a few hours before bedtime (<em>in addition to</em> bedtime honey) improved my sleep even m</a>ore</strong>. <em>The Honey Prescription</em> says it&#8217;s been known for thousands of years that bedtime honey improves sleep, but no one seems to have noticed this, in spite of the importance of sleep. As Robb Wolf has said, &#8220;If someone sleeps well, you can&#8217;t kill them. If they sleep badly, you can&#8217;t keep them alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank"><strong>Tofu made me stupid</strong></a>. One 20 g piece of fermented tofu slowed me down for two days on a reaction-time test. Other evidence has suggested that tofu is bad for the brain, but I find this the most persuasive. It addition to what it says about tofu, it suggests the power of brain tracking to reveal important things few people know. (An earlier example involved <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">butter</a>.) Billions of people eat tofu often.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/percentile-feedback/" target="_blank"><strong>Percentile feedback helped me work</strong></a>. The version of percentile feedback I use now (an R program that tracks my work and compares how well I am doing today to the last 100 days) is an improvement, I like to think, over an earlier version. The biggest difference is the addition of weighting: doing a hard task for one hour counts more than doing an easy task for an hour (e.g., a factor of 1.5, so that 60 minutes counts as 90 minutes). I kept track of how much I worked for a whole year, the first time I&#8217;ve managed to do that. Here&#8217;s what happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://s919.photobucket.com/user/twoutopias/media/2013-12-30percentilefeedbackandworkdonein2013_zps4e0852df.jpeg.html" target="_blank"><img alt=" photo 2013-12-30percentilefeedbackandworkdonein2013_zps4e0852df.jpeg" src="http://i919.photobucket.com/albums/ad40/twoutopias/2013-12-30percentilefeedbackandworkdonein2013_zps4e0852df.jpeg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I think the lesson is that with the right push, I can slowly improve.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I posted <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/26/lessons-of-this-blog" target="_blank">Kristen Marcum&#8217;s list of general rules</a> she&#8217;d learned from this blog. (For example, &#8220;be skeptical of experts.&#8221;) Behind her list, I think there is one idea, slightly hidden from view:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>non-experts can discover important things about health</strong></p>
<p>By <em>non-experts</em> I mean people who are not health professionals. People who do not make a living from health research. By <em>discover </em>I mean <em>learn from data for the first time</em>, actually discover &#8212; in contrast to learn from an expert. By <em>important</em> I mean stuff that matters to many people. (It&#8217;s obvious that studying yourself you can help yourself.) I haven&#8217;t heard anyone else say this, although it isn&#8217;t far from the Quantified Self movement. </p>
<p>The first example of this rule was the work of Richard Bernstein, an engineer with diabetes. In the 1960s, he pioneered home blood glucose testing, now enormously important. Another example, I hope, is my work. I used self-tracking and self-experimentation to find <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">important new cause-effect relationships in several areas</a> &#8212; new ways to sleep better or lose weight, for example. I believe my conclusions will turn out be true for many people, not just me, because they fit well with research done with other people and animals. I&#8217;m a professional scientist, which obviously helped, but not a health researcher.<span id="more-12603"></span></p>
<p>Why is this rule true? I found it hard to explain even my discoveries. <a  href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">The first time</a> I tried, I didn&#8217;t do well. I did better <a  href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">the second time</a>.</p>
<p>I came to see that discoveries require several things &#8212; more precisely, rate of discovery is a product of several factors. Everyone sees that experts have several advantages over non-experts:</p>
<ol>
<li>more training (graduate school)</li>
<li>more resources (equipment, grants, space, assistants, journals, specialized libraries, and so on)</li>
<li>more hours per day (all working day)</li>
<li>more experience (their entire working life)</li>
</ol>
<p>What I&#8217;ve never seen pointed out is that non-experts have several advantages over experts:</p>
<ol>
<li>more time overall (with no pressure to publish, a non-expert can easily spend many years on one question)</li>
<li>more freedom (no pressure to follow a party line, obey your boss or be popular)</li>
<li>more motivation (non-experts want to improve their own health, or a loved one&#8217;s health; for health researchers it&#8217;s a job)</li>
<li>ability to self-track and self-experiment (this is too humble for experts)</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of my job, I was only slightly behind health experts in terms of their four advantages, and I was far ahead of them in terms of the four non-expert advantages. This explains why I discovered many things that experts had not managed to discover.</p>
<p>Once I had a reasonable understanding of what had happened, I saw there was no reason I should be the only one. As a professor, I had excellent library access, much better than most, but now, with the Internet, many people have comparable access to research. Supporting my prediction that I am not the only non-expert who can do this, I have found other non-experts who have made important discoveries. Tara Grant figured out that <a href="http://primalgirl.com/2011/11/01/nprimalgirl-sleep-issues-vitamin-d/" target="_blank">the time of day she takes Vitamin D made a big difference</a>. Professional researchers have not yet figured this out. Katie Reid found that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/17/journal-of-personal-science-one-childs-autism-eliminated-by-removal-of-glutamate-from-her-diet/" target="_blank">her autistic daughter completely recovered</a> &#8212; autism symptoms completely gone &#8212; when all glutamate was removed from her diet. Professional autism researchers haven&#8217;t managed to cure even one case of autism, as far as I know. Stuart King figured out that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/11/association-of-sleep-and-chronic-illness/#comment-1150683" target="_blank">a tablespoon of honey at bedtime greatly improved his sleep</a>. No sleep or nutrition researcher has realized this.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, my mother&#8217;s mother sent my mother newspaper clippings about computers, of which, at the time, there were only a few. <em>This is going to be important</em>, she said. Let me continue the tradition by telling you <em>this is going to be important.</em></p>
<p>When even a tiny fraction of non-experts become &#8220;health knowledge generators&#8221; (for lack of a better term) the world will change. Some of the reasons:</p>
<p>1. <strong>The IQ advantage</strong>. There are far more non-experts than health researchers. A factor of 100,000? Let&#8217;s say health researchers have <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/2006/03/iq-in-different-fields.html" target="_blank">an average IQ of 130</a>. If you take 100,000 non-experts (mean IQ = 100, standard deviation = 15) the top IQ among them will be about 165.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Trust and generalizability</strong>. When a health expert advises you to do Treatment X (e.g., surgery), what should you think? Can you (a) trust him and (b) is what he says true for you? Any reader of this blog knows that health experts routinely overstate benefits and understate costs of the treatment they are promoting. Even if they are telling the whole truth, their advice is based, at best, on several studies. Is what those studies found &#8212; studying animals, or at best, other humans &#8212; true for <strong>you</strong>? When you study yourself  &#8211; for example, carefully measuring the effect of a drug &#8212; error due to distortions and differences from the study population go to zero.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Good and bad chemicals</strong>. We encounter thousands of chemicals, many of recent origin. How we react to them &#8212; do they help or hurt? &#8212; is determined by our genome (billions of possibilities) and environmental history (countless possibilities). Any sort of expert testing will be woefully incomplete. The danger in assuming that a chemical safe for most people is safe for you is illustrated by a woman who found her almost constant migraines <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html" target="_blank">were caused by household cleaning products</a> and Katie Reid&#8217;s discovery that her daughter was very sensitive to glutamate (found in a large fraction of supermarket foods). That things claimed to be safe may be dangerous is illustrated by the Berkeley graduate student who became <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/20/teeth-clenching-can-release-mercury/" target="_blank">poisoned by mercury when he started grinding his teeth</a> and my discovery that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">fermented tofu made me stupid</a> for a few days. My experience with tofu and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">butter</a> shows how a non-expert can do better than simply accept what experts say. My brain tracking, which anyone could do, detected previously-unknown or -unclear costs and benefits.</p>
<p>Our economy runs on specialization. We buy cars from car specialists, for example. Long ago, professionals had a monopoly on knowledge. To learn math, you had to pay a math teacher. Then came cheap printing and mass literacy and mathematics books and libraries. The same knowledge became not just free but widely available. Then came the Internet and <em>Wikipedia</em> and Google &#8212; even more available. But all this time, the source of the knowledge, its creation, was restricted to professionals. Only professionals (or rich amateurs, like Darwin) could &#8220;make&#8221; (or &#8220;mine&#8221;) the knowledge. Now that will change.</p>
