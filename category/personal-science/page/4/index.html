					<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a funny thing,&#8221; Jane Jacobs told an interviewer in an interview I cannot find, &#8220;you can&#8217;t change something unless you love it.&#8221; (By &#8220;change&#8221; she meant improve.) She had seen that people who disliked cities gave poor advice about improving them and understood that it wasn&#8217;t just cities. To improve something, it isn&#8217;t enough to have a good idea. You also need to (a) pay close attention and (b) overcome obstacles. (a) and (b) aren&#8217;t easy. You are unlikely to do them without strong motivation, such as love. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/19/you-cant-change-something-unless-you-love-it-the-case-of-dr-gilmer-and-dr-gilmer/#more-10273" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<h4>by Katherine Reid</h4>
<p>I am a mother of five children. I live in Fremont, California. In 2009, my youngest child, who was three, was diagnosed with autism. The diagnosis came from her social and communication impairment and highly repetitive behavior. She did not play with other children. She had no imaginary play. She made no eye contact with anyone. She had no spontaneous language. She did not understand questions. Her language was restricted to repeating what she heard (echolalia). In other words, she didn’t use language to communicate. She could stack blocks for hours. She would line up toys and have a meltdown if you moved a toy out of line. Everything had to be according to her rules or she was in chaos. She had highly repetitive routines that would escalate into unrest or panic. For example, she would go to wash her hands, turn the water on, turn the water off, turn the water on, and so on. Each time through the routine she would get more upset that she couldn&#8217;t stop. These loop-like routines might last hours, typically ending because of exhaustion from crying. She also had episodes of absence (blank stares) that lasted 15-30 seconds.</p>
<p>My husband and I tried a number of popular therapies. We tried <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/treatment/applied-behavior-analysis-aba" target="_blank">Applied Behavioral Analysis</a> (ABA) for 3 months. She got worse; her loop-like routines occurred more frequently. We tried speech therapy for 6 months. It increased her vocabulary, but did not improve her communication in other ways. The third therapy we tried was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_integration_training" target="_blank">auditory integration training.</a> We did the full series twice, which took a total of 3 months. There was no improvement. Then she started going to a special-needs school, where each student is given an individualized program. At this point, she was 3.5 years old. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/17/journal-of-personal-science-one-childs-autism-eliminated-by-removal-of-glutamate-from-her-diet/#more-10417" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Wednesday, May 1st, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Recently <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/24/cheap-good-science/" target="_blank">I posted</a> that my work resembles the work of <a href="http://www.redhongyi.com/" target="_blank">the artist Hong Yi</a>. Her work shows that profitable beautiful art can be made from the cheapest materials; my work shows that non-trivial useful science can be done by anyone. A reader named David <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/24/cheap-good-science/#comment-1107993" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your work and discoveries, just like Hong&#8217;s, are very inspirational. . . . They send a message that every individual has the potential to contribute something to society even with no or limited budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>This hadn&#8217;t occurred to me. It should have. I could have made this point in talks, for example.  Beyond the obvious point, David was saying that the more your personal science could help others, the more likely you would be to do it. The prospect of helping yourself <strong>and</strong> others will surely be stronger motivation than the prospect of helping only yourself.</p>
<p>How can one person&#8217;s personal science help others? This doesn&#8217;t happen automatically, it has to be arranged. My <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/personal-science/journal-of-personal-science/" target="_blank"><em>Journal of Personal Science</em></a> and the <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/personal-science/make-yourself-healthy/" target="_blank">Make Yourself Healthy Meetup group</a> are two ways of facilitating this. What about other ways?</p>
<p>David&#8217;s comment made me think of another way: <strong>Acne Club</strong>, that is, a high school club for people with acne. The purpose of the club is to promote personal science about acne. Members of the club try to find the causes of their acne, partly by self-experimentation. They meet to share results and ideas (e.g., treatments to try, how to measure acne) and encourage each other. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12472346" target="_blank">The discovery of two groups of &#8220;primitive&#8221; people who have no acne</a> suggests that all acne has environmental causes. If a high school group could identify even <strong>one</strong> environmental cause, it would be a huge contribution to human well-being &#8212; especially the well-being of high-school students. I think this is quite possible.</p>
<p>I had acne as a teenager. If you start such a club, I would be happy to help you however I can. For example, I could give advice about measurement and experimental design and could publicize what you learn.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>At least in one case. A 23-year-old woman, who lives in Manchester UK and works as a typist, wrote me:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve recently been trying out a standing desk, partly due to reading the posts you made about them. For the past few weeks, I have been tending to stand instead of sit when at my laptop, normally for more than 3 hours a day.  I sit down when I get bored of standing and I walk around lots.</p>
<p>I was looking out for mental clarity effects but I&#8217;ve not seen a clear effect in that direction. What I did find surprising, though, is that my chronic but mild IBS symptoms have abated. I get heartburn/acid reflux regularly, and gut cramping, but since standing more these have all but stopped.  I think it&#8217;s because standing up puts less pressure on my stomach and gut and leaves them more opened up.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked how long she&#8217;d had the symptoms (heartburn/acid reflux, etc.): <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/27/standing-improves-ibs-symptoms/#more-10227" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>Last weekend I attended <a href="http://www.the-eg.com/" target="_blank">EG</a>, a TED-like conference in Monterey. One of the speakers, a woman named <a href="http://www.redhongyi.com/" target="_blank">Hong Yi</a>, made representational art from cheap materials  &#8211; a portrait from coffee-stained napkins, for example. The most stirring talks were by Matt Harding (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwe-pA6TaZk&amp;noredirect=1" target="_blank">dancing video</a>) and Jo Montgomery and Chuck Johnson (<a href="http://www.sancaseattle.org/" target="_blank">circus school</a>) but she, more than anyone else, seemed to have done something with big implications. Her art was attractive, profitable, very cheap, and diverse (many materials, many representational styles). If anyone else has ever done this, I don&#8217;t know about it. She is an architect in Shanghai and her art began because she was in China. At a wholesale supply store, she came across very cheap candles. She realized she could buy enough of them to make a picture with one candle = one pixel. I imagine people will be watching Harding&#8217;s video a hundred years from now and the underlying point of Montgomery and Johnson&#8217;s circus school will be valid forever, but both were enormous expensive unique efforts. Hong&#8217;s work was much easier and cost almost nothing. The benefit/cost ratio was very high and millions of people could do something like what she did.</p>
<p>I realized that my work resembled hers.  <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/24/cheap-good-science/#more-10277" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>As I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/10/first-make-yourself-healthy-meetup-april-24-wed/" target="_blank">blogged earlier</a>, I&#8217;ve started <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Make-Yourself-Healthy-Meetup-Group/" target="_blank">a Meetup group called Make Yourself Healthy</a>. It is about doing better than expert advice. Doing better than taking prescription drugs for a problem, for example. The first meeting is Wednesday, April 24, 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm, in the meeting room of the North Branch of the Berkeley Public Library (1170 The Alameda).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found ways to improve on expert advice. I&#8217;ve found new ways to lose weight, sleep better, and so on. More to the point, many other people have done this. I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/make-yourself-healthy/" target="_blank">wrote about some of them for Boing Boing</a>. The specific things they learned about how to be healthy &#8212; for example, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/05/17/restless-legs-syndro.html" target="_blank">Dennis Mangan&#8217;s discovery</a> (or confirmation of someone else&#8217;s discovery) that megadoses of niacin eliminated Restless Leg Syndrome &#8212; are not just important in isolation but also as part of a pattern: showing that such a thing is possible. Their solutions were vastly better than what their doctors recommended. This is counter-intuitive. We don&#8217;t see this in other areas of life. We don&#8217;t see amateurs building better cars than professionals, for example. But it&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>I believe two things about this:</p>
<p>1. <strong>The solutions will generalize</strong>. What Person X discoveres improves her health turn out to help with other problems. I started drinking flaxseed oil because it improved my balance. It turned out to improve my brain function measured in other ways. And it turned out to improve my gums. I don&#8217;t have lichen planus or geographic tongue, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/12/journal-of-personal-science-xylitol-improves-lichen-planus-and-mouth-health/" target="_blank">which xylitol can cure</a>, but I am taking xylitol because I believe (backed up by research) it reduces plaque.</p>
<p>2. <strong>The methods will generalize</strong> &#8212; what you do that finds a solution to Problem X is worth trying with other problems. With me, self-experimentation is an example. When studying my acne, self-experimentation showed how to better than my dermatologist&#8217;s advice. Later, it helped me improve my health on <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">other dimensions</a> (weight, mood, sleep, etc.).</p>
<p>The Make Yourself Healthy Meetup group can spread the solutions, the methods, and the   knowledge that such a thing is possible. It can encourage people to try to improve on expert advice and help them do so.</p>

					<p><b>Xylitol Improves Lichen Planus and Geographic Tongue</b></p>
<p><b>by Evelyn M., Westchester County, NY</b></p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>In my forties &#8212; I am now 75 &#8212; my gums started to bother me. Newly-returned to the United States from Iran, I searched for a good dentist. The first one told me to get a cap on a tooth with a small chip. That was no help. A colleague recommended a specialist in gum problems. The specialist advised &#8220;scaling,&#8221; which didn&#8217;t help. Then he said I was not cleaning my teeth well enough. He put a substance on my teeth to reveal incomplete cleaning and was flummoxed when he could find no evidence of bad brushing or flossing. I gave up trying to solve my gum problem. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/12/journal-of-personal-science-xylitol-improves-lichen-planus-and-mouth-health/#more-10058" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Wednesday, April 10th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Encouraged by the success of the Quantified Self Meetup group, I have started <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Make-Yourself-Healthy-Meetup-Group/" target="_blank">a Meetup group</a> called Make Yourself Healthy. It is about how non-experts &#8212; the rest of us &#8212; can improve on expert advice about health. The first meeting will be April 24 (Wed.) in the meeting room of the North Branch of the Berkeley Public Library, 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm.</p>
<p>The group is about solving your health problems yourself, before or after mainstream medicine fails to help or provides inferior solutions. Access to health information via the Internet makes this more and more possible; so does new technology, which make it easier to measure health problems.</p>
<p>The first important practitioner of Make Yourself Healthy was Richard Bernstein, a New York engineer with diabetes, who in the 1960s bought a new machine that could measure blood sugar with only a single drop of blood. Bernstein used it to measure his own blood sugar many times per day &#8212; in contrast to getting it measured once a month at a lab. What he learned from frequent measurements allowed him to stabilize his blood sugar level, which doctors&#8217; advice had never managed to. His health greatly improved. His promotion of what he had done led to the glucometers you can find in any drugstore. Nowadays diabetics take self-measurement for granted.</p>
<p>I have managed to improve my health in many non-standard ways. Acne, sleep, mood, weight, and brain function, especially. On the face of it, you might think: <em>He did a lot of self-experimentation and discovered cool stuff</em>. At first, that&#8217;s how it looked to me. I wrote a paper called &#8220;<a href="http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866" target="_blank">Self-experimentation as a source of new ideas</a>&#8220;.  But that&#8217;s misleading. Self-experimentation wasn&#8217;t new, it was ancient. Yet my discoveries were quite new &#8212; quite different from what people already believed. What really led to my successes was: 1. <strong>Better information</strong>. Before the Internet, I spent thousands of dollars on a UC Berkeley library service called BAKER, which photocopied journal articles that I requested by phone and delivered the copies to my campus mailbox. Xerox machines made this possible. 2. <strong>The prison of professional science</strong>. There are so many things that professional scientists (such as medical school professors) cannot do. There are so many ideas they cannot test. They have left a lot to be discovered and it turns out that non-scientists (such as me &#8212; I was not a sleep researcher, a mood researcher, etc.) can discover at least some of it. In other words, I wasn&#8217;t successful just because I did self-experimentation, I was successful because I did <strong>wise</strong> self-experimentation. I chose wisely what to do.</p>
<p>Behind this Meetup group is my belief that anyone who does this &#8212; tries to do better than expert advice &#8212; probably can teach and learn from other people trying to do the same thing, even if their health issue is different from yours.</p>
<p>If you are coming to this Meetup and have experience (successful or unsuccessful) trying to improve on expert health advice, and are willing to share your experience, please contact me.</p>

					<p>You have <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/diverticulitis/DS00070" target="_blank">diverticulitis</a> when &#8220;diverticula in your digestive tract become inflamed or infected. Diverticula are small, bulging pouches.&#8221; <a href="http://yelling-stop.blogspot.com/2010/08/diverticulitis-my-story.html" target="_blank">A man in his forties named Tuck</a> had a serious case:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my twenties I got really sick; lying in bed for 5 days, bleeding from the lower part of my digestive tract: not pretty. . . Delirious days later and ten pounds lighter and I was recovered, except for one problem: I had diarrhea for the subsequent 14 years. . . . Two years ago [2008] I passed out on the toilet on a ski weekend. The emergency room at Bennington Hospital [Vermont] told me it was a stomach flu.</p>
<p>Four weeks later I got cramps at work. I had to lie on the floor until it passed. Then I drove to my doctor&#8217;s office, and he told me that I had diverticulitis, and I had to go to the emergency room. I drove myself, and barely made it. I was in agony; I nearly passed out again while they were interviewing me to see if it was &#8220;serious&#8221;. . . . I had a perforated colon. . . . I spent the next four days in the pre-operative ward, so if it got worse they could cut me open immediately. I lost 10 pounds. Then I started bleeding, and I realized these were all the same symptoms that I had had 14 years before. My blood pressure got so low that the automated blood-pressure machine wouldn&#8217;t work . . .</p>
<p>I mentioned to all three of the doctors I saw that I had had constant diarrhea for the last 14 years, since the first attack, and they shrugged. They told me to eat more fiber, and whole wheat, even though that was what I had been eating for the last 20 years. So I avoided surgery, started eating salad with salad dressing (containing industrial seed oils) and lots of whole wheat. . . . But the more salad and whole wheat I ate, the worse it got. I couldn&#8217;t understand why. Finally had to have eight inches of my colon removed. The diarrhea continued, so obviously the cause remained.</p></blockquote>

				<small>Friday, March 29th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Many scientists say that science should be funded because it leads to economic growth. <em>Today&#8217;s discovery, tomorrow&#8217;s new product</em>, that sort of thing. It&#8217;s certainly plausible that more research will produce more growth.</p>
<p>Terence Kelley, a biochemist who was vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-economics-of-science" target="_blank">points out</a> that some facts do not support this argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two key pieces, one British, one American. The British one is very simple. The British agricultural and industrial revolutions took place in the 18th and 19th centuries in the complete absence of the government funding of science. It simply wasn&#8217;t government policy. The British government only started to fund science because of the Great War [World War I]. The funding has increased heavily ever since, and there has been absolutely no improvement in our underlying rate of economic growth.</p>
<p>But the really fascinating example is the States, because it&#8217;s so stunningly abrupt. Until 1940 it was American government policy not to fund science. Then, bang, the American government goes from funding something like $20 million of basic science to $3,000 million, over the space of 10 or 15 years. I mean, it&#8217;s an unbelievable increase, which continues all the way to the present day. And underlying rates of economic growth in the States simply do not change.</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe the connection between research and economic growth is complicated. Veblen was certainly right, &#8220;pure&#8221; (= useless) research is high-status, &#8220;applied&#8221; (= useful) research is low-status. In the long run, this is a good way to allocate effort because although almost all the &#8220;pure&#8221; research <em>is</em> useless, a tiny fraction is not. And that tiny fraction might never have been done if pure research weren&#8217;t high-status.</p>
<p>Yet <em>after</em> pure research turns up useful stuff, professional scientists have serious difficulty making something useful from it. Almost all of my discoveries, such as the Shangri-La Diet and the effect of morning faces on mood, relied heavily on pure research. Without the pure research, I couldn&#8217;t have made them. The &#8220;pure&#8221; discoveries I used were well-known yet professional scientists were unable to grasp how they could be turned into something useful. I was able to go further than them for three reasons: 1. I was willing to spend a long time (decades) on a one problem. Professional scientists can&#8217;t wait that long. 2. I was trying to find a useful solution. Professional scientists tend to think useful research is low-status, as I said. 3. Studying myself instead of other people made me much more sensitive to unexpected effects.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.insidetracker.com/" target="_blank">Inside Tracker</a> sells blood panels &#8212; for example, 20 things measured in your blood (e.g., hemoglobin, magnesium, Vitamin D). It was founded in 2009 in Boston, Mass., by Gil Blander, a biology Ph.D., and two other people. They started offering the service in late 2011. Their main customers are athletes (20% professional, 30% amateur) and many Quantified Selfer&#8217;s (20%). I recently interviewed Dr. Blander:</p>
<p><strong>What have you learned from the data you’ve collected?</strong></p>
<p>Around 60% of the population has low Vitamin D.[What's low Vitamin D?] As of today, if you look at the ranges of the diagnostic companies, they are saying that everything below 30 ng/ml is low Vitamin D. We are giving you your optimal zone based on age, gender, athletic activity and ethnicity.

					<p>We need personal science, I say, because professional scientists lack freedom and have goals (e.g., status) other than progress. <a href="http://www.independentscientist.com/" target="_blank">Art Robinson agrees</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most [professional scientists] are trapped,&#8221; [he said.] Trapped by government money. Filling out grant requests, politicking to be well-liked, serving on grant review boards, going to the meetings to be seen by others, will take half your time. The project itself had better be popular. &#8220;You&#8217;re only going to get the money for something that everyone has heard of and thinks is the coming thing,&#8221; he said. As for politically sensitive areas such as global warming, &#8220;your research had better come up with the results they want.&#8221; At private research institutions, where half the money may come from private endowments, the research is nonetheless still held hostage. &#8220;Professors in these [institutions] who are candid with you will say, Well, we can&#8217;t really do what we want here because half of our money comes from the government so we can&#8217;t afford to put it at risk.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He also agrees with me about the importance of hormesis.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, when he worked at the Linus Pauling Institute, Robinson did a mouse experiment that found at certain doses Vitamin C <strong>increased</strong> cancer. This was contrary to what Pauling had claimed, and he reacted badly. As Robinson tells it,</p>
<blockquote><p>Pauling responded to the unwelcome news by entering Robinson&#8217;s office one day and announcing that he had in his breast pocket some damaging personal information. He would overlook it, however, if Robinson were to resign all his positions and turn over his research. When Robinson refused, Pauling locked him out and kept the filing cabinets and computer tapes containing nine years&#8217; worth of research. They were never recovered. Pauling also told lab assistants to kill the 400 mice used for the experiments. Pauling&#8217;s later sworn testimony showed that the story about the damaging information was invented, while experiments by the Mayo Clinic conclusively proved that the theory about cancer and Vitamin C was wrong. . . . When he found himself locked out of his own office, Robinson sued Pauling for breach of contract, slander, and fraud. . . . The case was settled out of court with Pauling paying Robinson $575,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pauling wrote a book saying that large doses of Vitamin C shortened colds and another  book about Vitamin C and cancer. Long ago, I took large doses of Vitamin C when I got a cold. It was hard to tell if it helped. Later I tried zinc, which definitely helped. After I improved my sleep, however, </span><a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">I no longer got unpleasant colds</a>. I stopped taking zinc. For me, Pauling&#8217;s belief that megadoses of Vitamin C reduce colds was a dead end. (And <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1541262/pdf/clinexpimmunol00225-0180.pdf" target="_blank">dangerous</a>. It isn&#8217;t reassuring that Pauling&#8217;s wife, who took megadoses of Vitamin C for many years, died of stomach cancer.) Improving sleep isn&#8217;t hard, and I suspect a much better way to improve immune function than megadoses of Vitamin C.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/34433/title/Do-It-Yourself-Medicine/" target="_blank">A medium-length article in <em>The Scientist</em></a> describes patients with fatal diseases taking their treatment into their own hands. Here&#8217;s what happened with lithium and ALS:</p>
<blockquote><p>Humberto Macedo, an ALS patient in Brazil, started a Google Docs spreadsheet to track self-reported ALSFRS-R scores. And Karen Felzer, a research scientist on the US Geological Survey’s Earthquake Hazards team whose father had ALS, built a website to host the project. At 3 and 6 months, Felzer, who has a background in statistics (normally devoted to analyzing earthquake aftershocks), examined the data. Both times, she found no evidence that lithium slowed progression. By November 2008, when Felzer posted her second report on the project’s website, most patients had stopped taking the drug.</p></blockquote>
<p>Drug companies don&#8217;t like the new movement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Drug companies are understandably wary of any movement that could jeopardize their chances of success, including patient-initiated trials. Drug developers go to great lengths to control the variables in clinical trials, to optimize the dosing and the treatment window in order to reduce side effects while maximizing therapeutic gain, and to monitor patients’ health. If patients outside the clinical research system start taking experimental drugs on their own, the likelihood of something going wrong is greatly magnified. And if something does go wrong—something that may not have been caused by the drug at all—entire drug development programs could be shut down prematurely.</p></blockquote>
<p>The author of the article, Jef Akst, was impressed enough to start <a href="http://diymedicine.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">a blog about the subject</a>.</p>

					<p>Last week I had pizza at the home of my friends Bridget and Carl. It tasted divine. The crust was puffy, chewy and the right amount. The thin-crust bottom was slightly crunchy.  The tomato sauce had depth. The toppings (two kinds of mushrooms, Jerusalem artichokes, zucchini, onions, goat cheese) were tasty, creamy and a little crunchy. It was pretty and three-dimensional. It was easily the best pizza I&#8217;d ever had, the best home cooking I&#8217;d ever had, and much better than the lamb I&#8217;d had at Chez Panisse the night before, although the lamb was excellent. The pizza hadn&#8217;t been hard to make nor were the ingredients expensive. <em>Do other people wonder why this is so good? </em>I asked my friends.</p>
<p>At some level I knew why it was so good &#8212; why the sauce was so good, for example (see below). The puzzle &#8212; let me call it the Pizza Paradox &#8212; was that commercial pizza, even at fancy restaurants (such as Chez Panisse), is so much worse.  <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/03/13/the-pizza-paradox-home-cooking-and-personal-science/#more-9815" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
