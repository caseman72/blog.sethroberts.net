					<p>A Chinese friend of mine is a chemistry major.

					<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DcSO8gWB0Z0?feature=player_detailpage" height="250" width="450" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Recently the Berkeley City Council heard testimony about a proposed ban on mercury amalgam dental fillings. A young man named D&#8212; M&#8212;, shown in the video, told the Council that he had grown up in Berkeley and had gotten mercury amalgam fillings from local dentists. They did not tell him the fillings were dangerous. He attended Berkeley High, Harvard, and finally the clinical psychology program at UC Berkeley &#8212; which I know is extremely hard to get into, as he says. They accept about 1 in 500 applicants.</p>
<p>In 2007, three years into the program, he started clenching his teeth. He began to have problems resembling mercury poisoning, such as fatigue and poor concentration. He had to leave the psychology program. Hair tests showed large amounts of mercury. He did not eat unusual amounts of fish, so it&#8217;s likely that his fillings were the source of the mercury. By 2012, he could no longer work and pay rent.</p>
<p>I had no idea that teeth clenching and mercury fillings were so dangerous together. A few years ago, I found, to my surprise, that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/26/damage-due-to-mercury-revealed-by-brain-test/" target="_blank">removal of mercury fillings improved my score on the reaction time test I use to measure brain function</a>. At first, I had thought the improvement had other causes. Only when I tested these causes and found no supporting evidence did I look further and discover the improvement had started exactly when I got my fillings removed. After I discovered this, I looked around for other evidence that mercury fillings were dangerous. To my surprise (again), my evidence seemed more persuasive than anything I found. M&#8212;&#8217;s story is much scarier than mine and supports my conclusion that mercury fillings are dangerous.</p>
<p>Had M&#8212; been using my reaction-time test day after day, he might have discovered deterioration on that test before he noticed other problems. The test might have provided early warning. I hadn&#8217;t noticed problems with concentration or fatigue, yet when my fillings were removed I got better on my test. Had M&#8212; noticed the problem earlier, he might have figured out the cause earlier.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t monitor yourself as I do &#8212; and almost no one does &#8212; you are trusting your dentist, your doctor, your food providers, and so on, to be well-informed <em>and</em> truthful about the safety of their products. If the problems aren&#8217;t obvious, there is plenty of reason for them to put their hands over their eyes and say &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know&#8221; about problems with their products. Drug companies have often hidden the dangers of their products and surgeons have hidden the dangers of their procedures. Few people grasp that &#8220;evidence-based medicine&#8221;, with <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html" target="_blank">its disregard of bad side effects</a>, is biased in favor of doctors. (<a href="http://www.badscience.net/">Ben &#8220;Bad Science&#8221; Goldacre</a> is a prominent example of someone who fails to understand this.) If you monitor yourself you are less at the mercy of other people&#8217;s poor science, lies, and motivations that conflict with finding and telling the truth.</p>

				<small>Friday, September 13th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/paula_scher_gets_serious.html">a TED talk</a>, Paula Scher, a graphic designer, told how a hobby of painting maps turned into something like a job.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was up in my country house, and for some reason, I began painting these very big, very involved, laborious, complicated maps . . . They would take me about six months initially, but then I started getting faster at it. Here&#8217;s the United States. Every single city of the United States is on here. . . . One of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election that has the election results rolling around in the water. . . . Somebody . . . saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery, and I had a first show about two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintings that I&#8217;m showing you now. . . . They sold quickly, and became rather popular. . . . The gallery wanted me to have another show in two years, which meant that I really had to paint these paintings much faster than I had ever done them. . . . I was no longer at play. I was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show, which is not where I started.</p></blockquote>
<p>A hobby turned into a job. This has happened countless times &#8212; I believe <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">all jobs started as hobbies</a>.</p>
<p>One hobby that turned into a job is science. The first scientists were hobbyists &#8212; for example, Darwin and Mendel. The success of hobbyist scientists led to the creation of full-time jobs that included doing science &#8212; professors of science at universities. When science became a job, something was gained (professionals had more time per day, money, training, institutional support, collegial support, and prestige than hobbyists) and something was lost (professionals had less freedom than hobbyists). Professionals could do many things hobbyists could not, but the reverse was also true: hobbyists could do many things professionals could not. For example, they could work on a question for ten years without publishing anything (Mendel, Darwin) and entertain highly heretical ideas (Darwin). Professionals needed steady output and dared not offend, for fear of losing their job.</p>
<p><a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">My personal science</a> (personal science = using science to help yourself) is another step in this history. I combined the freedom of hobbyists with the knowledge, skills and resources of professionals. I can do whatever self-experiments I want and test whatever ideas I want. Yet I also have professional levels of training, knowledge, skill, and (to some extent) equipment provided by my job as a psychology professor, Berkeley library access, the Internet, free software, and cheap computers. To these two elements &#8212; the freedom of hobbyists, the resources of professionals &#8212; my personal science added a third element not found in hobbyist or professional science: the motivation of a person with a problem. I wanted better health. My personal science helped me get it. In the beginning, I wanted to sleep better, lose weight, have less acne, and be in a better mood. Later, I discovered new ways <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">to improve my brain function and blood sugar</a>. Just combining the freedom of hobbyists with the resources of professionals, personal science would probably be a big improvement. Adding better motivation suggests that personal science is even more likely to improve our lives by learning what professional scientists haven&#8217;t learned. The combination of professional science and personal science will be far more powerful (= more useful) than professional science alone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this in my own life, over and over, and I predict it will eventually be true for everyone. Learning how to control one&#8217;s own health &#8212; how to sleep well, for example &#8212; is non-trivial knowledge.</p>

				<small>Friday, August 30th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky" target="_blank">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>, I&#8217;m told, used to be a not-nice critic. The problem was his delivery: &#8220;blunt, harsh, not sufficiently tempered by praise for praiseworthy things&#8221; (Alicorn Finley). However, this changed about a year ago, when Anna Salamon and Alicorn Finley decided to try to train him to be nicer. Alicorn describes it like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me, Eliezer, Anna, and Michael Blume were all sitting in my and Michael&#8217;s room (where we lived two houses ago) working on, I think it was, a rationality kata [= way of doing things], and we were producing examples and critiquing each other.  Eliezer sometimes critiqued in a motivation-draining way, so we started offering him M&amp;Ms when he put things more nicely.  (We also claimed M&amp;Ms when we accomplished small increments of what we were working on.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Eliezer added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some updates on that story. M&amp;M&#8217;s didn&#8217;t work when I tried to reward myself with them later, and I suspect several key points:</p>
<p>1)  The smiles/approval from the (highly respected) friends feeding me the M&amp;Ms probably counted for more than the taste sensation.</p>
<p>2)  Being overweight, M&amp;Ms on their own would be associated with shame/guilt/horror/wishing I never had to eat again etc.</p>
<p>3)  Others have also reported food rewards not working.  One person says that food rewards worked for them after they ensured that they were hungry and could only eat via food rewards.</p>
<p>4)  I suspect that the basic reinforcement pattern will only work for me if I reward above-average performance or improvement in performance (positive slope) rather than trying to reward constant performance, because only this makes me feel that the reward is really &#8216;deserved&#8217;.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew Critch advises that &#8216;step zero&#8217; in this process is to make sure that you have good internal agreement on <strong>wanting</strong> the change before rewarding movements in the direction of the change</li>
<li>The Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR) has some experience learning to teach this.</li>
<li>CFAR has excellent workshops but not much published/online material.  A good mainstream book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Shoot-Dog-Teaching-Training/dp/1860542387" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Shoot the Dog</em></a> by Karen Pryor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this example because the change was long-lasting and important.</p>

					<p>Everyone knows that diabetes is associated with obesity, probably because obesity causes diabetes. However, thin people also become diabetic. A clue to why is provided by the correlation between diabetes and what are called &#8220;persistent organic pollutants&#8221; (POPs). POPs are man-made organic compounds, usually pesticides, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans.</p>
<p><a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/7/1638.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">A 2006 study</a> using NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2002) data found very strong associations between levels of these chemicals and diabetes. For example, a risk ratio of 30. These associations persisted even when the data was stratified in all sorts of ways. The scariest result came from people who had BMI &lt; 25. Looking only at such people, those above the 90th percentile for amount of POPs had 16 times the risk of diabetes as those below the 25th percentile. Here is something associated with thin people getting diabetes.</p>
<p>Does the association exist because POPs cause diabetes? You might argue that POP exposure is correlated with poverty (poor people are more exposed), poor people exercise less than rich people, and lack of exercise causes diabetes. However, Agent Orange exposure among soldiers is associated with diabetes. That is unlikely to be due to confounding with poverty or lack of exercise.</p>
<p>Everyone has these chemicals in their body, but almost no one knows how much. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m in the 10th percentile or the 90th percentile. If I&#8217;m in the 90th percentile, what can I do about it? A good place for self-measurement and tracking.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, July 31st, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.robinsonstudio.com/sites/default/files/imce/Sisyphus-for-web-2_0.jpg" alt="" />In third grade, I learned that Sisyphus was condemned to an eternity of pushing a rock up a hill, the rock rolls back down, he pushes it up again, and so on. Why the Greeks told this story I had no idea, and still don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I am now moving &#8212; from an apartment in the basement of a house to an apartment on the top floor of the same house. I&#8217;ve discovered that in small amounts this is enjoyable. I enjoy carrying stuff up a bunch of stairs. I could do it an hour per day forever &#8212; like Sisyphus, except with time off.</p>
<p>Here is the downside of the occupational specialization that distinguishes humans from other species. I don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to haul stuff upstairs one hour per day. People move stuff for a living. Instead I walk uphill on my treadmill, a imitation activity that does nothing for my upper body. I could move heavy stuff around my apartment, but that&#8217;s boring. The situation reminds me of the way Japanese schoolchildren clean up their school every day. In small amounts, cleaning is fun. Whoever runs Japanese schools has figured this out and used this fact to everyone&#8217;s benefit. Blogging is another example. In small amounts, writing and being read is fun. The communication this enables helps everyone. When writing becomes a job, a lot is lost &#8212; much less diversity of points of view. Those who write for a living are afraid of losing their jobs, reducing even further what can be said.</p>
<p>This blog is all about the fact that <em>science</em> is still another example. In small amounts, doing science is fun, especially when it has practical benefit (e.g., sleep better). Professional scientists have their place, just as professional movers, janitors, and writers have their place. But people who do science purely for their own ends &#8212; just as I move stuff upstairs purely for myself &#8212; have their place too. I am not as strong as a professional mover but I make up for it in dozens of ways. Personal scientists don&#8217;t have the resources (e.g., expensive equipment) of professional scientists, but they make up for it in dozens of ways. Without them, the diversity of ideas that are taken seriously (e.g., tested) goes way down.</p>

				<small>Monday, July 15th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/12/anesthesia-dolorosa-mirror-cure/" target="_blank">recently posted</a> about using a mirror to cure anesthesia dolorosa, a painful skin condition similar to phantom limb pain, whichi is always caused by surgery. Beth Taylor-Schott, the inventor of the technique, told me what&#8217;s happened since she last blogged about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since then, David is still pretty much pain free and off Neurontin. Just a twinge now and then that he takes care of with Lidocaine, if anything. Have not had to re-do the therapy or anything like that.</p>
<p>I have been contacted by two researchers in the UK, and as I understand it, they&#8217;re doing research based on the blog, though I have not heard what there results are. Also, someone in Australia wanted to fly us out to do a demonstration and be at a conference, but I couldn&#8217;t get enough time off work to make it worth it.</p>
<p>I have heard from people who have read the blog and who want to do the therapy and who have questions, which I always answer, but only a very few of them ever come back to tell me that it&#8217;s worked, and no one has ever come back to say it hasn&#8217;t, so I&#8217;m not sure what to do with that. I don&#8217;t really see this as my crusade. I put the blog out there, and I figure the people who are meant to find it will find it. We ourselves only discovered this through a weird series of coincidences, after all.</p></blockquote>
<p>She explained what she meant by &#8220;weird series of coincidences&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was by no means certain that I would read it. I think it had been sitting in my in-box for three or four months when I went back and read it. That is one coincidence. Another is that I came across it because, given that David had just flatlined twice in the hospital, I was in no shape to do anything BUT clean out my inbox, not something I did at all frequently at the time (like MAYBE once a year or every two years). And then too, I read it at a moment when his cardiologist had just told us that probably David needed to not only go off the stimulants he&#8217;d been taking to counteract the Neurontin, but also the Neurontin itself. His pain was being kept under control in the hospital with injections of Toradol, and there was no way they would let me give him that much when he was at home and not being monitored. So what would we have done if the mirror therapy hadn&#8217;t worked? He would not only have been non-functional, but in constant, excruciating pain. And yet I did not go into the inbox looking for answers, I went into it to distract myself from the fact that I seemingly had no answers. So the whole thing had a very <i>deus ex machina</i> quality to it.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the fact that I happen to be the kind of person who is resilient enough to actually try something like this despite years of frustration with the condition and our treatment at the hands of the experts. What are the chances that I&#8217;d be in a situation like this, especially given the rarity of David&#8217;s condition? (Last I heard, M, the woman in the piece by Gawande, did not pursue the therapy, even after it was suggested to her.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In a list of things that made the discovery less likely (e.g., rarely cleans out her inbox) she includes something that made the discovery much <strong>more</strong> likely, namely &#8220;what would we have done if the mirror therapy hadn&#8217;t worked?&#8221; She and her husband were incredibly motivated to make it work. More motivated than professional scientists ever are. This is an enormous advantage of personal science over professional science: the much greater motivation of the personal scientist.</p>

				<small>Saturday, July 13th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>For many years I have used the services of <a href="http://www.westcoasthealthservices.com/cm/Home.html" target="_blank">Heart Watch</a> to measure my cholesterol and other health-related things, such as HbA1c. The couple that runs Heart Watch, Sandy and Glen, travels up and down California. I was able to get tested only every three months. Feeling that this was inadequate, just as I did, a man named Karl Corbett recently started a business called <a href="http://myheartwatch.com/" target="_blank">My Heart Watch</a> that allows much more frequent tests in the Bay Area, at similar price. My Heart Watch uses the same portable testing devices as Heart Watch.</p>
<p>The Berkeley location is almost across the street from Whole Foods. I signed up online (I was the first person to use their online sign-up service), which was very convenient. </p>
<p>Corbett told me that he greatly improved his cholesterol numbers by changing to <a href="http://www.heartattackproof.com/" target="_blank">a Caldwell-Esselstyn &#8220;plant-based diet&#8221;</a> that included lots of vegetables, some fruit, no oils, and no animal-based products. (Since the usual oils, such olive and soybean oil, are plant-based, this is a curious feature. Esselstyn seems to ignore <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2144195" target="_blank">bad effects of cholesterol lowering</a>.) The more often you can test yourself, the more easily you can determine what controls what you&#8217;re measuring. When you can test yourself often enough to be sure whether a dietary (or other) change has made a difference, you can begin to ignore large clinical trials and their many limitations, which include poor choice of control group, poor statistics, incomplete reporting, biassed reporting, publication bias, confoundings, investigator fraud, on and on. They are the fool&#8217;s-gold standard. If I can determine if <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/02/does-alternate-day-fasting-lower-hba1c/" target="_blank">alternate-day fasting improves my HbA1c</a>, I can ignore what clinical trials say about it.</p>
<p>Before writing this post I spoke to Corbett about getting discounted testing in return for publicizing My Heart Watch. </p>

					<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia_dolorosa" target="_blank">Anesthesia Dolorosa</a> is a very rare condition in which part of the skin that is numb feels pain. It is a side effect of surgery for trigeminal neuralgia. &#8220;No effective medical therapy has yet been found,&#8221; says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia_dolorosa" target="_blank">the Wikipedia entry</a>. Whoever wrote that meant that no entirely effective therapy has been found. Some surgical treatments are helpful some of the time.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://anadmiracle.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">a series of blog posts</a>, an art historian named Beth Taylor-Schott wrote about using a mirror to eliminate her husband&#8217;s Anesthesia Dolorosa, which was on his face. She got the idea from a <em>New Yorker</em> article by Atul Gawande about V.S. Ramachandra&#8217;s use of mirror therapy to treat phantom limb pain. I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2009/11/17/gatekeeper-syndrome/" target="_blank">mentioned this years ago</a> but it is worth mentioning again as an example of non-medical-professionals finding a solution to a medical problem much better than anything professionals came up with. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/12/anesthesia-dolorosa-mirror-cure/#more-10928" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>Why does personal science matter? One reason, as I&#8217;ve said <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">many times</a>, is that personal scientists (who do science to help themselves) are free to speak the truth. Sometimes professional scientists (for whom science is a job) are not.</p>
<p>The history of human chromosome number is a good example. Starting in the 1920s, humans were said to have 48 chromosomes. In fact, the correct number is 46.  From the soon-to-be-published book <em>The Truth in Small Doses</em> by Clifton Leaf (copy sent me by publisher),  which is about cancer research, I learned that in 1955 two Swedish scientists, Tjio and Levan, established the correct number. After their article appeared,</p>
<blockquote><p>Several researchers wrote [them] to confess that they, too, had spied only forty-six chromosomes but had thrown out the results because they were in conflict with established knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In conflict with established knowledge&#8221; was euphemism for <em>we were worried what would happen to us.</em></p>
<p><em>The Truth in Small Doses </em>begins with this story. Leaf&#8217;s point is that cancer researchers have a similar problem: They too cannot tell the truth, which is that progress against cancer has been poor, in spite of billions of dollars spent on research.</p>

<p>I’ve been practicing meditation on and off for years. It doesn’t interest me in a spiritual sense; I do it because I think it improves my mental function. However, what I’ve read suggests there isn’t a lot of evidence to support that.  <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/08/journal-of-personal-science-effect-of-meditation-on-math-speed/#more-10861" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

<p>This graph shows my HbA1c values in recent years. After a lot of variation, they settled down to 5.8, which was the measurement a month ago. 5.8 isn&#8217;t terrible &#8212; below 6.0 is sometimes called &#8220;okay&#8221;) &#8212; but there is room for improvement. In <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908359" target="_blank">a large 2010 study</a>, average HbA1c was 5.5. The study suggested that a HbA1c of about 5.0 was ideal.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago I started alternate-day fasting (= eating much less than usual every other day) for entirely different reasons.  <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/02/does-alternate-day-fasting-lower-hba1c/#more-10789" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Sunday, June 30th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A few days ago, I gave a talk at a Quantified Self Meetup in San Francisco titled &#8220;Why is my blood sugar high?&#8221; (PowerPoint <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=10770" target="_blank">here</a> and <a "href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10760363/2013-06-26%20Why%20is%20My%20Blood%20Sugar%20High.pptx" target="_blank">here</a>). My main point was that alternate-day fasting (eating much less than usual every other day) quickly brought my fasting blood sugar level from the mid-90s to the low 80s, which is where I wanted it. I was unsure how to do this and had tried several things that hadn&#8217;t worked.</p>
<p>Not in the talk is an explanation of my results in terms of setpoint (blood sugar setpoint, not body fat setpoint). Your body tries to maintain a certain blood sugar level &#8212; that&#8217;s obvious. Not obvious at all is what controls the setpoint. This question is usually ignored &#8212; for example, in Wikipedia&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_regulation" target="_blank">blood sugar regulation</a> entry. Maybe Type 2 diabetes occurs because the blood sugar setpoint is too high. If we can find out what environmental events control the setpoint, we will be in a much better position to prevent and reverse Type 2 diabetes (as with obesity).</p>
<p>A few years ago, I discovered that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/" target="_blank">walking an hour per day improved my fasting blood sugar</a>. Does walking lower the setpoint? I didn&#8217;t ask this question, a curious omission from the author of <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>. If walking lowered the setpoint, walking every other day might have the same effect as walking every day.</p>
<p>I was pushed toward this line of thought because alternate-day fasting seems to lower the blood-sugar setpoint. After I started alternate-day fasting, it took about three days for my fasting blood sugar to reach a new lower level. After that, it was low every day, not just after fast days. My experience suggests that the blood-sugar setpoint depends on what your blood sugar is. When your blood sugar is high, the setpoint becomes higher; when your blood sugar is low, the setpoint becomes lower. Tim Lundeen had told me something similar to this.</p>
<p>If you tried to lower your fasting blood sugar and succeeded, I hope you will say in the comments how you did this. I tried three things that didn&#8217;t work: darker bedroom, Vitamin B supplement, and cinnamon. Eating low carb raises<strong> </strong>fasting blood sugar, <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2011/11/safe-starches-symposium-dr-ron-rosedale/" target="_blank">according to Paul Jaminet</a>.</p>

				<small>Friday, June 14th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Govind M., the Stanford student who wrote me about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/05/walking-and-learning-gre-words/" target="_blank">walking while studying</a>, has written again to say that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_noise" target="_blank">brown noise </a>(deeper than white noise) makes him &#8220;calm and focused&#8221;. He discovered this while trying to find something to listen to while doing schoolwork:</p>
<blockquote><p>I tried listening to rain, and that was ok. I know some people try to find places that are really, really quiet and then work there. But that&#8217;s pretty hard to do. Plus, it seems that the more silent the place, the more distracting individual noises potentially are. So one day I tried brown noise, because it was on the same site as the rain, and I was a fan immediately. I tried white and pink but I found them less calming and a bit too static-y. I use brown noise when I really need to focus. So any &#8220;serious&#8221; reading, writing, coding, studying, etc. I don&#8217;t know if there are contexts in which brown noise doesn&#8217;t help, but it does seem a bit much for responding to emails. . . . [It] makes the outside world melt away.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also helps him fall asleep. He uses headphones to listen to it. Unfortunately, he said, &#8220;everyone that I have told about this thinks I am crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried it and quickly became a fan. Brown noise is much more pleasant than white noise. I especially like the Getting Wet preset on <a href="http://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/rainNoiseGenerator.php" target="_blank">this page</a>, which is close to brown noise. It does help me focus. Putting on my noise-cancelling headphones and listening to this is like being instantly transported to a faraway peaceful place. A cabin in the woods. I use it when I am doing something that takes full attention. Unlike podcasts or books, it doesn&#8217;t interfere with writing. Unlike music, it never becomes boring. (The same piece of music over and over gets boring.) Why isn&#8217;t something like brown noise piped into waiting rooms, waiting areas, and elevators?</p>

					<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-09-Nick-Winter-work-on-Skritter-app.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10588" alt="2013-06-09 Nick Winter work on Skritter app" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-09-Nick-Winter-work-on-Skritter-app-591x300.jpeg" width="591" height="300" /></a><br />
How much did <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/percentile-feedback/" target="_blank">percentile feedback</a> help Nick Winter? In 2011, he wanted to finish coding a mobile app for <a href="http://www.skritter.com/home" target="_blank">Skritter</a>. This graph shows his daily work on that app. Each point is a different day. The lines are loess fits.</p>
<p>At first, he tried to work on the app but did not make it a priority. Then he made it a priority compared to other things he did. Then he set an explicit goal (a certain number of hours of work each day) and used <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/" target="_blank">Beeminder</a> to help reach that goal.</p>
<p>Finally he tried percentile feedback. It helped a lot. His work per day increased about 60% (to 8.6 hours/day) compared to the previous phase (5.5 hours/day). Using percentile feedback, he finished the app. During the launch, he worked on the app much less.</p>
<p>The data has several interesting features. One is the sudden improvement when percentile feedback started. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/05/01/percentile-feedback-and-productivity/" target="_blank">The same thing happened to me</a>. Another is that it helped him even though he was already making steady progress. A third is that the sudden improvement happened after he had been working on the task a long time (more than six months). Things become easier to do the more we do them but surely this change was complete by the time he started percentile feedback. Apparently it engaged a different source of motivation. Finally, he tried several things before he tried percentile feedback, implying that its value wasn&#8217;t obvious. It wasn&#8217;t obvious to me, either. I originally tried it to see what would happen. I didn&#8217;t have a strong belief it would work.</p>
<p>Above all, this graph shows it&#8217;s possible to learn from long-term self-measurement and what you learn may not be obvious. People who know little about research sometimes say that randomized double-blind trials are the only convincing way to learn something.</p>
