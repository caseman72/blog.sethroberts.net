					<p>Looking around for evidence connecting glutathione level and acne (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21896138" target="_blank">it has been proposed</a> that low glutathione causes acne), I found <a href="http://www.acne.org/messageboard/topic/307056-low-glutathione-may-be-a-cause-of-acne/" target="_blank">this at acne.org</a>, from a 20-year-old woman:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a personal choice research and viewing other people&#8217;s experiences with supplements is safer than taking my doctor&#8217;s advice. My doctor insisted I go on the pill, insisted I get on antibiotics [a common prescription for acne], insisted nothing was wrong with me and even did a hormonal test&#8230;said I was &#8220;healthy and normal&#8221; and to leave the office because my hormones were normal as well as everything from the liver onwards. I stared at him and told him he was wrong: 1. hormone tests will lie if I&#8217;m on the pill and 2. I have acne, never had it before in my life and it came about too fast &#8230; If acne is a symptom then something is wrong. I personally don&#8217;t trust doctors because they generalize [too much] and from personal experiences [where] I&#8217;ve been laughed at and dismissed and even told &#8220;leaky gut doesn&#8217;t exist&#8221;. Personal research goes a long way and it&#8217;s so great to have communities like this where everyone can help each other out.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is personal science in the sense of trying to learn from other people&#8217;s data. What&#8217;s interesting is that she says this. Nobody forced her to. She isn&#8217;t try to sell something or look good. Her discovery of the power of &#8220;research and viewing other people&#8217;s experiences&#8221; &#8212; better than trusting a doctor &#8212; (a) interests her and (b) she thinks will interest acne.org readers. Her own experience certainly supports what she says.</p>
<p>Long ago, it was discovered that the Earth is round. Before the discovery, nobody said that. After the discovery, people discussed it for a while (&#8220;Have you heard? The Earth is round.&#8221;), maybe a few hundred years. When knowledge of the Earth&#8217;s roundness became part of everyone&#8217;s belief system, people stopped discussing it. </p>
<p>In other words, this comment suggests that a new truth is coming into being. Her experience is the same as mine with regard to acne: Can&#8217;t trust what a doctor says. My dermatologist prescribed two medicines. Studying myself showed that only one of them worked, a possibility my dermatologist seemed to have never considered.</p>

					<p>Surely you have heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug" target="_blank">Norman Borlaug</a>, &#8220;Father of the Green Revolution&#8221;. He won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for</p>
<blockquote><p>the introduction of these high-yielding [wheat] varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India.</p></blockquote>
<p>He had a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics. He learned how to develop better strains in graduate school. He worked as an agricultural researcher in Mexico.</p>
<p>You have probably not heard of Henri de Laulanié, a French Jesuit priest who worked in Madagascar starting in the 1960s. He tried to help local farmers grow more rice. He had only an undergraduate degree in agriculture. In contrast to Borlaug, he tested simple variations that any farmer could afford. He found that <a href="http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/CIP_UPWARD_SRICase.pdf" target="_blank">four changes in traditional practices had a big effect</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>• Instead of planting seedlings 30-60 days old, tiny seedlings less than 15 days old were planted.<br />
• Instead of planting 3-5 or more seedlings in clumps, single seedlings were planted.<br />
• Instead of close, dense planting, with seed [densities] of 50-100 kg/ha, plants were set out carefully and gently in a square pattern, 25 x 25 cm or wider if the soil was very good; the seed [density] was reduced by 80-90% . . .<br />
• Instead of keeping rice paddies continuously flooded, only a minimum of water was applied daily to keep the soil moist, not always saturated; fields were allowed to dry out several times to the cracking point during the growing period, with much less total use of water.</p></blockquote>
<p>The effect of these changes was considerably more than Borlaug&#8217;s doubling of yield:</p>
<blockquote><p>The farmers around Ranomafana who used [these methods] in 1994-95 averaged over 8 t/ha, more than four times their previous yield, and some farmers reached 12 t/ha and one even got 14 t/ha. The next year and the following year, the average remained over 8 t/ha, and a few farmers even reached<br />
16 t/ha.</p></blockquote>
<p>The possibility of such enormous improvements had been overlooked by both farmers and researchers. They were achieved <strong>without</strong> damaging the environment with heavy fertilizer use, unlike Borlaug&#8217;s methods.</p>
<p>Henri de Laulanié was not a personal scientist but he resembled one. Like a personal scientist, he cared about only one thing (improving yield). Professional scientists have many goals (publication, promotion, respect of colleagues, grants, prizes, and so on) in addition to making the world a better place. Like a personal scientist, de Laulanié did small cheap experiments. Professional scientists rarely do small cheap experiments. (Many of them worship at the altar of large randomized trials.) Like a personal scientist, de Laulanié tested treatments available to everyone (e.g., butter). Professional scientists rarely do this. Like a personal scientist, he tried to find the optimal environment. In the area of health, professional scientists almost never do this, unless they are in a nutrition department or school of public health. Almost all research funding goes to the study of other things, such as molecular mechanisms and drugs.</p>
<p>Personal science matters because <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/03/02/how-to-encourage-personal-science/" target="_blank">personal scientists can do things professional scientists can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t do</a>. de Laulanié&#8217;s work shows what a big difference this can make.</p>

The results are so good <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/23/india-rice-revolution-questioned" target="_blank">they have been questioned by mainstream researchers</a>.</p>

				<small>Saturday, March 2nd, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I wonder how to encourage personal science (= science done to help yourself or a loved one, usually for health reasons). Please respond in the comments or by emailing me.</p>
<p>An obvious example of personal science is self-measurement (blood tests, acne, sleep, mood, whatever)  done to improve what you&#8217;re measuring. Science is more than data collection and the data need not come from you. You might study blogs and forums or the scientific literature to get ideas. Self-measurement and data analysis by non-professionals is much easier than ever before. Other people&#8217;s experience and the scientific literature are much more available than ever before. This makes personal science is far more promising than ever before.</p>
<p>Personal science has great promise for reasons that aren&#8217;t obvious. It seems to be a balancing act: Personal science has strengths and weakness, professional science has strengths and weaknesses.  I can say that personal scientists can do research much faster than professionals and are less burdened with conflicts of interest (personal scientists care only about finding a solution; professionals care about other things, including publication, grants, prizes, respect, and so on). A professional scientist might reply that professional scientists have more training and support. History overwhelming favors professional science &#8212; at least until you realize that Galileo, Darwin, Mendel, and Wegener (continental drift) were not professional scientists. (Galileo was a math professor.) There is very little personal science of any importance.</p>
<p>These arguments (balancing act, examination of history) miss something important. In a way, it <strong>isn&#8217;t</strong> a balancing act. Professional science and personal science do different things. In some ways history <strong>supports</strong> personal science. Let me give an example. I believe my most important discovery will turn out to be <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/morning-faces-therapy-resources/" target="_blank">the effect of morning faces on mood</a>. The basic idea that my findings support is that we have a mood control system that requires seeing faces in the morning to work properly. When the system is working properly, we have a circadian rhythm in mood (happy, eager, serene during the day, unhappy, reluctant, irritable at night). The strangest thing is that if you see faces in the morning (e.g, 7 am) they have no noticeable effect until 6 pm the same day. There is a kind of uncanny valley at work here. If you know little about mood research, this will seem unlikely but possible. If you are an average professional mood researcher, it will seem much worse: <strong>can&#8217;t possibly be true, total nonsense</strong>. If you know a lot about depression research, however, you will know that there is considerable supporting research (e.g., in many cases, depression gets better in the evening). It will still seem very unlikely, but not impossible. However, if you&#8217;re a professional scientist, <strong>it doesn&#8217;t matter what you think</strong>. You cannot study it. It is too strange to too many people, including your colleagues. You risk ridicule by studying it. If you&#8217;re a personal scientist, of course you can study it. You can study anything.</p>
<p>This illustrates a structural problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-28-personal-professional-science-in-plausibility-space.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9699" alt="2013-02-28 personal &amp; professional science in plausibility space" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-28-personal-professional-science-in-plausibility-space-591x300.jpeg" width="800" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This graph shows what personal and professional scientists can do. Ideas vary in plausibility from low to high; data gathering (e.g., experiments) varies in cost from low to high. Personal scientists can study ideas of any plausibility, but they have a relatively small budget. Professional scientists can spend much more &#8212; in fact, <strong>must </strong>spend much more. I suppose publishing a cheap experiment would be like wearing cheap clothes. Another limitation of professional scientists is that they can only study ideas of medium plausibility.  Ideas of low plausibility (such as my morning faces idea) are &#8220;crazy&#8221;. To take them seriously risks ridicule. Even if you don&#8217;t care what your colleagues think, there is the additional problem that a test of them is unlikely to pay off. You cannot publish results showing that a low-plausibility idea is wrong. Too obvious. In addition, professional scientists cannot study ideas of <strong>high </strong>plausibility. Again, the only publishable result would be that your test shows the idea is wrong. That is unlikely to happen. You cannot publish results that show that something that everybody already believes is true.</p>
<p>It is a bad idea for anyone &#8212; personal or professional scientist &#8212; to spend a lot of resources testing an idea of low or high plausibility. If the idea has low plausibility, the outcome is too likely to be &#8220;it&#8217;s wrong&#8221;. There are a vast number of low-plausibility ideas. No one can afford to spend a lot of money on one of them. Likewise, it&#8217;s a bad idea to spend a lot of resources testing an idea of high plausibility because the information value (information/dollar) of the test is likely to be low. If you&#8217;re going to spend a lot of money, you should do it only when both possible outcomes (true and false) are plausible.</p>
<p>This graph explains why health science has so badly stagnated &#8212; every year, the Nobel Prize in Medicine is given for something relatively trivial &#8212; and why personal science can make a big difference. Health science has stagnated because it is impossible for professionals to study ideas of low plausibility. Yet every new idea begins with low plausibility. The Shangri-La Diet is an example (Drink sugar water to lose weight? Are you <strong>crazy</strong>?). We need personal science to find plausible new ideas. We also need personal science at the other extreme (high plausibility) to customize what we know. Everyone has their quirks and differences. No matter how well-established a solution, it needs to be tailored to you in particular &#8212; to what you eat, when you work, where you live, and so on. Professional scientists won&#8217;t do that. My personal science started off with customization. I tested various acne drugs that my dermatologist prescribed. It turned out that one of them didn&#8217;t work. It worked in general, just not for me. As I did more and more personal science, I started to discover that certain low-plausibility ideas were true. I&#8217;d guess that 99.99% of professional scientists never discover that a low-plausibility idea is true. Whereas I&#8217;ve made several such discoveries.</p>
<p>Professional scientists need personal scientists to come up with new ideas plausible enough to be worth testing. The rest of us need personal scientists for the sake of our health. We need them to find new solutions and  customize existing ones.</p>

					<p>Mice &#8212; inbred to reduce genetic variation &#8212; are used as laboratory models of humans in hundreds of situations. Researchers assume there are big similarities between humans and one particular genetically-narrow species of mouse. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/02/07/1222878110.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">A new study</a>, however, found that the correlation between human genomic changes after various sorts of damage (&#8220;trauma&#8221;, burn, endotoxins in the blood, and so on) and mouse genomic changes was close to zero.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/science/testing-of-some-deadly-diseases-on-mice-mislead-report-says.html?_r=0" target="_blank">a <em>New York Times</em> article about the study</a>, the lack of correlation &#8220;helps explain why every one of nearly 150 drugs tested at huge expense in patients with sepsis [severe blood-borne infection] has failed. The drug tests all were based on studies in mice.&#8221;</p>
<p>This supports what I&#8217;ve said about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/02/16/web-browsers-black-swans-and-scientific-progress/" target="_blank">the conflict between job and science</a>. If your only goal is to find a better treatment for sepsis, after ten straight failures you&#8217;d start to question what you are doing. <em>Is there a better way?</em> you&#8217;d wonder. After twenty straight failures, you&#8217;d give up on mouse research and starting looking for a better way. However, if your goal is to do fundable research with mice &#8212; to keep your job &#8212; failures to generalize to humans are not a problem, at least in the short run. Failure to generalize actually helps you: It means more mouse research is needed.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m right about this, it explains why researchers in this area have racked up an astonishing record of about 150 failures in a row. (<a style="font-size: 13px" href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/colfootball/teams/worst.html" target="_blank">The worst college football team of all time</a> only lost 80 consecutive games.) Terrible for anyone with sepsis, but good for the careers of researchers who study sepsis in mice. &#8220;Back to the drawing board,&#8221; they tell funding agencies. Who are likewise poorly motivated to react to a long string of failures. They know how to fund mouse experiments. Funding other sorts of research would be harder.</p>
<p>In the comments on the <em>Times</em> article, some readers had trouble understanding that 10 failures in a role should have suggested something was wrong. One reader said, &#8220;If one had definitive, repeatable, proof that the [mouse model] approach wouldn&#8217;t work&#8230;..well, that&#8217;s one thing.&#8221; Not grasping that 150 failures in a row is <em>repeatable</em> in spades..</p>
<p>When this ground-breaking paper was submitted to <em>Science</em> and <em>Nature</em>, the two most prestigious journals, it was rejected. According to one of the authors, the reviewers usually said, &#8221;It has to be wrong. I don’t know why it is wrong, but it has to be wrong.” 150 consecutive failed drug studies suggest it is right.</p>
<p>As I said <a style="font-size: 13px" href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2009/04/23/trouble-in-mouse-animal-model-land/" target="_blank">four years ago</a> about similar problems,</p>
<blockquote><p>When an animal model fails, self-experimentation looks better. With self-experimentation you hope to generalize from one human to other humans, rather from one genetically-narrow group of mice to humans.</p></blockquote>

					<p>A month ago, I changed web browsers from Firefox to Chrome (which recently became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome" target="_blank">the most popular browser</a>). Firefox crashed too often (about once per day). Chrome crashes much less often (once per week?) presumably because it confines trouble caused by a bad tab to that tab. &#8221;Separate processes for each tab is EXACTLY what makes Chrome superior&#8221; to Firefox, says <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/12/08/04/200236/why-we-love-firefox-and-why-we-hate-it" target="_blank">a user</a>. This localization was part of Chrome&#8217;s original design (2008).</p>
<p>After a few weeks, I saw that crash rate was the only difference between the two browsers that mattered. After a crash, it takes a few minutes to recover. With both browsers, the &#8220;waiting time&#8221; distribution &#8212; the distribution of the time between when I try to reach a page (e.g., click on a link) and when I see it &#8212; is very long-tailed (very high kurtosis). Almost all pages load quickly (&lt; 2 seconds). A few load slowly (2-10 seconds). A tiny fraction (0.1%?) cause a crash (minutes). The Firefox and Chrome waiting-time distributions are essentially the same except that the Chrome distribution has a thinner tail. As Nassim Taleb says about situations that produce Black Swans, very rare events (in this case, the very long waiting times caused by crashes) matter more (in this case, contribute more to total annoyance) than all other events combined.</p>

					<p>A reader with an autistic son sent me a link to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/magazine/the-boy-with-a-thorn-in-his-joints.html?&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">a story in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em></a> by Susannah Meadows about a boy with arthritis who was cured by dietary changes, including omega-3 and probiotics. Conventional doctors and the boy&#8217;s father had resisted trying the dietary solution; Meadows is the boy&#8217;s mother.  An expert in the boy&#8217;s problem, Dr. Lisa Imundo, director of pediatric rheumatology at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, told Meadows that &#8220;she [Imundo] had treated thousands of kids with arthritis . . .  and diet changes did not work.&#8221; It took only six weeks of the dietary change to discover it did work. Eventually the boy&#8217;s arthritis was completely gone. It may have been caused by antibiotics he&#8217;d been given for pneumonia. The antibiotics may have killed his gut flora making his intestines too permeable.</p>
<p>Had Meadows accepted what mainstream doctors told her, her son would have taken medicine for the rest of his life &#8212; medicine that wasn&#8217;t working well. Dr. Imundo wanted to double the dose.</p>
<p>The reader with an autistic son explained how it related to this blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>It particularly supports the value of self-experimentation in these chronic conditions, especially when there is heterogeneity. The heterogeneity of autism was obvious to me from early on, although I&#8217;ve come to realize it&#8217;s not obvious to everyone else. Autisms of known genetic causes have different tracks (Fragile X is the best-studied). Broad studies of autism start with a huge disadvantage: they are studying different disorders of similar presentation, and what helps in one case may harm in another. After the steady drip drip of your talking about n=1 experiments, it dawned on me that this applied to our situation. You didn&#8217;t need to do a massive, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of acne medication any more than I needed to enroll a thousand families in a study of diet and autism. I could start with dinner.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reader found dietary n=1 experimentation with her son to be very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>. After I wrote this, Michelle Francl, a chemist who writes for for Slate&#8217;s Medical Examiner column, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/02/curing_chemophobia_don_t_buy_the_alternative_medicine_in_the_boy_with_a.html" target="_blank">complained about the &#8220;alternative medicine&#8221; in Meadow&#8217;s piece</a>. Francl fails to mention that dietary changes completely cured the problem, thus avoiding the need for dangerous drugs that weren&#8217;t working. Francl says that Meadows has &#8220;an irrational fear of chemicals&#8221;.</p>

					<p>I recently blogged about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/10/undisclosed-risks-of-common-treatments-why-doctors-terrify-me/" target="_blank">undisclosed risks of medical treatments</a>. For example, sleeping pills are associated with <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/11/dangerous-sleeping-pills/" target="_blank">a big increase in death rate</a>. Patients are rarely (never?) told this. One reason risks are undisclosed is ignorance: Your doctor doesn&#8217;t know about them. Another likely reason is that you and your doctor have different goals. If a treatment harms you, your doctor is not harmed, in all but a few cases. If you refuse a treatment (such as a surgery), your doctor may make less money. This pushes doctors to overstate benefits and understate costs.</p>
<p>This is the simplest case for personal science: You care more about your health than any expert ever will. The experts have advantages, too (such as more experience with your problem) so it is not obvious that personal science will be better than expert advice &#8212; you have to try it and find out. When I started to study my acne, I was stunned how easy it was to improve on what my dermatologist had told me.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, January 9th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>Brain tracking &#8212; frequent measurement of how well your brain is working &#8212; will become common, I believe, because brain function is important and because the brain is more sensitive to the environment (especially food) than the rest of the body. You will find it easier to decide what to eat if you measure your brain than if you measure other parts of your body. For example, I have used it to decide how much flaxseed and butter to eat. I have used R and the methodological wisdom of cognitive psychologists to make brain tracking tests. Alex Chernavsky, who lives in upstate New York, recently tried the most recent version:<br />
</em></p>
<p>In August, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/08/28/want-to-track-your-brain-function/" target="_blank">Seth solicited readers</a> to help him test a new brain-tracking program. I said I was interested.  I had a number of reasons for volunteering:</p>
<ul>
<li>My job involves working a lot with computers, so I thought I had a decent shot at ferreting out any bugs or usability issues.</li>
<li>I have been <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">tracking my weight daily for over eleven years</a>, so I was confident that I would have enough motivation to do the test on a regular basis.</li>
<li>I have a long-standing interest in neuroscience, so I was eager to help advance the field, even if in a very small way.</li>
<li>I’m in my late 40s, and I’ve noticed a distinct increase in my forgetfulness.   There are probably other, less-noticeable decreases in my cognitive function.  Thus I have an interest in finding ways to boost the performance of my brain.  Hacking brain function is obviously much easier if you can assay it via a quick, reliable proxy (i.e., reaction time).</li>
</ul>
<p>The program itself was relatively easy to set up.  The code is written in a free, open-source scripting language called R, so you have to install R on your Windows computer in order to run the program.  Upon downloading the script (which is contained within an R workspace), you have to edit a function to specify the Windows folder that contains the workspace file.  After that, you’re ready to go.</p>
<p>The three-month pilot study did not involve testing any hypotheses with regard to the effectiveness of interventions (for example, measuring reaction times before and after flaxseed oil).  My task was simply to perform the test once or twice a day.</p>
<p>Taking the test involves hitting a number key (2 through 8, inclusive) to match a random target number that is displayed on the screen.  The program measures the latency of your response.  If you hit the wrong key, the program forces you to repeat the same trial until you press the right key.  Reaction-times from these “correction trials” are not used in any subsequent data analysis.  A session consists of 32 individual trials and takes about four minutes to complete.</p>
<p>I performed the test daily for three months, although I did miss two days.  The test stopped short of being fun, but it was certainly not onerous.  The biggest hassle was having to wait for my laptop to boot into Windows.  If I had to do the pilot study over again, I would install R on both my home and my work desktop computers, so I could perform the test more easily (perhaps as a way to take a short break from whatever other task I happened to be working on).</p>
<p>The original plan was for me to email the R workspace to Seth once a week or so.  However, I suggested to Seth that we could improve efficiency by using a shared DropBox folder.  He agreed, and that is the method we adopted. Using this system, Seth had ongoing access to the latest data, and he could also easily make any bug-fixes or other edits that would take effect the next time I ran the script.</p>
<p>I did identify one bug in the script.  After each trial, the script briefly displays some feedback in the form of your reaction-time (in milliseconds) for that trial, your cumulative average for that session, and a percentile figure that compares your latest speed with past trials for that same target key.  I noticed that the percentile scores didn’t seem to make sense for some of the keys.  Seth examined his code and agreed that this was indeed a bug.  He made some adjustments and the bug was fixed.</p>
<p>I found that over time, as expected, my scores improved substantially.  They seemed to plateau after six weeks.  However, my accuracy suffered.  During the third month of the pilot study, I made a conscious effort to reduce my error rate.  I had some success, but I also found myself frustrated by my inability to reduce the errors as much as I would have liked.  Making errors, despite my best efforts, was the only  vexing part of taking the test.</p>

					<p>To do personal science well, what should you learn?</p>
<p>Professional scientists learn how to do science mostly in graduate school, mostly by imitation, although they might take a statistics class. Personal scientists rarely have anyone to imitate, so have more need to understand basic principles. There are five skills/dimensions that matter.

					<p>I have recently encountered three examples that suggest low-carb diets don&#8217;t work well long-term:</p>
<p>1. Alex Chernavsky <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">tried a low-carb diet in 2002</a>. Starting at 270 pounds, he lost 70 pounds. A year later, he started to rapidly regain the lost weight. He stopped the diet.</p>
<p>2. A &#8220;medical professional&#8221; <a href="http://www.livinlowcarbdiscussion.com/showthread.php?tid=9606" target="_blank">started at about 260 pounds</a> (she&#8217;s 5&#8217;3&#8243;).  After reading <em>Wheat Belly,</em> she gave up wheat. &#8220;After several months of being wheat free I lost 10 lbs. But that&#8217;s where it stopped.&#8221; Then she did  full low-carb. &#8220;From May to July I did what basically was Atkins induction. I lost 20 lbs but then the weight loss stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/" target="_blank">Jimmy Moore</a> lost a lot of weight eating low-carb. Starting in 2004 at 410 pounds, he lost 180 pounds. Then he gained half of it back, ending up near 300 pounds in early 2012.  <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/12/22/shangri-la-in-disguise-jimmy-moores-ketosis-diet/#more-8463" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>The first evidence linking exercise and health was a study of London bus workers in the 1950s. The drivers, who sat all day, had more heart attacks than the ticket takers on the same buses, who were on their feet all day. It was a huge advance &#8212; evidence, as opposed to speculation. The results were taken countless times to imply that exercise reduces heart attacks but epidemiologists understood there were dozens of differences between the two jobs. For example, driving is more stressful than ticket taking. Maybe stress causes heart attacks.</p>
<p>The first time I learned about this study, I focussed on two differences. The ticket takers were more exposed to morning sunlight (on the top deck of double-decker buses) and they were on their feet much more. Maybe both of those things &#8212; morning sunlight exposure and standing a lot &#8212; improve sleep. Maybe better sleep reduces heart attacks. The London data were not consistent with the claims of aerobic exercise advocates because the ticket takers did nothing resembling aerobic exercise.</p>
<p>Later<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/"> I discovered that walking an hour/day normalized my fasting blood sugar levels</a> &#8212; another effect of &#8220;exercise&#8221; (but not aerobic exercise). I had data from only one person (myself), but it was experimental data. The treatment difference between the two sets of data being compared (no walking versus walking) was much sharper, in contrast to most epidemiology. I am sure the correlation reflects cause and effect: Walking roughly an hour/day normalized my blood sugar. This wasn&#8217;t obvious. The first thing I tried to lower my fasting blood sugar levels was a low-carb diet, which didn&#8217;t work. I discovered the effect of long walks by accident.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22890825">A recent meta-analysis</a> combined several surveys that measured the correlation of how much you sit with other health measures. The clearest correlation was with diabetes: People who sit more are more likely to get diabetes. Comparing the two extremes (most sitting with most standing), there was a doubling of risk. Because people who stand more walk more, this supports my self-experimental findings.</p>
<p>I found pure standing (no walking), or leisurely (on-off) walking, did not lower fasting blood sugar (which I measured in the morning). After I noticed that walking an hour lowered blood sugar, I tried slacking off: wandering through a store or a mall for an hour. This did not lower fasting blood sugar. I concluded it had to be close-to-nonstop walking. Someday epidemiologists will measure activity more precisely &#8212; with Fitbits, for example. I predict the potent part of standing will turn out to be continuous walking. Long before that, you can see for yourself.</p>

<p>Two years ago I taped a bunch of Chinese flash cards (Chinese character on one side, English meaning on the other) to my living room wall (shown above). <em>I&#8217;ll study them in off moments</em>, I thought. I didn&#8217;t. It was embarrassing when guests pointed to a card and said, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; But not embarrassing enough.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I can&#8217;t remember why, I decided to test myself: <em>how many do I know?</em> About 20%. <em>I&#8217;ll try to learn more</em>, I thought. I was astonished how fast I learned the rest. It took little time and almost no effort. I didn&#8217;t need &#8220;study sessions&#8221;. I glanced at the array now and then, looked for cards I didn&#8217;t know yet, and flipped them to find out the answer. After a few days I knew all of them. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/11/22/the-physical-spacing-effect-new-way-to-learn-chinese-works-shockingly-well/#more-8099" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>What surprised me most about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=7671" target="_blank">my self-experimental discoveries</a> was that they were outside my area of expertise (animal learning). I discovered how to sleep better but I&#8217;m not a sleep researcher. I discovered <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/morning-faces-therapy-resources/" target="_blank">how to improve my mood</a> but I&#8217;m not a mood researcher. I discovered that flaxseed oil improved brain function but I&#8217;m not a nutrition researcher. And so on. This is <strong></strong>not supposed to happen. Chemistry professors are not supposed to advance physics.  Long ago, this rule was broken. Mendel was not a biologist, Wegener (continental drift) was not a geologist. It hasn&#8217;t been broken in the last 100 years. As knowledge increases, the &#8220;gains due to specialization&#8221; &#8212; the advantage of specialists over everyone else within their area of expertise &#8212; is supposed to increase. The advantage, and its growth, seem inevitable. It occurs, say economists, because specialized knowledge (e.g., what physicists know that the rest of us, including chemists, don&#8217;t know) increases. <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">My theory of human evolution</a> centers on the idea that humans have evolved to specialize and trade. In my life I use thousands of things made by specialists that <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html" target="_blank">I couldn&#8217;t begin to make myself</a>.</p>
<p>Here we have two things. 1. A general rule (specialists have a big advantage, within their specialty, over the rest of us) that is overwhelmingly true. 2. An exception (my work). How can this be explained? What can we learn from it? I&#8217;ve <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">tried to answer these questions</a> but I can add to what I said in that paper. The power of specialization is clearly enormous. Adam Smith, who called specialization &#8220;division of labor&#8221;, was right. The existence of an exception to the general rule suggests  there are forces pushing in the opposite direction (toward specialists being <strong>worse</strong> than the rest of us in their area of expertise) that can be more powerful than the power of specialization. Given the power of specialization, the countervailing forces must be remarkably strong. Can we learn more about them? Can we harness them? Can we increase them? The power of specialization has been increasing for thousands of years. How strong the countervailing forces may become is unclear.</p>
<p>The more you&#8217;ve read this blog, the more you know what I think the countervailing forces are. Some of them weaken specialists: 1. Professors prefer to be useless rather than useful (Veblen).  2. A large fraction (99%?) of health care workers have no interest in remedies that do not allow them to make money. 3. Medical school professors are terrible scientists. 4. Restrictions on research. Some of them strengthen the rest of us: 1. Data storage and analysis have become very cheap. 2. It is easier for non-scientists to read the scientific literature. 3. No one cares more about your health than you. These are examples. The list could be much longer. What&#8217;s interesting is not the critique of health care, which is pretty obvious, but the apparent power of these forces, which isn&#8217;t obvious at all.</p>
<p>I want to learn more about this. I want learn how to use these opposing forces and, if possible, increase them. One way to do this is find more exceptions to the general rule, that is, find more people who have improved their health beyond expert advice. I have <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/make-yourself-healthy/" target="_blank">found some examples</a>. To find more, to learn more about them, and to encourage this sort of thing (DIY Health), I offer the opportunity to guest-blog here.</p>
<p>I think the fundamental reason you can improve on what health experts tell you is that you can gather data. Health experts have weakened their position by ignoring vast amounts of data. Three kinds of data are helpful:  (a) other people&#8217;s experiences, (b) scientific papers and (c) self-measurement (combined with self-experimentation). No doubt (c) is the hardest to collect and the most powerful. I would like to offer one or more people the opportunity to guest-blog here about what happens when they try to do (c). In plain English, I am looking for people who are measuring a health problem  and trying to improve on expert advice. For example, trying to lower blood pressure without taking blood pressure medicine. Or counting pimples to figure out what&#8217;s causing your acne. Or measuring your mood to test alternatives to anti-depressants. I don&#8217;t care what&#8217;s measured, so long as it is health-related. (Exception: no weight-loss stories) and you approach these measurements with an open mind (e.g., not trying to promote some product or theory). I am not trying to collect success stories. I am trying to find out what happens when people take this approach.</p>
<p>Guest-blogging may increase your motivation, push you to think more (&#8220;<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/22/is-it-time-to-revise-ancient-philosophical-questions/" target="_blank">I blog, therefore I think</a>&#8220;) and give you access to the collective wisdom of readers of this blog (in the comments). If guest-blogging about your experiences and progress (or lack of it) might interest you, contact me with details of what you are doing or plan to do.</p>

					<p><em>If someone sleeps well, it&#8217;s tough to kill them. If someone does not sleep well, it&#8217;s tough to keep them alive.</em> Robb Wolf quoted someone to this effect at the last Ancestral Health Symposium. One reason it&#8217;s plausible is <a href="http://ccn.aacnjournals.org/content/32/2/e19.long">better sleep improves immune function</a>. For example, why are colds are more common in winter? Well, flu bouts peak during the light minimum (December) rather than the temperature minimum (February). Less light makes sleep worse, so this supports the idea that colds are more common in winter due to worse sleep. Likewise, <a href="http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/12/689.full" target="_blank">heart attacks are more common in the winter</a>, suggesting that better sleep would reduce heart attacks. <a href="http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866" target="_blank">I stopped getting obvious colds</a> when my sleep got much better.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21632713" target="_blank">Vaccinations are much less effective</a> if the person vaccinated is kept awake the following night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found new ways to improve my sleep: <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">avoid breakfast</a>, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">standing a lot</a>, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">morning light exposure</a>, <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/03/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/" target="_blank">one-legged standing</a>, and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=7671" target="_blank">eating more animal fat</a>. I&#8217;ve confirmed <a href="http://www.primalgirl.com/2011/11/01/nprimalgirl-sleep-issues-vitamin-d/" target="_blank">Tara Grant&#8217;s discovery of the value of Vitamin D3 in the morning</a>. I&#8217;ve made these improvements via low-tech tracking, good experimental design and data analysis, and wise choice of treatment.</p>
<p>I want to find out if my method and findings can help others. I am looking for people who would like my (paid) help improving their own sleep. In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/08/28/want-to-track-your-brain-function/" target="_blank">my search for people to try brain tracking</a>, I judged interest and motivation partly by willingness to pay and it worked well.. If you are interested, please submit an application (see below).</p>
<p>At least at first, I&#8217;ll only pick one or two people. I&#8217;ll do whatever I can to help the chosen applicants measure their sleep, choose wisely what to test, do useful experiments, and analyze the data. They can have as much contact with me as they want.</p>
<p>There are four ways you might benefit from this: (a) Sleep better. (b) Learn how to use personal science to improve your health in other ways. (c) Help everyone learn if the treatments you try have value. (I will try to publicize the results, whatever they are.)  (d) Help everyone learn the value of personal science to being healthy.</p>
<p>If this might interest you, please email <strong>sleep.where@gmail.com</strong> with your answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Name, age, sex, job, location</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Phone number (good times to call), skype id (if any).</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>What&#8217;s wrong with your sleep? For how long have you had this problem or problems?</strong></p>
<p>4. <strong>How have you tried to improve your sleep? What happened?</strong></p>
<p>5. <strong>How many colds do you get in a typical year? How long does a typical cold last?</strong></p>
<p>6. <strong>How much would you pay for the first month (after a free consultation)?</strong></p>
<p>7. <strong>How much would you pay per month after the first month?</strong></p>

					<p><em>A reader of this blog named Tony Mach <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/19/doctor-logic-acne-is-caused-by-bacteria/#comment-1041747" target="_blank">explains</a> how he figured out that his acne was caused by pasteurized dairy products:</em></p>
<p>In summer 2010 my health problems got noticeably worse (unrefreshing sleep, strange pains, strange sensations in the skin and other stuff I don’t want to share here <img src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" /> ), and I had to do something. Furthermore I was gaining weight,  so I was suspecting something along the lines of diabetes or other metabolic problem.</p>
<p>As I was looking into dietary changes, I stumbled over Wolfgang Lutz’s and Robert Atkins’ work. Being an engineer by training, I figured that if blood sugar might be the problem (which, as it turned out, wasn’t the case for me), then reducing carbs might be a solution (stop fueling the problematic sub-system) – so both Lutz and Atkins appealed to me. I thought let’s give it a try. I was a bit frightened about such an radical change of diet – you read all kind of BS – but hey, I felt like I was going to die anyway. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/30/acne-caused-by-pasteurized-dairy-how-one-person-figured-it-out/#more-7984" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>On the QS forums, <a href="http://forum.quantifiedself.com/thread-qs-utopia?pid=1940#pid1940" target="_blank">Christian Kleineidam asked</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While doing Quantified Self public relations I lately meet the challenge of explaining how our lives are going to change if everything in QS goes the way we want. A lot of what I do in quantified self is about boring details. . . .  Let&#8217;s imagine a day 20 years in the future and QS is successful. How will that day be different than [now]?</p></blockquote>
<p>Self-measurement has helped me two ways.  <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/26/quantified-self-utopia-what-would-it-look-like/#more-7937" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>
