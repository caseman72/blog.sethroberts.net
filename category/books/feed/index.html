				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got <em>Cure Unknown: Inside the Lyme Epidemic</em> (2008) by Pamela Weintraub from the library and found something surprising: an angry foreword. Weintraub is a science journalist; the foreword is by Hillary Johnson, another science journalist and apparently a friend of Weintraub&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In her anger, Johnson says several things I say on this blog.<span id="more-13482"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The more Weintraub investigated, the more virtually everyone with a shred of authority was losing their credibility. . . The so-called &#8220;objective&#8221; scientists were sending an entire disease down the river and over the cliff [meaning they ignored it] for reasons that seemed frequently to have more to do with mere opinion and crass external forces &#8212; cash, prestige, careerism &#8212; than with scientific erudition.</p>
<p>She rejected the science writer&#8217;s inbred habit of relying on the government official with the highest pay grade or the scientist with a job at Harvard as the final word on a topic. . . . I think of her, with enormous respect, as a &#8220;recovered&#8221; science journalist.</p>
<p>As one who also suffers from the disease I chronicled with kindred passion in <i>Osler&#8217;s Web</i>, I sometimes wonder if the only investigative writers who will possess the necessary temerity to remove the white gloves and tackle those putative experts to the ground will be those . . whose personal experience demands they follow the rocky trail that leads to the truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last point is the most important, I think. You can curse the careerism of Harvard medical school professors and the servility of science writers but that does nothing, or not much, and what you are upset about (careerism and servility) is unsurprising. Less obvious, at least to me, is that there is a way to overcome the careerism and servility. It <i>still</i> surprises me that I was able to figure out <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">interesting stuff about sleep, obesity, depression and so on</a> that the experts in these fields hadn&#8217;t figured out &#8212; and that sometimes contradicted what they said. (For example, I found sugar <i>isn&#8217;t</i> fattening.) As Johnson says, one reason I was able to learn so much was that I wanted to sleep better, lose weight, be in a better mood, and so on. Unlike the experts in those fields, for whom research was a job.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://zeynepton.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Good Jobs Strategy</em></a> by Zeynep Ton, published in January, argues that retailers should change low-level jobs in four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer fewer choices &#8212; fewer versions of each product.</li>
<li>Standardize common tasks and empower employees to handle unusual situations.</li>
<li>Cross-train employees so that each employee can do several jobs.</li>
<li>Operate with slack, that is, hire more employees than seemingly necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The brilliance of this book is that it addresses a major problem (bad jobs), includes substantial evidence and persuasive argument, is practical, and is exceedingly non-obvious (judging by how many retailers already follow her recommendations). Ton is an MIT business school professor whose area of expertise is operations.</p>
<p>I interviewed her by email.<span id="more-13027"></span></p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> How did you get into studying this? My impression is that the details of how employees are treated is not what operations professors usually study.</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> Early in my career I studied pervasive operational problems at retail stores that hurt supply chain and financial performance. My doctoral thesis was on misplaced products and the resulting phantom stockouts. I found that even retailers that were great at managing the backend of their supply chain, by getting the right products to the right stores at the right time, were pretty bad at managing the last ten yards of their supply chain. Once the products made it to the store, they would stay in the backroom or in the wrong place and often not meet the customer that wanted to buy them.</p>
<p>Problems like misplaced products were common, frequent, and had a huge impact on customer service, sales, and profits. When I studied what drove these problems I found that stores that had more workload for employees, lower training, and more employee turnover had worse performance.</p>
<p>Things really clicked for me several years ago when I was presenting my research to a group of retail managers and executives. I showed them my findings from analyzing a lot of data from Borders that showed that if stores increased the amount of people they would make more money. This finding just didn’t make sense—why would managers staff their stores with too few people even though having more would increase profits? When I asked people in the audience to raise their hands if I would find a similar result if I analyzed data from their chain, almost all raised their hands.</p>
<p>What I saw was that a lot of retailers were operating in what I call a vicious cycle. Low investment in employees caused operational problems, which reduced customer service, sales, and profits. When stores had low sales and profits, they had low labor budgets, which further reduced their investment in employees.</p>
<p>Everybody suffers from this vicious cycle. Employees have bad jobs, customer get bad service, and investors are worse off because there is a lot of money left at the table. I thought there have to be some companies that operate much better. That’s how I started looking at firms that follow the good jobs strategy.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> How have your ideas on this subject changed over the years?</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> There was a period when I wasn’t sure if excellence was possible in low-cost retail. All the examples around me were of retailers that offered bad jobs and had poor operational performance. When I went to Spain to study Mercadona I realized that I finally had found the “Toyota Production System” of retailing. What really excited me was studying QuikTrip after Mercadona. Here were two completely different companies—the largest supermarket chain in Spain and a convenience store chain with gas stations based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Yet they were both beating their competitors by offering much better jobs than their competitors. At the same time they were both offering low prices and great service to their customers.</p>
<p>When I looked into what allowed them to deliver value to their employees, customers, and investors at the same time, I saw that they were both excellent operators. They were both making a set of operational choices that reduced costs, increased employee productivity, and allowed employees to have a big role in driving profits. When I looked at Costco and Trader Joe’s, I saw they were making the same choices. In my book I highlight the four choices I observed [shared by these four companies].</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> When you present these ideas to retailers, what is their reaction? Of course there is a range of reactions, but which reactions surprised you the most? Which reactions did you learn the most from?</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> The reaction that I learned most from is the following. When Marshall Fisher, a Wharton professor and a thought leader in operations management, presented his finding that retailers could make more money by increasing staffing levels, a CEO said, &#8220;I spend my days saying no to a long line of people suggesting ways to spend money, including adding more staff. I don&#8217;t need a couple of Ivy League professors with their fancy statistical analysis giving them more ammunition!&#8221;</p>
<p>This really shows how retailers view their labor — as a cost to be minimized.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px;">ROBERTS </strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">What do you think about how Amazon treats employees? Do you have any suggestions for them? [The book is published by Amazon.]</span></p>
<p><strong>TON </strong>I have not studied Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> Your book lacked a chapter called &#8220;What Happens When&#8230;&#8221; about what happens when companies try to implement the changes you suggest &#8212; I mean, make changes based on your research. Can you say anything about that?</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> Of the four model retailers that follow the good jobs strategy, only one went through a dramatic change. Mercadona started as a company that operated just like most companies operate right now, but had to change in order to compete against much larger companies. I hope that my book will encourage more companies to adopt a good jobs strategy. If I can observe some of these changes, I will be in a better position to offer suggestions for implementation.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>ROBERTS</strong> It seems to me the underlying theme of your book is &#8220;Look, your employees have brains. The more you take advantage of those brains, the better off everyone &#8212; you, them, owners, customers &#8212; will be.&#8221; Is that a fair summary?</span></p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> One could say that the book is about designing the work that employees do to leverage committed, motivated, and capable employees. It’s also about making smart operational choices that benefit employees, customers, and investors at the same time.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px;">ROBERTS </strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Do you have a theory &#8212; is there a theory &#8212; that ties your four suggestions (&#8220;operational choices&#8221;) together? Is there an underlying principle from which all four of them can be deduced?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>TON </strong>The four choices I observed are choices that operationally excellent companies have been making for decades and they could be traced to lean manufacturing. Overall, the good jobs strategy—the combination of the four choices and investment in people—is a blueprint for operational excellence.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px;">ROBERTS</strong><span style="font-size: 13px;"> Why has it been hard to learn to make the choices you describe?</span></p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> Unfortunately, the dominant view in business is that paying employees as little as possible and treating them as a cost to be minimized is the best and perhaps only way to run a profitable business, especially in industries with low profit margins.</p>
<p>As I show in my book, that’s not the only way and that’s not even the best way.</p>
<p>But companies can make bad choices just like people can make bad choices. We know exercising is great for our health but regular exercise requires commitment, discipline, hard work and a long-term view. The good jobs strategy is good for companies’ health but that too requires commitment, discipline, hard work, and long-term view.</p>
<p>Excellence is always harder to achieve than mediocrity. And right now we have too many companies stuck in mediocrity.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>You say &#8220;the dominant view in business is that paying employees as little as possible and treating them as a cost to be minimized is the best and perhaps only way to run a profitable business, especially in industries with low profit margins.&#8221; That is a common-sense view that Adam Smith might have expounded. Why has such a wrong view persisted so long? On the face of it, I would think that how to treat employees would be one of the central questions that business professors (and CEOs) try to answer and nobody would be satisfied with repeating ideas of several hundred years ago. It&#8217;s one thing for a third grade teacher to tell students &#8220;the earth is flat&#8221; &#8212; yes, it looks vaguely flat. But for sophisticated university professors and captains of industry to say &#8220;the earth is flat&#8221; for hundreds of years when there is a vast amount of money to be made from realizing it isn&#8217;t flat, that is puzzling.</p>
<p><strong>TON  </strong>But it&#8217;s not just ignorance. Perhaps I should have worded it differently.  Following the good jobs strategy is not easy. You have to get many things right.  It requires excellence.</p>
<p><strong>POSTSCRIPT </strong>This is what Ton said in the book &#8212; that the good jobs strategy is difficult. I wasn&#8217;t persuaded. CEOs of major retailers have done many things that are not easy. Why has this difficult thing been out of reach?</p>
<p>I suspect an examination of why the 4 retailers Ton study broke from the pack and treated their employees differently would not find that the people in charge were more capable of excellence than the leaders of other companies. Maybe their personalities were different, maybe their cultures (internal company culture or external society culture) were different, I have no idea.</p>
<p>I am unsurprised that business profs had failed to figure out what Ton figured out (although her conclusions are supported by the work of other professors). Other disciplines have enormous blind spots &#8212; epidemiologists never study the immune system, for example. The more things you can take for granted, such as the idea that labor is a cost to be minimized, the easier it is to publish papers. In academia what is rewarded and selected for is not solving real problems, it is publishing papers in prestigious journals, which is quite different.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I finished <i>The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty</i> by Nina Munk, I thought of something a graduate student in English had told me: <em>A little Derrida goes a long way and a lot of Derrida goes a little way</em>. It was literally true. A few sentences by Derrida, you could think about for days, maybe productively. A whole book by him was baffling and irritating. <em>A lot of Jeffrey Sachs goes a little way</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>When it came out (2005), I thought <i>The End of Poverty</i> by Sachs was the ravings of a lunatic. Munk&#8217;s book shows I was right but I had to admit that George Soros giving Sachs $100 million or whatever to put his ideas into practice (to &#8220;test&#8221; them) was considerably more interesting than the activities of the other billionaires Munk had written about before Sachs. Soros had an advisory board whose reaction to Sachs&#8217;s ideas was the same as mine but Soros overruled them. Soros was right. A tiny bit was learned from spending all that money, which is better than learning nothing. Certainly I learned more than if the money had been used to buy a private jet.</p>
<p>As an assistant professor doing animal learning experiments, I saw over and over that it was incredibly hard to learn anything. Anything. No doubt all science professors who are honest learn this. But then I saw something that is less easy to see: If doing the &#8220;right&#8221; thing pays off worse than we expect &#8212; Sachs&#8217;s flamboyant failure in Africa is an example &#8212; then <strong>doing the &#8220;wrong&#8221; thing should pay off better</strong>. If spending an enormous amount of money we learn less than expected, then when we spend very little money we should learn more than expected. This is the upside of ignorance. The less you know, the easier it is to learn more. And we know much less than famous professors, such as Sachs, say we know.</p>
<p>My personal science is the polar opposite of what Sachs did. He tried to help others (poor Africans), I try to help myself. He tries to help people he knows almost nothing about, I try to help myself &#8212; and I know a lot about myself. He tried to do something big (end poverty). I try to do something small (e.g., sleep better). What he did cost millions of dollars. What I do costs nothing. I can test a new idea about how to sleep better in days. Sachs took years to test his ideas. For me, failure costs almost nothing. Sachs&#8217;s failure cost him years of his life. You have to be an extraordinary person with great talent to do what Sachs did. Whereas anyone can do personal science.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Edward Jay Epstein has just published a new book called <em>The JFK Assassination Diary</em> based on the diary he kept when he wrote <em>Inquest</em>. It is available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ASSASSINATION-ANSWERS-MYSTERY-CENTURY-ebook/dp/B00FHLKDM2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380804459&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=jfk+assassination+diary" target="_blank">Kindle</a>, Nook and as an Itunes ebook. It will soon be available in paperback.</p>
<p>He wrote me about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you know I was the only person to interview the Warren Commission as well as its staff and liaisons with the intelligence services. I did these interviews as an undergraduate at Cornell with no credentials as a journalist, scholar, or author. My interviews also produced a revelation that shook the journalistic establishment, which had been blithely reporting until the publication of my book <i>Inquest</i> that the Commission had left no stone unturned in an exhaustive investigation. In fact, as I showed, it was a brief, sporadic, and incomplete investigation. Indeed one in which the senior staff lawyer in charge of the crime scene investigation quit after two days, and the young lawyer who took his place, Arlen Specter, was never able to view the single most crucial piece of evidence &#8212; the autopsy photographs. The Commission was never able to obtain them, nor other pieces of evidence, because Robert Kennedy blocked it. For the same reason, the Commission was not provided with any information about a parallel plot to kill Castro in 1963. The Commission could not connect dots to which it was denied access.</p>
<p>I had no problem getting this information. Many of the young lawyers on the staff were furious with the way the investigation had been handled and the time pressure imposed on them. So they gave me FBI reports, payroll records and their memos, without me even asking. This raises a question. As these lawyers and Commission members were not bound by any secrecy agreement, as amazing as that might seem nowadays, why had not journalists from major news organizations sought the same information from them? After all, in 1963, the Kennedy assassination was the crime of the century. Fifty years later, I still cannot answer this question.</p></blockquote>
<p>A very good question. Why weren&#8217;t journalists from major news organizations more . . . enterprising? It is <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/27/the-emperors-new-clothes-trilogy/" target="_blank">another variation on The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes</a>, where a Cornell undergraduate manages to see what many much more experienced and credentialed experts failed to see, or avoided seeing. I would answer Epstein&#8217;s question like this: The experts were disinterested in gathering evidence that might contradict their world view. That world view included a belief in the competence of exceedingly important government commissions. They didn&#8217;t want to gather evidence that might make them uncomfortable. I see this every year at Nobel Prize time. No journalist ever questions the claims in the press releases that accompany the prizes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/08/09/the-truth-in-small-doses-interview-with-clifton-leaf-part-1-of-2/" target="_blank">Part 1 of this interview</a> about Leaf&#8217;s book <em>The Truth in Small Doses: Why We&#8217;re Losing the War on Cancer &#8212; and How to Win It</em> was posted yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>SR</strong> You say we should “let scientists learn as they go”. For example, reduce the need for grant proposals to require tests of hypotheses. I agree. I think most scientists know very little about how to generate plausible ideas. If they were allowed to try to do this, as you propose, they would learn how to do it. However, I failed to find evidence in your book that a “let scientists learn as they go” strategy works better (leaving aside Burkitt). Did I miss something?</p>
<p><strong>CL</strong> Honestly, I don’t think we know yet that such a strategy would work. What we have in the way of evidence is a historical control (to some extent, we did try this approach in pediatric cancers in the 1940s through the 1960s) and a comparator arm (the current system) that so far has been shown to be ineffective. </p>
<p>As I tried to show in the book, the process now isn’t working. And much of what doesn’t work is what we’ve added in the way of bad management. Start with a lengthy, arduous, grants applications process that squelches innovative ideas, that funds barely 10 percent of a highly trained corps of academic scientists and demoralizes the rest, and that rewards the same applicants (and types of proposals) over and over despite little success or accountability. This isn’t the natural state of science. We BUILT that. We created it through bad management and lousy systems.<br />
Same for where we are in drug development. We’ve set up clinical trials rules that force developers to spend years ramping up expensive human studies to test for statistical significance, even when the vast majority of the time, the question being asked is of little clinical significance. The human cost of this is enormous, as so many have acknowledged.</p>
<p>With regard to basic research, one has only to talk to young researchers (and examine the funding data) to see how badly skewed the grants process has become. As difficult (and sometimes inhospitable) as science has always been, it has never been THIS hard for a young scientist to follow up on questions that he or she thinks are important. In 1980, more than 40 percent of major research grants went to investigators under 40; today it’s less than 10 percent. For anyone asking provocative, novel questions (those that the study section doesn’t “already know the answer to,” as the saying goes), the odds of funding are even worse.</p>
<p>So, while I can&#8217;t say for sure that an alternative system would be better, I believe that given the current state of affairs, taking a leap into the unknown might be worth it.</p>
<p><strong>SR</strong> I came across nothing about how it was discovered that smoking causes lung cancer. Why not? I would have thought we can learn a lot from how this discovery was made.</p>
<p><strong>CL</strong> I wish I had spent more time on smoking. I mention it a few times in the book. In discussing Hoffman (pg. 34, and footnote, pg. 317), I say:</p>
<blockquote><p>He also found more evidence to support the connection of “chronic irritation” from smoking with the rise in cancers of the mouth and throat. “The relation of smoking to cancer of the buccal [oral] cavity,” he wrote, “is apparently so well established as not to admit of even a question of doubt.” (By 1931, he would draw an unequivocal link between smoking and lung cancer—a connection it would take the surgeon general an additional three decades to accept.)</p></blockquote>
<p>And I make a few other brief allusions to smoking throughout the book. But you’re right, I gave this preventable scourge short shrift. Part of why I didn’t spend more time on smoking was that I felt its role in cancer was well known, and by now, well accepted. Another reason (though I won’t claim it’s an excusable one) is that Robert Weinberg did such a masterful job of talking about this discovery in “Racing to the Beginning of the Road,” which I consider to be the single best book on cancer.</p>
<p>I do talk about Weinberg’s book in my own, but I should have singled out his chapter on the discovery of this link (titled “Smoke and Mirrors”), which is as much a story of science as it is a story of scientific culture.</p>
<p><strong>SR</strong> Overall you say little about epidemiology. You write about Burkitt but the value of his epidemiology is unclear. Epidemiology has found many times that there are big differences in cancer rates between different places (with different lifestyles).  This suggests that something about lifestyle has a big effect on cancer rates. This seems to me a very useful clue about how to prevent cancer. Why do you say nothing about this line of research (lifestyle epidemiology)?</p>
<p><strong>CL</strong> Seth, again, I agree. I don’t spend enough time discussing the role that good epidemiology can play in cancer prevention. In truth, I had an additional chapter on the subject, which began by discussing decades of epidemiological work linking the herbicide 2-4-D with various cancers, particularly with prostate cancer in the wheat-growing states of the American west (Montana, the Dakotas and Minnesota). I ended up cutting the chapter in an effort to make the book a bit shorter (and perhaps faster). But maybe that was a mistake.</p>
<p>For what’s it worth, I do believe that epidemiology is an extremely valuable tool for cancer prevention.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found a lot to like and agree with in <em>The Truth in Small Doses: Why We&#8217;re Losing the War on Cancer &#8212; and How to Win It</em> by Clifton Leaf, published recently. It grew out of a 2004 article in <em>Fortune</em> in which Leaf described poor results from cancer research and said that cancer researchers work under a system that &#8220;rewards academic achievement and publication over all else&#8221; &#8212; in particular, over &#8220;genuine breakthroughs.&#8221; I did not agree, however, with his recommendations for improvement, which seemed to reflect the same thinking that got us here. It reminded me of President Obama putting in charge of fixing the economy the people who messed it up. However, Leaf had spent a lot of time on the book, and obviously cared deeply, and had freedom of speech (he doesn&#8217;t have to worry about offending anyone, as far as I can tell) so I wondered how he would defend his point of view.</p>
<p>Here is Part 1 of an interview in which Leaf answered written questions.<span id="more-11159"></span></p>
<p><strong>SR</strong> Let me begin by saying I think the part of the book that describes the problem – little progress in reducing cancer – is excellent. You do a good job of contrasting the amount of time and money spent with progress actually made and pointing out that the system seems designed to produce papers rather than progress. What I found puzzling is the part about how to do  better. That’s what I want to ask you about.</p>
<p>In the Acknowledgements, you say Andy Grove said “a few perfect words” that helped shape your thesis. What were those words?</p>
<p><strong>CL </strong>“It’s like a Greek tragedy. Everybody plays his individual part to perfection, everybody does what’s right by his own life, and the total just doesn’t work.” Andy had come to a meeting at <em>Fortune</em>, mostly just to chat. I can’t remember what the main topic of conversation was, but when I asked him a question about progress in the war on cancer, he said the above. (I quote this in the 2004 piece I wrote for <em>Fortune</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>SR</strong> You praise Michael Sporn. His great contribution, you say, is an emphasis on prevention.  I have a hard time seeing this as much of a contribution. The notion that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is ancient. What progress has Sporn made in the prevention of anything?</p>
<p><strong>CL</strong> Would it be alright, Seth, if before I answer the question, I bring us back to what I said in the book? Because I think the point I was trying to make &#8212; successfully or not (and I’m guessing you would conclude “not” here) &#8212; is more nuanced than “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”</p>
<p>Here’s what I see as the key passage regarding Dr. Sporn (pgs. 133-135):</p>
<blockquote><p>For all his contributions to biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology, though, Sporn is still better known for something else. Rather than any one molecular discovery, it is an idea. The notion is so straightforward—so damned obvious, really—that it is easy to forget how revolutionary it was when he first proposed it in the mid-1970s: cancer, Sporn contended, could (and should) be chemically stopped, slowed, or reversed in its earliest preinvasive stages.</p>
<p>That was it. That was the whole radical idea.</p>
<p>Sporn was not the first to propose such an idea. Lee Wattenberg at the University of Minnesota had suggested the strategy in 1966 to little response. But Sporn refined it, pushed it, and branded it: To distinguish such intervention from the standard form of cancer treatment, chemotherapy—a therapy that sadly comes too late for roughly a third of patients to be therapeutic—he coined the term chemoprevention in 1976.</p>
<p>The name stuck.</p>
<p>On first reading, the concept might seem no more than a truism. But to grasp the importance of chemoprevention, one has first to dislodge the mind-set that has long reigned over the field of oncology: that cancer is a disease state. “One has cancer or one doesn’t.” Such a view, indeed, is central to the current practice of cancer medicine: oncologists today discover the event of cancer in a patient and respond—typically, quite urgently. This thinking is shared by patients, the FDA, drug developers, and health insurers (who decide what to pay for). This is the default view of cancer.</p>
<p>And, to Sporn, it is dead wrong. Cancer is not an event or a “state” of any kind. The disease does not suddenly come into being with a discovered lump on the mammogram. It does not begin with the microscopic lesion found on the chest X-ray. Nor when the physician lowers his or her voice and tells the patient, “I’m sorry. The pathology report came back positive. . . . You have cancer.”</p>
<p>Nor does the disease begin, says Sporn, when the medical textbooks say it does: when the first neoplastic cell breaks through the “basement membrane,” the meshwork layers of collagen and other proteins that separate compartments of bodily tissue. In such traditional thinking, it matters little whether a cell, or population of cells, has become immortalized through mutation. Or how irregular or jumbled the group might look under the microscope. Or how otherwise disturbed their genomes are. As long as none of the clones have breached the basement membrane, the pathology is not (yet) considered “cancer.”</p>
<p>For more than a century, this barrier has been the semantic line that separates the fearsome “invader” from the merely “abnormal.” It is the Rubicon of cancer diagnosis. From the standpoint of disease mechanics, the rationale is easy to understand, because just beyond this fibrous gateway are fast-moving channels (the blood and lymphatic vessels) that can conceivably transport a predatory cell, or cells, to any terrain in the body. Busting through the basement is therefore a seeming leap past the point of no return, a signal that a local disturbance is potentially emerging into a disseminating mob.*</p>
<p>But while invasion may define so-called clinical cancer for legions of first-year medical students, it is by no means the start of the pathology. Cancer is not any one act; it is a process. It begins with the first hints of subversion in the normal differentiation of a cell—with the first disruption of communication between that cell and its immediate environment. There is, perhaps, no precise moment of conception in this regard, no universally accepted beginning—which makes delineating the process that much harder. But most, if not all, types of “cancer” have their own somewhat recognizable stages of evolution along the route to clinically apparent disease.</p>
<p>“Saying it’s not cancer until the cells are through the basement membrane,” says Sporn, “is like saying the barn isn’t on fire until there are bright red flames coming out of the roof. It’s absolute nonsense!”</p></blockquote>
<p>(Sorry for that long excerpt.) I think that Dr. Sporn’s greatest contribution was to reframe cancer as a continually evolving, dynamic process — carcinogenesis — rather than an event or state of being. And it was one that, conceivably at least, we could interrupt — and interrupt earlier than at the point at which it was clinically manifested. This was distinct from early detection, which, while effective to some extent and in some cancers, was both detecting cancers too late and “catching” many lesions that weren’t likely to develop any further (or didn’t really exist to begin with), adding to the already-great cancer burden.</p>
<p>There was a potential, said Sporn, to intervene in a way that might stop developing cancers in their tracks, and yet would not necessarily have to add to the burden of cancer overtreatment.</p>
<p>As I spend most of Chapter 7 discussing, there are enormous barriers to pulling this of—and I did my best to lay out the challenges. But I do believe that this is the way to go in the end.</p>
<p><strong>SR</strong> You praise Kathy Giusti for her effect on multiple myeloma research. I couldn’t find the part where that research (“a worthy model for cancer research that can serve as a guidepost for the future . . . that teaches everything there is to teach about the power of collaborative science”, p. 260) came up with something useful.</p>
<p><strong>CL</strong> Seth, sorry this again may be me not being very clear in my writing. I apologize for that. But the lines you cite actually are intended to set up the Burkitt story in the following chapter. It was Burkitt’s effort against the mysterious African lymphoma, that remains, in my view, “a worthy model for cancer research…”</p>
<p><strong>SR</strong> You praise Burkitt’s epidemiology. How did that epidemiology help find out that Burkitt’s lymphoma responds to certain drugs? I couldn&#8217;t see a connection.</p>
<p><strong>CL</strong> Good question. I think Burkitt’s very old-fashioned epidemiological investigation identified a widespread, terrible cancer that had been seen many times, but not noticed for what it was. It helped narrow down who was getting this cancer and—at least in a broad, geographical sense—why. But it wasn’t epidemiology that helped discover that this lymphoma was responsive to certain drugs—that was trial and error. As with the case of Farber and ALL [acute lymphocytic leukemia], many today would blanch at the primitive experimental protocols that tested these toxic drugs in children. But with an extraordinarily aggressive tumor that was killing these kids in weeks, Burkitt felt he had to try <i>something</i>. Again, that’s not epidemiology, but it is an understanding of the urgency of this disease that we can, perhaps, learn from.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The publisher sent me a copy of <em>Give and Take</em> by Adam Grant after I sent several emails asking for a review copy. I expected it to be the best book about psychology in many years and it is.</p>
<p>The book&#8217;s main theme is the non-obvious advantages of being a &#8220;giver&#8221; (someone who helps others without concern about payback). Grant teaches at Wharton, whose students apparently enter Wharton believing (or are taught there?) that this is a poor strategy. With dozens of studies and stories, Grant argues that the truth is more complicated &#8212; that a giver, properly focussed, does better than others. Whether this reflects cause and effect (Grant seems to say it does) I have no idea. Perhaps &#8220;givers&#8221; are psychologically unusually sophisticated in many ways, not just a relaxed attitude toward payback, and that is why some of them do very well.<span id="more-10353"></span></p>
<p>I was more impressed with two other things where cause and effect is clearer. One is a story about communication style. It is the best story in a book full of good stories. About ten years ago, Grant was asked to teach senior military officers how to motivate their troops. His first class was a four-hour lecture to Air Force colonels in their forties and fifties. Grant was 24.  The feedback forms, filled out by the students after the class, reflected the age &#8212; and presumably wisdom &#8212; discrepancy. One comment was: &#8220;More quality information in audience than on podium.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grant taught the class again, to another group of Air Force colonels. Instead of talking about his credentials at the start of the class, he began like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know what some of you are thinking right now: What can I possibly learn from a professor who&#8217;s twelve years old?</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone laughed. Grant does not say what he said next &#8212; how he answered the question. He went on to give the same lecture he had given before. The difference in feedback was &#8220;night and day&#8221;. Here is one of the comments: &#8220;Spoke with personal experience. He was the right age! High energy; clearly successful already.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is great. A non-obvious, seemingly small change produces a huge outcome difference. Grant clearly understands something enormously important about communication that isn&#8217;t not found in other psychology books, such as introductory textbooks. It isn&#8217;t easy to interpret (why exactly did Grant&#8217;s new opening have its effect?) nor study experimentally &#8212; but that&#8217;s fine. In <em>Give and Take</em>, Grant follows this story with research about what is called &#8220;the pratfall effect&#8221;: Under some circumstances making a blunder (such as spilling a cup of coffee) makes a speaker more likeable. But Grant&#8217;s opening (&#8220;what can I learn&#8230;&#8221;) isn&#8217;t a blunder. Grant calls it an &#8220;expression of vulnerability&#8221;, a category broad enough to include pratfalls &#8212; fair enough.</p>
<p>What can we learn from Grant&#8217;s story? Above all, that something mysterious and powerful happens or might happen at the beginning of a talk and that ordinary feedback forms are sensitive enough to detect it. What Grant did was highly specific to the situation (young speaker, older military officers) so you can&#8217;t copy it. To use it you really have to grasp the general rule. Which remains to be determined. </p>
<p>Tomorrow I will blog about another impressive part of the book.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renata Adler&#8217;s two novels, <em>Speedboat</em> (1976) and <em>Pitch Dark</em> (1988), have just been reissued by New York Review Books.  I was pleased to see <a href="http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/renata-adler-2013-3/" target="_blank">a recent <em>New York</em> article about her</a>. Here is my two cents:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gone-The-Last-Days-Yorker/dp/0684808161/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363664171&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=renata+adler" target="_blank"><em>Gone: The Last Days of The New Yorker</em></a> (2000) is one of my favorite books. It can be summed up like this: <em>Genius corrupts</em>. I first came across it in the Berkeley Barnes &amp; Noble. I couldn&#8217;t stop reading it. When I left the store hours later my scooter had a parking ticket.</p>
<p>2. Her libel lawsuit is described <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=2&amp;xmldoc=19862201643FSupp1558_11978.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006&amp;SizeDisp=7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>3. She wrote <a href="http://www.bilderberg.org/pepis00.htm" target="_blank">a book about the Bilderberg Group</a> called <em>Private Capacity</em>. It was announced then cancelled.</p>
<p>4. During a panel discussion televised on C-Span, she took a phone call. It appeared to be from her daughter.</p>
<p>5. For several years she <a href="http://www.bu.edu/nisprod/coursedesc/data/archives/200709251128/www.bu.edu/bulletins/com/item17.html" target="_blank">taught journalism</a> at Boston University. A student said she told great stories.</p>
<p>6. In a book review, she said that Woodward and Bernstein&#8217;s Deep Throat was made up. Apparently she was wrong about that.</p>
<p>7. During a dinner I had with <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/03/11/130311fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all" target="_blank">Aaron Swartz</a> last summer, he praised <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1980/aug/14/the-perils-of-pauline/?pagination=false" target="_blank">her article attacking Pauline Kael</a> (&#8220;The Perils of Pauline&#8221;, 1980).</p>
<p>8. When her article about Kael came out, a friend of mine said, <em>Now she&#8217;ll be known as the person who attacked Kael. </em>My friend was wrong. She is better known as <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2000/08/a-court-of-no-appeal/" target="_blank">the person attacked by eight articles in the <em>New York Times</em></a> when <em>Gone</em> was published. One short non-best-selling book, eight negative articles from the most powerful pulpit on earth.</p>
<p>9. <em>Gone</em> and some books by Jane Jacobs were the only books I took to China. I also adore <em>Totto-Chan</em> but I suppose I have memorized it. I mostly read books by men, so I am puzzled that all my most favorite books are by women. A Chinese friend of mine stayed in my Beijing apartment while I was gone. Her English isn&#8217;t very good but she praised <em>Gone</em>, which she called <em>Lost</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.aidsorigins.com/content/view/230/2/">This book review</a> of <em>Spillover</em> by David Quammen is quite unfavorable about <a href="http://www.lauriegarrett.com/">Laurie Garrett</a>, the Pulitzer-Prize-winning science journalist. Several years ago, at the UC Berkeley journalism school, I heard her talk. During the question period, I made a comment something like this: &#8220;It seems to me there is kind of a conspiracy between the science journalist and the scientist. Both of them want the science to be more important than it really is. The scientist wants publicity. The science journalist wants their story on the front page. The effect is that things get exaggerated, this or that finding is claimed to be more important than it really is.&#8221; Garrett didn&#8217;t agree. She did not give a reason. This was interesting, since I thought my point was obviously true.</p>
<p>The book review, by Edward Hooper, author of <em>The River</em>, a book about the origin of AIDS,  makes a more subtle point. It is about how he has been ignored.</p>
<blockquote><p>When I wrote The River, I did my level best to interview each of the major living protagonists involved in the origins-of-AIDS debate. This amounted to well over 600 interviews, mostly of two hours or more, and about 500 of which were done face-to-face rather than down the phone. Although the authors of the three aforementioned books (Pepin, Timberg and Halperin, Nattrass) all devote time and several pages to The River, and to claims that I definitely got it wrong, not one of them bothered to contact me at any point &#8211; either to challenge my findings, or to ask me questions. However, I have been contacted by someone through my website (a lawyer and social scientist) who asked me several questions, to all of which I responded. Later, this man read the first two of these three pro-bushmeat books and contacted the authors of each by email, to ask them one or two simple questions about their dismissal of the OPV hypothesis [= the AIDS virus came from an oral polio vaccine]. His letters to Pepin, Timberg and Halperin (which he later forwarded to me) were courteous and non-confrontational, and in two instances he sent three separate letters, but apparently not one of the authors could be bothered to reply to any of these approaches.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, there is a kind of moat. Inside the moat, are the respected people &#8212; the &#8220;real&#8221; scientists. Outside the moat are the crazy people, whom it is a good idea to ignore. Even if they have written a book on the topic. Hooper and those who agreed with him were outside the moat.</p>
<p>Hooper quotes Quammen:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hooper&#8217;s book was massive&#8221;, Quammen writes, &#8220;overwhelmingly detailed, seemingly reasonable, exhausting to plod through, but mesmerizing in its claims&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I look forward to the day that the Shangri-La Diet is called &#8220;seemingly reasonable&#8221;. Quammen and Garrett (whose Coming Plague has yet to come) write about science for a living. I have a theory about their behavior. To acknowledge misaligned incentives (scientists, like journalists, care about other things than truth )  and power relationships (some scientists are in a position to censor other scientists and points of view they dislike) would make their jobs considerably harder. They are afraid of what would happen to them &#8212; would they be kicked out, placed on the other side of the moat? &#8212; if they took &#8220;crazy&#8221; views seriously. It is also time-consuming to take &#8220;crazy&#8221; views seriously (&#8220;massive . . . exhausting&#8221;). So they ignore them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amy Chua wondered if all the pressure to practice (piano, older child, violin, younger child) she put on her two children was worth it. But then there were moments like these:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="calibre9" data-mce-mark="1">In a glass-windowed room overlooking the Mediterranean, Sophia played Mendelsohn&#8217;s <em>Rondo Capriccioso</em>, and got bravos and hugs from all the guests.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Which I found the most chilling sentence in the whole book. Her daughter&#8217;s recognition (&#8220;bravos and hugs&#8221;) made Chua very happy. But did it make Sophia happy? Chua doesn&#8217;t answer that question. She doesn&#8217;t follow the sentence I&#8217;ve quoted with &#8220;I could see how pleased she was&#8221; or &#8220;Years later she would say what a good time she had&#8221;. Nope, the chapter ends there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The title comes from Andrew Montford&#8217;s new book <em><a href="http://www.bishop-hill.net/hiding-the-decline/" target="_blank">Hiding the Decline</a></em> (copy given me by author) about Climategate. From an introductory section:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the figures were published the extraordinary lack of data underlying the blade of the Yamal hockey stick caused a minor sensation. In fact the high point at the end of the graph was shown to have been based on only four trees, and only one of these had the hockey stick shape. McIntyre dubbed it ‘the most influential tree in the world’.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of <em>Hiding the Decline</em> is about the inquiries that followed Climategate. I enjoyed reading about smug powerful people making fools of themselves and the fairy-tale-like consternation created by two unlikely events: 1. A non-scientist (<a href="http://climateaudit.org/" target="_blank">Steve McIntyre</a>) gets involved in the global warming debate. As in a fairy tale, McIntyre is free to speak the truth. In particular, he is free to question. Professional climate scientists cannot speak the truth for fear of career damage. 2. The release of the Climategate emails. As in a fairy tale, a sudden burst of truth about bad behavior previously hidden. <span id="more-8770"></span></p>
<p><em>Hiding the Decline</em> is as well-written as a book by a professional writer but this is a book no professional science writer could write due to its investment in an officially-wrong point of view. There are lots of badly-written books from tiny-minority points of view. The appearance of a well-written one, joining Montford&#8217;s earlier <em><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/22/the-hockey-stick-illusion/" target="_blank">The Hockey Stick Illusion</a></em>, is no small deal. How much free speech do we have? It depends on the medium. Maybe the sequence from less to more censored is: 1. Conversation. 2. Email and other private writing. 3. Blog post. 4. Poorly-written book. 5. Article in minor magazine. 6. Well-written book. 7. Article in prestigious magazine. 8. Textbook. From one step to the next (e.g., from conversation to email), views become less diverse. This book is disagreement with the official line high up the tree.</p>
<p>One reason we enjoy certain jokes is that they speak a forbidden truth. When you can&#8217;t usually say it, the truth is funny. The forbidden truth aspect of <em>Hiding the Decline</em> is another reason I enjoyed it so much.</p>
<p>Does the story have a happy ending? Montford thinks not:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we look back over the ten years of this story, the impression we get is of a wave of dishonesty, a public sector that will spin and lie, and mislead and lie, and distort and lie, and lie again. . . . Despite the emails showing, apparently incontrovertibly, that FOI laws were flouted with the full knowledge of senior figures in university, there have been almost no discernible repercussions for anyone involved. . . . The response to [Climategate] was an extraordinary failure of the institutions and of the people who are paid to protect the public interest – a failure of honesty, a failure of diligence, a failure of integrity.</p></blockquote>
<p>My view is different. The institutions (University of East Anglia, Penn State, and so on) and officials (e.g., Vice Chancellor of the University of East Anglia) &#8220;failed&#8221; only in their ostensible purpose.  Their actual purpose centers on protecting the people who created or hired them (see <em>The Dictator&#8217;s Handbook</em>). At this they succeeded, but suffered a large loss of credibility. To me, Climategate is the story of how two people &#8212; Steve McIntyre and the hacker of the Climategate emails &#8212; both with zero official standing, had a huge effect on worldwide public discourse. (A Google search for Climategate returns about 2 million hits.) They exposed dishonesty in powerful and heretofore respected people (science professors) on a matter far more important than expense accounts. They pushed the rest of us a non-trivial distance toward seeing the truth. I didn&#8217;t know that was possible, and I&#8217;m glad it is.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know how dangerous prescription sleeping pills are? I didn&#8217;t, and I do sleep research.</p>
<p>I came across Dr. Daniel Kripke&#8217;s book <em><a href="http://www.darksideofsleepingpills.com/index.html" target="_blank">Dark Side of Sleeping Pills</a></em> while finishing <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/10/undisclosed-risks-of-common-treatments-why-doctors-terrify-me/?preview=true" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post on undisclosed risks of medical treatments</a>. I had written an almost-complete draft a year ago. One line in the draft said &#8220;undisclosed risks of sleeping pills&#8221; with no additional information. I couldn&#8217;t remember why I&#8217;d written that so I googled &#8220;dangers of sleeping pills&#8221; and found Dr. Kripke&#8217;s book. I was unaware the evidence was so strong. I asked Dr. Kripke to tell the story of how he came to write it. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is almost a life-long story.</p>
<p>As a young psychiatrist, I learned that the American Cancer Society had done a questionnaire survey of a million people which showed mortality related to long and short sleep. [People who sleep less or more than average have higher death rates.] In 1975, I asked if they would collaborate with me on a more complete analysis of the data on sleep length and insomnia.  As a control variable, we included analysis of their one question about sleeping pill use.  To my surprise, it looked like sleeping pill use was a strong predictor of early death, while insomnia was not (if you controlled for sleeping pill use by insomniacs).<span id="more-8675"></span></p>
<p>There were many reasons why these results needed further study, so I asked if I could refine the questions for the new Cancer Prevention Study II (CPSII) which the American Cancer Society commenced in 1982 with 1.1 million participants. Imagine my surprise when I observed that sleeping pill use was associated with a comparable mortality hazard ratio as cigarette smoking! These studies, and about 20 more done all over the world with similar results, had two important limitations: in general, the studies did not identify the sleeping pills used and did not measure whether those taking sleeping pills at the start of the study continued the drugs, or whether those who were not taking sleeping pills (the comparison group) started taking them.  So another study was needed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sleeping pills were never my main scientific concern.  I was mainly interested in bright light treatment of depression and trying to understand how light worked. When I saw that patients needed information about light treatment, I wrote a very short book called &#8220;Brighten Your Life&#8221;, but it wasn&#8217;t long enough to publish, so I added information about sleeping pills to make it longer. When we found no publisher for the book, I made the information available at two web sites:  <a href="http://www.BrightenYourLife.info" target="_blank">www.BrightenYourLife.info</a> and <a href="http://www.DarkSideOfSleepingPills.com." target="_blank">www.DarkSideOfSleepingPills.com.</a>  I found that the web site about sleeping pills was more popular than the advice about light treatment&#8211;indeed, one of the most popular sources about sleeping pills at Google.  Therefore, over the years, I have worked to revise and update both web sites to try to help patients.  It costs some money to program and maintain the web sites, but people write me to tell me how they have benefited.  I see so much misinformation coming from the drug companies that I want people to have an alternative source.</p>
<p>Five or six years ago, my friend Dr. Bob Langer was working at the Geisinger Health Research Center, which had access to electronic health records about sleeping pill use from a large number of people. It took us five years to plan a study, obtain approval from ethics committees, retrieve the complex data from computer files in anonymized form, and analyze the very complex results.  When these were published by the medical journal <i>BMJ Open</i>, the new information became available at <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000850.full." target="_blank">http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000850.full.</a>  It is an interesting web site which includes more data in a supplement to the main article and some comments and debate about the article.  The interest in the article was world-wide, with stories on the BBC, at Agence France Press, in major newspapers in Japan, India, and China, and even mentions in far-off places like Myanmar and Ruanda.  The new data showed that people taking drugs such as zolpidem and temazepam had about 4.6 times the mortality rate of people of the same age and sex who took no sleeping pills. The new data confirm that sleeping pills might cause as much death as cigarettes, and also some cancer, so I feel a big responsibility to make the information available.  There may be hundreds of thousands of lives at stake.  People need to know that sleeping pills are too risky to use, and I wish I had more help in telling people.</p>
<p>Recently we updated the <i>Dark Side Of Sleeping Pills</i> and <i>Brighten Your Life</i> and made them available together in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Side-Sleeping-Pills-ebook/dp/B00AECALQC/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357158488&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=daniel+kripke" target="_blank">a Kindle book</a>, which is easy to purchase at Amazon and read off-line.  The books have some new information which we have not yet had a chance to put in the web sites.</p>
<p>Even with, now, more than 20 scientific papers showing that taking sleeping pills is associated with more death and more cancer, many people don&#8217;t believe it. They imagine there is some other explanation, though nobody has been able to demonstrate an alternative explanation.  Of course, statistical association is not quite the same thing as proof of causality, but if it is good enough for the American Cancer Society to advise avoiding cigarettes, it is enough evidence of risk to stay away from sleeping pills, in my opinion. The problem is that the drug companies have never done a controlled trial study large enough to prove one way or another whether the sleeping pills cause death and cancer, and I think they never will.  The cigarette companies have never tried to prove that cigarettes are safe, and they know better than to try.  It is the same.  Whereas the FDA requires the very large studies for heart and diabetes drugs and so forth, the FDA has dropped the ball with sleeping pills.  For more information about that, please see the Kindle book.  There is, however, a new alternative to large, expensive, and dangerous controlled trials called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization" target="_blank">Mendelian randomization</a> study, which uses the new genetic methods to determine causality when a genetic variation causes a risk factor such as sleeping pill usage.  Since the genetic data already exist to do the Mendelian randomization studies, it is a matter of doing the difficult statistical analyses.  I hope scientific colleagues will join in this task, because I can&#8217;t do it by myself.  It is crucial to determine for sure the risks of sleeping pills.  Too many lives are at stake.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sleeping pills are astonishingly dangerous for something that is treated as more or less safe. In some cases, they are associated with a five-fold increase in death rate after only a few years of use. Cigarette smoking is associated with only <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/328/7455/1519" target="_blank">a two- or three-fold increase in death rate after long use</a>. And doctors don&#8217;t prescribe cigarettes. Is there anything else treated as safe that is associated with such a large increase in death rate? I can&#8217;t think of anything. </p>
