				<small>Wednesday, December 28th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Sue Halpern has written the first interesting assessment of Steve Jobs I&#8217;ve seen, in the form of <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/jan/12/who-was-steve-jobs/?pagination=false">a book review of Isaacson&#8217;s biography</a>. It happens to be very negative. She says little about his now-well-known bad treatment of coworkers, friends and family (&#8220;a bully, a dissembler, a cheapskate, a deadbeat dad, a manipulator&#8221;) and focusses on the effects of Apple Computer, which are obviously much greater.</p>
<p>She makes one very bad point. He should not call himself an artist, she argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no doubt that the products Steve Jobs brilliantly conceived of and oversaw at Apple were elegant and beautiful, but they were, in the end, products. Artists, typically, aim to put something of enduring beauty into the world; consumer electronics companies aim to sell a lot of gadgets, manufacturing desire for this year’s model in the hope that people will discard last year’s.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In the end, products&#8221;? &#8220;Gadgets&#8221;? Are books gadgets? I cannot imagine a future without books. Nor one without cellphones and laptops. If they are lovely and work well, so much the better for all of us.  Moreover, cellphones and laptops, much more than other necessities (food, clothes, housing, transportation, medicine) help us express ourselves &#8212; our hidden inner selves &#8212; in so many ways. (Like art and books, but better.) Mark Fraunfelder <a href="http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111006/stories-about-steve/slides/14">made a similar point</a> (obliquely).</p>
<p>&#8220;Products&#8221; and &#8220;gadgets&#8221; is Halpern&#8217;s conventional anti-consumerism. She goes on to make two equally conventional but much better points:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a study reported by Bloomberg News last January, Apple ranked at the very bottom of twenty-nine global tech firms “in terms of responsiveness and transparency to health and environmental concerns in China.” Yet walking into the Foxconn factory, where people routinely work six days a week, from early in the morning till late at night standing in enforced silence, Steve Jobs might have entered his biggest reality distortion field of all. “You go into this place and it’s a factory but, my gosh, they’ve got restaurants and movie theaters and hospitals and swimming pools,” he said after being queried by reporters about working conditions there shortly after a spate of suicides. “For a factory, it’s pretty nice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple had (and has) the power to improve working conditions at Foxconn. I completely agree: this was (and is) an enormous missed opportunity, for which Steve Jobs is completely responsible. No doubt he said that Apple products empower individuals (and they do) &#8212; well, how about empowering Foxconn workers?</p>
<p>Halpern&#8217;s final point is about recycling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Next year will bring the iPhone 5, and a new MacBook, and more iPods and iMacs. What this means is that somewhere in the third world, poor people are picking through heaps of electronic waste in an effort to recover bits of gold and other metals and maybe make a dollar or two. Piled high and toxic, it is leaking poisons and carcinogens like lead, cadmium, and mercury that leach into their skin, the ground, the air, the water. Such may be the longest-lasting legacy of Steve Jobs’s art.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Apple could (and can) lead the world in making their products easy to recycle. They haven&#8217;t. Entirely Steve Jobs&#8217; fault. As Halpern says, this really matters.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs spent his working life (a) exploiting the commercial potential of new products (home computer, etc.) in large part by (b) caring obsessively, much more than others in his rarefied position, such as Bill Gates, about how they made him feel. Apple made products that Steve Jobs enjoyed. Fine. The problem is what Steve Jobs enjoyed. My take on him is a lot can be explained by (a) he cared little what others thought of him and (b) he lived in a tiny, uncomplicated intellectual world &#8212; as illustrated by his remarks about Foxconn and his Stanford graduation speech. Nabokov might say he had the emotional development of a child and the curiosity of an adult.</p>
<p>He left behind a company that reflects the shallowness of what he cared about. Those who take over Apple Computer are likely to be less shallow than he was &#8212; most people are. I predict the company will begin to care more about working conditions, ease of recycling, and other things beyond immediate user experience.</p>

<li>The Shangri-La Diet: <strong>still</strong> <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111005151654AAX8TLC">too good to be true</a>. It was my dream &#8212; and maybe every scientist&#8217;s dream &#8212; to discover something (a) useful and (b) counter-intuitive, the more surprising the better. It did not occur to me that (a) and (b) conflict. I think that more surprising discoveries are eventually more useful (as logic suggests), but it takes much longer.</li>

Neither did I. Likewise, the recent Murakami story <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2011/09/05/110905fi_fiction_murakami">Town of Cats</a> was from a forthcoming book. <em>The New Yorker</em>, unlike other magazines, never identifies book excerpts. This  is unfortunate because doing so would help both writers (sell books) and readers (find books to read). For more criticism of  <em>The New Yorker</em>, see the great book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gone-Last-Days-New-Yorker/dp/0684808161"><em>Gone</em>: <em>The Last Days of The New Yorker</em> by Renata Adler</a>.</li>

					<p><a href="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/">Edward Jay Epstein</a>&#8216;s newest Kindle book is <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/James-Jesus-Angleton-Original-ebook/dp/B005LPE5SC">James Jesus Angleton: Was He Right?</a></em>. Angleton worked at the CIA most of his career, which spanned the Cold War. He struck some of his colleagues as paranoid: He believed that the CIA could easily contain Russian spies. Colleagues said <em>Oh, no, that couldn&#8217;t happen</em>. After his death, it turned out he was right (e.g., Aldrich Ames). At one point he warned the CIA director, &#8220;an intelligence [agency] is most vulnerable to deception when it considers itself invulnerable to deception.&#8221; </p>
<p>What interests me is the asymmetry of the mistakes. When it really matters, we overestimate far more than underestimate our understanding. CIA employees&#8217; overestimation of their ability to detect deception is a big example. There are innumerable small examples. When people are asked to guess everyday facts (e.g., height of the Empire State Building) and provide 95% confidence intervals for their guesses, their intervals are too short, usually much too short (e.g., the correct answer is outside the intervals 20% of the time). People arrive at destinations more often later than expected than earlier than expected. Projects large and small take longer than expected far more often than shorter than expected. For any one example, there are many possible explanations. But the diversity of examples suggests the common thread is true: We are too sure of what we know.</p>
<p>There are several plausible explanations. One is that it helps groups work together. If people work together toward a single goal, they are more likely to reach that goal and at least learn what happens than if they squabble. Another is the same idea at an individual level. Overconfidence in our beliefs helps us act on them. By acting on them, we learn. Doing nothing teaches less. A third is a mismatch idea: We are overconfident because modern life is more complicated than the Stone-Age world to which evolution adjusted our brains. No one asked Stone-Age people <em>How tall is the Empire State Building?</em> A fourth is that we assume what physicists assume: the distant world follows the same rules as the world close to us. This is a natural assumption, but it&#8217;s wrong. </p>
<p>Early in Angleton&#8217;s career, he had a very unpleasant shock: He realized he had been fooled by the Russians in a big way for a long time. This led him to try to understand why he&#8217;d been fooled. Early in my scientific career, I too was shocked: Rats in Skinner boxes did not act as expected far more often than I would have thought. I overestimated my understanding of them. In a heavily-controlled heavily-studied situation! I generalized from this. If I couldn&#8217;t predict the behavior of rats in a Skinner box, I couldn&#8217;t predict human behavior  in ordinary life. My conclusion was <strong>data is more precious than we think</strong>. In other words, data is underpriced. If a stock is underpriced, you buy as much of it as possible. I tried to collect as much data as possible. Personal science &#8212; studying my sleep, my weight, and so on &#8212; was a way to gather data at essentially zero cost. And, indeed, the results surprised me far more than I expected. I could <strong>act</strong> based on the overconfidence effect but I could not remove it from my expectations.</p>

					<p>Yesterday was the first day of one of my Tsinghua classes. It has about 25 students. I asked each of them to say their favorite book in English. Several were mentioned twice: <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (mentioned three times), <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>, <em>The Little Prince</em>, and &#8212; this surprised me &#8212; <em>The Secret</em>. The last student to answer this question said her favorite book was <em>Lolita. </em>The class oohed. Last year a student said his favorite book was <em>Ulysses</em>. I said my favorite book was <a href="http://www.portifex.com/BSPages/Cities&amp;Wealth.htm"><em>Cities and the Wealth of Nations</em></a>. (A close second is <a href="http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/Tottochan.pdf"><em>Totto-Chan</em></a>.)</p>

					<p>I loved Ned Zeman&#8217;s new book <em><a href="http://therulesofthetunnel.com/">The Rules of the Tunnel</a></em>, which I read during a long plane flight. Not only does it combine three of my favorite subjects &#8212; high-end magazines, bipolar disorder, and the crappiness of modern psychiatry &#8212; but it&#8217;s very well-written and revealing. I haven&#8217;t enjoyed a book so much in a long time. </p>
<p>Zeman once wrote for <em>Spy</em>, as did I. Long ago, I met him at a <em>Spy</em> party. I suppose I could have gotten a free copy of his book but I bought it. I wanted something great to read on the plane.</p>

					<p>Ann Beattie, a great writer, has a new book out called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/books/review/Shulevitz-t.html?pagewanted=2&#038;_r=1&#038;nl=books&#038;emc=booksupdateema3"><em>The New Yorker Stories</em></a>. I loved her early stories. Her first story in <em>The New Yorker</em> (1974) was &#8220;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1974/04/08/1974_04_08_042_TNY_CARDS_000311683">A Platonic Relationship</a>&#8220;. I still remember this:</p>
<blockquote><p>When he did have a beer he would take one bottle from the case and put it in the refrigerator and wait for it to get cold, and then drink it. . . . One night Sam asked her if she would like a beer. . . . He went to his room and took out a bottle and put it in the refrigerator. &#8220;It will be cold in a while,&#8221; he said quietly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last night I put a Diet Coke in the freezer. <em>It will be cold in a while,</em> I thought, remembering this passage.</p>
<p>Alas, I haven&#8217;t liked her work over the last 20 years as much, although I am looking forward to reading <em>Walks With Men</em>, her latest novel.</p>

					<p>Someone asked Lydia Davis: <em>Why another translation of Madame Bovary?</em> <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/09/15/why-a-new-madame-bovary/">She replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the case of a book that appeared more than 150 years ago, like <em>Madame Bovary</em>,  and that is an important landmark in the history of the novel, there is  room for plenty of different English versions. For example, 1) the  first editions of the original text may have been faulty, and over the  years one or more corrected editions have been published, so that the  earliest English translations no longer match the most accurate  original; 2) the earliest translators (as was the case with the Muirs  rendering Kafka) may have felt they needed to inflict subtle or not so  subtle alterations on the style and even the content of the original so  as to make it more acceptable to the Anglophone audience; with the  passing of time, we come to deem this something of a betrayal and ask  for a more faithful version. 3) Earlier versions may simply not be as  good in other respects as they could beâ€”let another translator have a  try.</p></blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/10/22/why-small-improvement-big-deal/">my three-part answer</a> to the question a journalist asked me: why it mattered that butter improved my arithmetic speed by 5%.</p>
<p>Just as I disliked my answer, I disliked Davis&#8217;s answer. It&#8217;s hypothetical (&#8220;may have been faulty&#8221;, &#8220;may have felt&#8221;, &#8220;may not be as good as they could be&#8221;). It&#8217;s flat and obvious (earlier versions may have room for improvement). It&#8217;s irrelevant (bad translation of Kafka does not justify new translation of Flaubert).</p>
<p>I had trouble figuring out a better answer to what I was asked, but I could instantly say what Davis should have written: The story of how she decided to do a new translation. (&#8220;I began to think about doing a new translation when . . . &#8220;) That would have been a lot more emotion-laden and not hypothetical, obvious, or irrelevant.</p>
<p>As soon as I thought what Davis should have said, I could see what I should have said. I should have answered the journalist&#8217;s question like this: <em>Why does 5% matter? Let me tell you why I was so excited by this. . . .Â  </em></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today was my first day of class at Tsinghua. I am teaching a seminar called Frontiers of Psychology. There was only time for about half of the 40-odd students to identify themselves, which included saying their favorite book. Three girls said their favorite book is <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. Two said <em>The Little Prince</em>. One said <em>Harry Potter</em>. One said <em>Rebecca</em> by Daphne Du Marier (published 1938). One boy said he didn&#8217;t have a favorite book &#8212; reading books was a waste of time. One boy said his favorite book is <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>Most of them, perhaps 80%, chose a non-Chinese book as their favorite. One French, two German, the rest English (which they may have read in Chinese translation). At first I was surprised but then I realized it made sense. Chinese civilization was more advanced than European civilization for a long time but when Gutenberg invented the Western version of the printing press everything changed. In Europe, unlike China, books became cheap and literacy spread. With literacy came a book industry. A large number of Europeans have been reading books for 500 years. In contrast, the Chinese language, with thousands of characters (in contrast to 26 lower-case and 26 upper-case letters) made printing difficult. With reading material rare, so was literacy.</p>

				<small>Sunday, June 27th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Daniel Carlat, a Massachusetts psychiatrist, is the author of the excellent blog <a href="http://carlatpsychiatry.blogspot.com/">The Carlat Psychiatry Blog</a>. He also wrote <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/magazine/25memoir-t.html?scp=1&#038;sq=daneil%20carlat&#038;st=cse">an excellent article in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em></a> about working on the side as a drug rep: He told other psychiatrists about new drugs. He quit (or was fired) because telling the truth wasn&#8217;t compatible with the job.</p>
<p><em>Unhinged</em>, his new book (sent to me by the publisher after I asked for it twice &#8212; that&#8217;s how much I wanted to read it), covers the same ground. Its subtitle (or two subtitles) is/are <em>The Trouble With Psychiatry &#8212; A Doctor&#8217;s Revelations about a Profession in Crisis</em>. The contents were well-written, but none of it was new to me: the &#8220;chemical imbalance&#8221; theory of depression is a convenient myth, how drug reps work, how drug companies influence doctors, diagnosis difficulties, the cases of Charles Nemeroff and the like. (I did learn that Nemeroff was called &#8220;the boss of bosses&#8221; because of his prominence and power.) If any of his criticisms are new to you, this book is a great introduction. He uses many stories of patients to make his points.</p>
<p>Overall, I found theÂ book too calm. What Nemeroff and others like him did I find outrageous but Carlat doesn&#8217;t sound outraged. Maybe he is, I have no idea, but his book is more reasonable-sounding than scornful and I would have preferred scornful. At one point he says he wrote <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/opinion/09carlat.html?_r=1&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=%22makers%20of%20sleeping%20pills%20are%20now%20paying%22&#038;st=cse">an &#8220;angry&#8221; op-ed</a> for the <em>New York Times </em>about something and I thought: <em>good, some emotion!Â </em></p>
<p>The <em>crisis </em>of the subtitle (&#8220;A profession in crisis&#8221;) is enticing but is not borne out by the contents. Carlat dislikes aspects X, Y, and Z of his profession, but one person&#8217;s dissatisfaction does not equal crisis. I saw no signs he is part of a growing movement. My take on the trouble with psychiatry is that psychiatrists don&#8217;t understand what is wrong in almost every case they see and, due to lack of understanding, do a poor job of fixing the problem. Lack of understanding by doctors is nothing new and, until someone has a better understanding, doesn&#8217;t pose a professional problem. This basic truth goes unmentioned in <em>Unhinged</em>.</p>

					<p>I have yet to see Matt Ridley&#8217;s new book <em>The Rational Optimist</em>, which is related to <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">stuff I&#8217;ve said about human evolution</a>. But <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/jun/18/matt-ridley-rational-optimist-errors">George Monbiot seems to consider it damning</a> that Ridley was chairman of the bank Northern Rock when it failed. Bailout of Northern Rock was an example of government intervention &#8212; which <em>The Rational Optimist</em> is against, Monbiot says. Hey, why not attack Ridley for drinking government-supplied water from the tap in his kitchen? What a hypocrite!</p>

				<small>Tuesday, April 27th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes, the king is naked but only a little girl says so. The king&#8217;s advisers don&#8217;t tell him. I suppose the intended lesson was that powerful people have trouble getting frank answers. That&#8217;s pretty obvious. For a CEO, it&#8217;s said, the scarcest commodity is truth. Bosses learn this all the time. I learned it the first time I asked one of my students what he thought of the class.</p>
<p>Andersen&#8217;s story can be taken differently, partly conveyed by the phrase <em>elephant in the room</em>: Something big and important is overlooked by the supposed experts (in the story, the king&#8217;s advisers). It should be obvious &#8212; but it isn&#8217;t. Or at least no one says anything. This is how Harry Markopolos used the term <em>emperor&#8217;s new clothes</em> in <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/24/harry-markopolos-meet-stephen-mcintyre/"><em>No One Would Listen</em></a>: Madoff was a gigantic fraud, his returns were (to Markopolos) clearly too good to be true, he was enormously visible (in certain circles), but no one said anything. It was as astonishing as a king parading naked. <em>How come no one sees this?</em> Markopolos thought. If you looked at Madoff the right way, he was naked.</p>
<p>That this sort of thing happens isn&#8217;t obvious at all. Yet three books &#8212; which I&#8217;ve just blogged about &#8212; have recently appeared with examples. One is the Markopolos book. Another is <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/22/the-hockey-stick-illusion/"><em>The Hockey Stick Illusion</em></a>. Surely there&#8217;s overwhelming evidence that humans are causing global warming, right? Well, no. The only clear evidence was that hockey stick &#8212; and that&#8217;s a statistical artifact. (It <em>looks</em> like an artifact.) The third is <em><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/26/the-big-short/">The Big Short</a></em>. It wasn&#8217;t easy to find the right sight line from which it was clear that Goldman Sachs et al. were taking on far more risk than they realized but such views existed. I call these books The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes Trilogy. Their broad lesson: <strong>Sometimes the &#8220;best people&#8221; aren&#8217;t right. Sometimes there&#8217;s a point of view from which they&#8217;re glaringly wrong</strong>. <em>The Hockey Stick Illusion</em> is about how Stephen McIntyre found this point of view. In <em>No One Would Listen</em> Markopolos found this point of view. In <em>The Big Short</em> several people found this point of view.</p>
<p>This relates to my self-experimentation in two ways. First, the &#8220;best people&#8221; say self-experimentation is bad. No weight-control researcher does self-experimentation. No sleep researcher does self-experimentation. Surely they know how to do research. It&#8217;s their job. Whereas to me it&#8217;s glaringly obvious that self-experimentation is an excellent research tool, not just because of <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">my results</a> but also because it makes it so much easier to try new things. The best way to learn is to do, IÂ  believe; self-experimentation makes doing much easier. Second, my self-experimentation uncovered all sorts of results that implied that the expert consensus on this or that was glaringly wrong. The Shangri-La Diet is just one example. Breakfast is good, right? Well, no, breakfast may wake you up too early. And so on. At first, I didn&#8217;t grasp the broad lesson I stated earlier (&#8220;Sometimes the &#8220;best people&#8221; aren&#8217;t right. . . &#8220;) and was amazed by what I was finding. To me, The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes Trilogy is support.</p>

				<small>Monday, April 26th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>The Big Short</em> (sent to me by the publisher) is Michael Lewis&#8217;s best book, and that&#8217;s saying a lot. <em>Moneyball </em>was excellent<em>. The Blind Side </em>was excellent. All three are stories of underdog triumph but <em>The Big Short </em>is about a far more important subject, a far more complicated subject, and has a tremendously dark side. You know the saying: <em>Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me</em>. Well, shame on Wall Street for creating the worst financial disaster ever. But then, as Nassim Taleb puts it, the school-bus driver who crashed a bus full of children were <em>given a new bus</em>. Those who created the disaster were put in charge of fixing it. As Steve Eisman, one of Lewis&#8217;s main characters, puts it, &#8220;I can understand why Goldman Sachs would want to be included in the conversation about what to do about Wall Street. What I can&#8217;t understand is why anyone would listen to them.&#8221; (Not just listen. They were allowed to dominate the conversation.) Showing that the foolishness of people at the top in American society has no clear limit.</p>
<p>I could hardly stop reading. Endless fascinating detail. Michael Burry, another main character, discovers he has Asperger&#8217;s after his son is turned down by several kindergartens and he tries to understand why. I&#8217;ve been talking and reading about data analysis my whole professional life, yet Lewis&#8217;s story about how means can be terribly misleading is the best I&#8217;ve heard. An average credit score of 600 can be due to two scores of 600 or to scores of 500 and 700, with vastly different consequences. (This escaped the averagers.) Sure, I knew about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/opinion/26krugman.html?hp">the conflict of interest of bond rating agencies</a>, such as Moody&#8217;s, but Lewis describes it so well I loved reading about it again.</p>
<p>Long ago, I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/01/24/not-the-same-study-section-how-the-truth-comes-out/">blogged about the importance of insider/outsiders</a> &#8212; close enough to understand what&#8217;s going on yet far enough away to see the truth. Lewis&#8217;s heros, who saw that a tremendous crash was coming, are exactly that. Like <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/24/harry-markopolos-meet-stephen-mcintyre/">Harry Markopolos</a>, they were on the fringes of the financial industry. One of them (Eisman) had a gift for tactlessness, another (Burry) had Asperger&#8217;s, and a third group ran their fund from a Berkeley garage. Without them, the people at the top (e.g., the head of Goldman Sachs), who run and crashed our financial system, could plausibly say <em>Nobody could have predicted this</em>. Because of Lewis&#8217;s heros, they can&#8217;t.</p>
