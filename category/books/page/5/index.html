					<p>The subtitle of <a href="http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13642306">Paul Midler&#8217;s book</a> is &#8220;An Insider&#8217;s Account of the Tactics Behind China&#8217;s Production Game.&#8221; Midler is an American who helps American and European companies get stuff made in China. The book is about how, in a dozen ways, Chinese manufacturers manage to make manufacturing deals more profitable to them at the expense of their customer &#8212; and, often, the ultimate consumer. Most of the book is about what happens to an unnamed American company that imports &#8220;telephone numbers&#8221; of beauty products. One problem is &#8220;quality fade.&#8221; The product slowly gets worse until the importer objects. For example, at one point the fragrance put in liquid soap was changed. Instead of different fragrances for products with different labels, almond was used in every case. So a product labeled Aloe Vera smelled of almond. (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/03/07/hey-what-happened-to-my-brain-part-1/">I discovered I couldn&#8217;t trust flaxseed oil made in China.</a>)</p>
<p>A friend of mine became a vegetarian after working at Burger King. Midler had a similar conversion:</p>
<blockquote><p>I found myself losing faith in all sorts of products manufactured in China. I was soon careful to purchase health and beauty products that were not made by local [i.e., Chinese] companies, but by large, multinational corporations &#8212; but then I realized the body wash I had been using, while it was made by a reputable global company, was actually manufactured in a plant located in South China. . . . I knew these production managers well. . . . They believed that what a customer didn&#8217;t know couldn&#8217;t hurt him.</p>
<p>I found myself using less body wash, eventually relying on only hot water for my showers. When no one seemed to notice the difference, I stopped using the wash altogether. And then I stopped using soap, as well. . . . <em>Why take any chances? </em></p></blockquote>
<p>The attitude of <em>cheat your customer as much as possible</em> isn&#8217;t a great long-term strategy, as Chinese manufacturers are learning &#8212; the situation used to be even worse. A friend of mine analyzes the situation like this: For a long time Chinese were taught Confucianism. When the Communists took over, that changed to<em> The state is God</em>. Now that system of morality is gone, but nothing&#8217;s replaced it. In <em>Systems of Survival</em>, Jane Jacobs wrote about two systems of morality, a &#8220;guardian syndrome&#8221; and a &#8220;commercial syndrome.&#8221; The commercial syndrome, appropriate for trading, placed great weight on honesty. (The guardian syndrome, in contrast, placed great weight on loyalty.) Behind Jacobs&#8217;s classification was the implication that these syndromes had evolved because they worked better than other possibilities.</p>
<p><em>Poorly Made in China</em> was easy to read. It has those two essential elements: it&#8217;s a series of stories, long and short; and the author feels strongly about his topic.</p>

					<p>I completely agree with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/20ventura.html?em">Ray Bradbury about libraries</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œLibraries raised me,â€ Mr. Bradbury said. â€œI donâ€™t believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students donâ€™t have any money. When I graduated from high school, it was during the Depression and we had no money. I couldnâ€™t go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what he says about a similar source of free knowledge:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œThe Internet is a big distraction,â€ Mr. Bradbury barked . . . â€œYahoo called me eight weeks ago,â€ he said, voice rising. â€œThey wanted to put a book of mine on Yahoo! You know what I told them? â€˜To hell with you. To hell with you and to hell with the Internet.â€™</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s distracting,â€ he continued. â€œItâ€™s meaningless; itâ€™s not real. Itâ€™s in the air somewhere.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>When I was in college (at Caltech), I didn&#8217;t find classes <em>or</em> books very helpful. I liked reading old <em>New Yorker </em>articles. Which then I got from the library but now I&#8217;d get online.</p>

					<p>I have tried a dozen-odd ways of learning Chinese. Few of them have worked very well . . . except one: the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tuttle-Learning-Chinese-Characters-Revolutionary/dp/080483816X/sethrobertand-20"><em>Learning Chinese Characters</em></a> (2007) by Alison Matthews and Laurence Matthews. The subtitle is &#8220;a revolutionary new way to learn and remember the 800 most basic Chinese characters&#8221; and I agree, if <em>revolutionary </em>means &#8220;a lot better than other methods&#8221;. The method is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break combination characters &#8212; almost all Chinese characters are combinations of a few hundred simpler characters &#8212; into components.</li>
<li>The simplest components, not divisible into others, are associated with a picture that conveys the meaning. Someone pitching a baseball, for example, when outlined makes the character for <strong>nine</strong>.</li>
<li>Devise a brief story, a little picture, to help you remember that the components together mean what they mean. For example, the characters for <strong>white </strong>and <strong>ladle </strong>put together in one character mean <strong>of</strong>. The story is something like: &#8220;Look at that <strong>white ladle</strong>. It&#8217;s the special ladle <strong>of </strong>Chef Thomas. The book is full of drawings to help visualize the stories.</li>
</ol>
<p>I enjoy reading it. Partly for the feeling of accomplishment &#8212; I can tell I am actually learning the characters much faster than before &#8212; and partly because the combinations are intriguing.</p>
<p>The book I have says &#8220;Volume One&#8221; so I eagerly await later volumes to read more of what these two writers, who are not identified, have to say. I never saw it in Beijing; I came across it in a Barnes &#038; Noble or Borders.</p>

<p>Around 1996, Borders opened a bookstore in Singapore. With about 50,000 books, it was much larger than any existing bookstore on the island. Freight cost about $1/book, a big improvement over the shipping costs if you bought a book online. Singapore, of course, is a very crowded place. Space was precious. You couldn&#8217;t own a lot of books because you didn&#8217;t have much space. One result was books were sold shrink-wrapped. The Borders books, however, were not shrink-wrapped. A great bookstore is like a great library &#8212; but only if the books aren&#8217;t shrink-wrapped. The first customers in the Singapore Borders would bring a book to the front desk and ask for the shrink-wrapped copy. But there was no shrink-wrapped copy.</p>
<p>Singapore newspapers started editorializing about how to behave in the new bookstore: <em>Careful with the books</em>. Handle them gently. They were trying to acclimate their readers to non-shrink-wrapped books. Why did editorial writers throw their weight behind a new business? Bruce Quinnell, the head of Borders at the time, thinks it is because they thought the new bookstore was such a wonderful thing. Thousands and thousands of books that had never before been on that island. Books are a commercial product but no other commercial product would inspire such a response.</p>
<p>The Singapore Borders was a huge success, at one point leading the entire chain in sales, and as far as I know is still thriving.</p>

					<p><em><a href="http://www.uncharitable.net/">Uncharitable: How Restraints on Nonprofits Undermine Their Potential</a> </em>by Dan Pallotta is more a howl than a book. I enjoyed opening it at random, reading a few pages, agreeing with the author that the current situation is idiotic, and then going back to whatever I was doing. It is too repetitive to read sequentially but read in bits it makes a lot of sense. His big point is that nonprofits are forced to operate under weird moralistic constraints that do no one any good &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s right. The main benefit of those moralistic constraints &#8212; <em>no one must profit from charity!</em> for example &#8212; is that the moralizers feel good. The charities are badly damaged. And the charities are self-destructive, too. After Pallotta&#8217;s company ran highly successful 3-day Breast Cancer walks for several years, the Avon Products Foundation, which benefited from these walks, decided they could do better themselves. After a year (2002) in which Pallott&#8217;s company raised $140 million, Avon themselves ran a similar event for four years (2003-2006) during which they raised about $60 million/year.</p>

					<p>ROBERTSÂ  How is it possible that Cal Techâ€™s basketball team was considered better than UCLAâ€™s basketball team in the 1950s? That was the part I was amazed at.</p>
<p>MLODINOW At least the early part of the decade.Â  That was harder to understand than the Girl Named Florida Problem. I think in those days basketball was nothing&#8211;imagine saying that the Cal Tech curling team is better than the UCLA curling team. Since nobody really cares about curling itâ€™s just a quaint fact that someone at Cal Tech, probably in the faculty, would care about curling well enough to organize a team. Maybe Iâ€™m exaggerating a little bit, but in the 50s I think it was a much different sport and a much different sports world. Not to belittle their team; I think they had some really good players from the looks of it and maybe Cal Tech cared more about recruiting players for sports than they do today. Maybe our world in general is a little looser about things and you could invest the time to play sports more even if you were at a high-powered place like Cal Tech; not to be as pressured&#8211;to just study. I guess it was just a different world in some ways&#8211;a nice world&#8211;back then that could happen. Now college basketball is just a huge and money generating industry that no one would allow a school like Cal Tech&#8211;by allow it I donâ€™t mean that thereâ€™s some individual disallowing it but the world will not allow, itâ€™s not loose enough to allow, a school thatâ€™s not completely focused on that sport to have a good team in that sport. Everything is too high-powered today.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes. Of all the things in your book, that was the most staggering.</p>
<p>MLODINOW You should see the movie Quantum Hoops; itâ€™s a documentary about the Cal Tech basketball team. I recommend it.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I didnâ€™t know there was such a movie.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Itâ€™s on DVD; Iâ€™m thinking it must be available from NetFlix.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, Iâ€™ll get it.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Itâ€™s very amusing&#8211;it is for me because of my connection to Cal Tech&#8211;but I think for the general public, itâ€™s a very amusing film.</p>
<p>ROBERTS We were talking about unexpected things. If you looked at the Cal Tech basketball team, if you just looked at basketball in the 1950s, you would think, â€˜Well, Cal Tech&#8211;thatâ€™s as it should be.â€™ But then all of the sudden, 20 years later, itâ€™s so very different.</p>
<p>MLODINOW I think in those days it was more like a club, like a sport, like what you think of as a kidsâ€™ fun activity and now the athletes for basketball are heavily recruited and bribed in one way or another, and the huge amounts of money at stake for the school for them. Itâ€™s a totally different calculus and itâ€™s sad in a way, isnâ€™t it? I think everything is like that today.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I guess what Iâ€™m saying is that there was something&#8211;youâ€™re in the 1950s, itâ€™s 1956&#8211;very few people saw that there was something hidden in basketball that could lead to what it became.</p>
<p>MLODINOW And if you were the superstar of that time you also didnâ€™t get the rewards of what became today and itâ€™s a little bit late for you now, right? I know in the bathroom in the Cal Tech cafeteria there was a framed article about him, I canâ€™t remember his name, one of the superstars of the 50s who was one of the best basketball players to ever live&#8211;I think they claim that even today&#8211;who basically probably never even made a living from it, or not a good living.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, that kind of brings us back to the very beginning. I feel like somehow the times have changed and people are smarter. Now you can make a living from what youâ€™re doing. Youâ€™re writing this very entertaining intellectual history; finally thereâ€™s a market for it. Finally people are smart enough to be at your level so that you can write a book that you respect but you can get a wide enough audience.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Are you saying that in the 50s that couldnâ€™t have been done? I donâ€™t know.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Well, nobody did it; letâ€™s put it that way.</p>
<p>MLODINOW No, nobody did it. I donâ€™t know why.</p>
<p>ROBERTS As I said before we started recording, youâ€™re the first person to ever do this. Will you be the last? I donâ€™t know but youâ€™re the first. Youâ€™re the first person to write intellectual histories that actually are popular and that people want to read, that theyâ€™re not forced to read by their teachers. Itâ€™s not just a tiny group of people reading them. Professors of course write them but theyâ€™re not well written and itâ€™s just their job to write them; they get a salary from the government to write those books. Youâ€™re not getting any salary. Youâ€™re an entrepreneur and itâ€™s just so different. Your books have to be popular or your job goes away. Itâ€™s just a different level of competence; your books are just infinitely more accessible, infinitely better than a professor would normally write. A professor is subsidized and thatâ€™s what is basically comes down to. Practically everybody who writes about science is subsidized but youâ€™re not.</p>
<p>When the TV show The Simpson came along I would talk about IQ scores in my class and I talk about the fact that they had been rising and so forth. And I say, â€˜Well you know there is evidence that people are getting smarter and one example is The Simpsons; this is at a higher level than other TV shows that came before it.â€™ Now maybe thatâ€™s not so important, how intelligent is an animated show, but I think what youâ€™re doing is very important and I think it may be a sign of increased intelligence. Thereâ€™s enough of a market now for what youâ€™re doing. There wasnâ€™t before.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Iâ€™m certainly glad that there is and that people appreciate the way I put things.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Iâ€™m glad because that means you can do so much more of it.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes, and I look forward to that. Itâ€™s a great privilege to be able to do that.</p>
<p>ROBERTS When I was a freshman at Cal Tech I was always looking for books like yours but they just didnâ€™t exist. So I ended up reading The New Yorker for my intellectual history. That was very narrow; they never did a good job of covering science. They never talked about geometry or DeMoivre, Laplace, or Gauss. They didnâ€™t cover those people. But those people are important. But you do; finally we have someone. Itâ€™s great.</p>

					<p>MLODINOW As I start talking about events in the world around us and looking at the psychological components&#8211;and I dealt with that, I greatly expanded that part&#8211;they were fascinating studies and I was just so interested I just kept putting more and more into the book.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, thatâ€™s when you decided to ask me for help. &#8220;Oh, I wasnâ€™t planning on this.&#8221; How did you learn about the lottery winner who won twice&#8211;the Canadian?</p>
<p>MLODINOW It was in a book somewhere, an academic book. A lot of those interesting stories came from academic papers or books.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Thatâ€™s interesting.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Sometimes Iâ€™ll find something in the newspaper that was really interesting and I would track it down but a lot of it was in academic research. I donâ€™t know why they found it.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, who knows where they got it, but thatâ€™s where you got it. How did you learn about the Girl Named Florida stuff? Some professor told you?</p>
<p>MLODINOW My friend Mark Hillery that I mentioned from Berkeley.</p>
<p>ROBERTS A physics professor.</p>
<p>MLODINOW He heard it somewhere&#8230; It wasnâ€™t quite this problem but then I kind of tweaked it and made it the Girl Named Florida Problem. Thatâ€™s a great problem for the book.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, I loved that. So he got it from some physicist . . .</p>
<p>MLODINOW Iâ€™m not sure; probably. I took a few days to figure out how to make it into this problem; I donâ€™t remember exactly the problem he told me but I tweaked it into this problem. Just to show you how much work goes into the book, I even spent a whole afternoon deciding on the name Florida. I went back into the records&#8211;I needed a rare name&#8211;and I looked up different names and tried to find one that would be colorful, interesting, but that was rarely used, and I wanted to know the percentage that it was used; I dug up percentages of names. Everything in the book . . . if you read it, it might just sound like, â€˜Oh, you knowâ€™ . . .</p>
<p>Not a thing is just tossed out there. Or very little; thereâ€™s an amazing amount of thought and work that goes behind every little detail.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Thatâ€™s a very memorable detail I must say. I like it better than the Monty Hall Problem.</p>
<p>MLODINOW I do, too. I think itâ€™s interesting; I found in the reactions to the book that the Monty Hall Problem has gotten more press and in some ways more reactions, which I found interesting given that it has been talked about before and this problem was completely new. I think this problem is in some ways even more striking than the Monty Hall Problem, more counterintuitive and more difficult to believe and certainly closer to something you might actually encounter. And yet Iâ€™ve gotten a lot more response based on the Monty Hall Problem and a few places have said that I gave the best explanation theyâ€™ve seen. I think the New York Times review said that, too. The New York Times did mention the Girl Named Florida Problem and said that they still find it hard to believe even though they followed the explanation.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I thought your explanation of the Girl Named Florida problem was very clear.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>ROBERTS Did the psychology stuff grow and grow? Did you add more and more than you expected?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes. As I was putting a lot of it in the end I would find other studies that really belonged earlier that I would discover, so I would go back and rewrite the earlier parts to incorporate those studies; that became a very fun part of the book, though. That was maybe the most fun, all the psychology studies that I dug out at the end.</p>
<p>ROBERTS How did it happen? You knew that you wanted to include some psychology and then it turned out to be more interesting than you expected?</p>
<p>MLODINOW In the second half of the book when I was talking more and more about viewing life as a random process that weâ€™re going through and applying the concepts of randomness to what weâ€™re seeing in life, I would just naturally come upon these psychology studies.</p>
<p>ROBERTS What fraction of the psychology you read was in the book? I was impressed that you talked about psychology studies that were really good, whereas most of them arenâ€™t. You did a good job of selection and from teaching I know that you have to read a lot of stuff that isnâ€™t good in order to find the good stuff.</p>
<p>MLODINOW What you see in the book is probably a quarter of the stuff that I read or that I thought of putting in the book. In the psychology studies maybe half of them made it into the book and I think I was good at filtering before I even read by following trails of one study leading to other studies and using either textbooks or compilation conference reports to figure out what would be good and what wouldnâ€™t be so good.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m talking about half of the studies where I actually bothered to copy the papers; there are other ones, countless studies, where I would get to the abstract and dismiss it after reading the abstract or one page. That I have no way of counting, thatâ€™s just constant; maybe ten times as many. But the ones that I actually got to where I made copies . . . if I like something I will print it out because I just canâ€™t read dozens of pages on the screen and plus I like to sit in cafÃ©s and carry it around. I guess I could bring my laptop but I tend to print them out. About half of the ones I bothered to print out I put in the book and then there were countless ones that I just dismissed.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, I see what you mean. How did the bookâ€™s structure differ from your original proposal? Did the structure change very much?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes; I donâ€™t remember exactly, but it did. The first chapter was not there in the proposal; the proposal started with chapter two. Then I realized that I needed an introductory chapter to really set the stage for why weâ€™re interested in these things so for introductory chapter, which is applications to life, I start by analyzing certain situations in life that I think are surprising that people misinterpret; I thought that was a good lead-in as to why we care about this. Then I went into other chapters about developing the ideas of randomness and a lot of that was similar to the proposal although I put in less about Brownian motion and the actual drunkardâ€™s walk itself than I think it had in there. The last several chapters, I extended the discussion about life; I think the middle part of the book is fairly similar to the proposal but the beginning and the end I expanded greatly on discussions of the everyday world and applications; the psychology was not in the original proposal nearly at the level that it was in the final book.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, I see what you mean.</p>
<p>MLODINOW . . . again, as I start talking about events in the world around us and looking at the psychological components&#8211;and I dealt with that, I greatly expanded that part&#8211;they were fascinating studies and I was just so interested I just kept putting more and more into the book.</p>

<p>True. I have never heard a book publisher or editor notice that almost all important books have been written by amateurs. Charles Darwin didn&#8217;t write books for a living. Nor did Thomas Paine. Nor did Betty Friedan. I think this is why books have been so influential.</p>

					<p>ROBERTS I have some questions about details of the book. What was the hardest part of writing the book? . . . there were no hard parts?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Well, Iâ€™m thinking about it and also thinking about how I interpret the word â€˜hard.â€™ Usually â€˜hardâ€™ would mean that youâ€™re struggling with it and Iâ€™m not sure I exactly struggled with any particular part, in a sense of . . . with all the negative connotations of the word â€˜struggle,â€™ where Iâ€™m unsure of victory and battling and becoming exhausted and fear for my life.</p>
<p>I guess the part that comes to mind that I had the most doubts about whether I could get through it was the structure of the book because it weaves together three areas that are historically not that smoothly tied together&#8211;probability, statistics and the random processes. Or one united subject, like geometry, that you can see the fairly linear development and here it was more intertwined strands. I did have some trouble at first seeing the segue both in concept and tone of the book, from probability to statistics and at the end when Iâ€™m talking more about random processes and very specifically about peoplesâ€™ lives. To make that a smooth transition so it doesnâ€™t seem like two books, a book on the concepts and another book on peoplesâ€™ lives. There was a lot about peoplesâ€™ lives in the earlier parts, too, but in the latter parts of the book, I had less and less actual mathematical concepts and almost solely psychology and sociology and discussion of peoplesâ€™ lives. Figuring out exactly how to do that&#8211;I do remember struggling with that part&#8211;I guess that was the hardest part, I would say.</p>
<p>One other difficult thing was that I went back&#8211;when I was talking about the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Large Numbers&#8211;I went back and looked at the very specific work that was done by DeMoivre, Laplace, Gauss etc.Â  That was difficult because what they actually did is not in the form that is often attributed to them today.Â  I went back and tried to disentangle what they actually showed and tried to figure out what they were thinking, rather than just talking about the modern form of the theorem in textbooks and attributing it to them.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I see.</p>
<p>MLODINOW That took a lot of effort to figure out. I actually went back and found some of the original calculations.</p>
<p>ROBERTS In a library somewhere? In a manuscript?</p>
<p>MLODINOW They&#8217;re in academic books&#8211;there are several academic books, so I found some academic books (academic press books, I mean) that presented their actual calculations. I went through those in order to figure out and explain the differences between what they actually did and what the offshoot of their work looks like today.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>ROBERTS Did you write in high school or in college?</p>
<p>MLODINOW I started writing in third grade for my school librarian. All I remember about that was they were short stories about dinosaurs and she claimed to love them and that gave me lots of encouragement. I used to love writing little stories; I didnâ€™t do that in college very much, I do believe I did in high school. In college I was just too busy&#8211; I had three majors and also got my masterâ€™s degree, and I was only there three and a half years.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I didnâ€™t know that. Where did you go to college?</p>
<p>MLODINOW To Brandeis University.</p>
<p>ROBERTS What were your three majors and masterâ€™s degrees?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Chemistry, physics and math.</p>
<p>ROBERTS What was the masterâ€™s degree?</p>
<p>MLODINOW In physics.</p>
<p>ROBERTS In three and a half years you got a masterâ€™s degree?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes. I took about double the normal course load. I had to get special permission for that. In the end I was one course short; I had to choose between the masterâ€™s and the chemistry. I think I made the wrong choice, I chose the masterâ€™s, so I ended up with a double major but I did every chemistry course for a major except one.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Why did you do this?</p>
<p>MLODINOW I didnâ€™t do this to try and break records; I was tremendously interested in things and if I saw a course I liked I wanted to take it. I was like the clichÃ© of a kid in a candy store stuffing his face. I was stuffing my face with knowledge.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Why didnâ€™t you stay longer? Why three and a half years? Why not four and a half years?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Normal is four years and I took a semester off to live in to Israel during the Yom Kippur war, so that made it three and a half. I didnâ€™t think about staying an extra year. I went on to graduate school next so I didnâ€™t leave school. And Iâ€™m still doing that&#8211;thatâ€™s what I do by writing books is just learn things and then write about them.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, I know what you mean. Why did you choose physics rather than math or chemistry?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Chemistry was my love; chemistry and math since I was little and I had the clichÃ©d chemistry set in the basement&#8211;blew up myself, burned myself, burned down the house (well, caught the house on fire) and all sorts of things and I thought â€˜I will be a chemistâ€™ from the age of, I donâ€™t know, ten. When I got to college what happened was more and more I realized there wasnâ€™t enough math in the chemistry for me so I started out with a math and a chemistry major and I thought the math was so Mickey Mouse in chemistry that I added . . . I learned about physics while I was in Israel in the kibbutz&#8211;I talked about that experience in <em>Feynmanâ€™s Rainbow</em>&#8211;and came back and added the physics and ended up in physics. Iâ€™ve always loved math but was not excited by pure math where youâ€™re just exploring mathematics or its own sake. I always liked the applications. When I started learning about curved space it was not because the idea that Euclidian geometry isnâ€™t the only one that excited me. It was the idea that physical space might not satisfy Euclidean axioms that really excited me. That was my proclivity in that direction.</p>

					<p>ROBERTS I liked your line in <em>The Drunkard&#8217;s Walk</em> about lotteries: &#8220;What would you think of a system where one person wins a million dollars; for hundreds of thousands of people nothing happens; and one person dies a violent death.&#8221;</p>
<p>MLODINOW Would you participate?</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, would you participate? That was great.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Most people would, it turns out. But you canâ€™t quite phrase it that way.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I thought, â€˜Well, youâ€™re not going to read that line in many descriptions of lotteries.â€™ Thatâ€™s just not the way the average professor of statistics would describe a lottery. But itâ€™s so much more interesting than the average way a lottery is described. I thought, â€˜This is brilliant science writing. This person isnâ€™t just copying or popularizing.â€™</p>
<p>MLODINOW Thatâ€™s a creativity that comes into writing as well as science. Science research takes a lot of creativity and the ability to look at things from a different angle and I think writing does, too. I think one of the things that sets this book apart from other books on probability is that sort of thing; I looked at a lottery and didnâ€™t just say â€˜Here are your chances of winning and look how small they are,â€™ but I think I looked at it from a unique, somewhat amusing, surprising angle. Thatâ€™s where the work comes in writing the book, is to find those angles rather than just explaining things.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I think the average science writer would grasp that if youâ€™re going to write about the lottery, youâ€™re going to have to find some interesting stories, but I donâ€™t think theyâ€™re going to be bold enough or creative enough to think of the way that I just said&#8211;the part I quoted. Thatâ€™s kind of a writer whoâ€™s more sure of himself. You should be sure of yourself&#8211;you have all these credentials&#8211;you did all this stuff in science but I donâ€™t think the average writer is that confident. You know, Malcolm Gladwell tries to do this sort of thing. He does these slightly counter-intuitive ideas but itâ€™s less successful, I think.</p>
<p>MLODINOW An idea like that would have been hard for someone who isnâ€™t trained in the field; someone who is trained in the field I think would have confidence, if they thought of that idea, to use it. Also, thatâ€™s the two areas of confidence you need. You need confidence in the field, and you also need confidence as a writer.Â  You build the latter by writing.Â  Sometimes Iâ€™ll write sections of the book or Iâ€™ll go on for a while in a somewhat absurd&#8211;Iâ€™m thinking&#8211;direction and I know enough now to know that it sometimes works and sometimes doesnâ€™t work. I think I know enough now to tell the difference.</p>
<p>When I was first writing, I was being a bit more hesitant about getting a wild idea and going there, thinking it was going to be silly and Iâ€™m going to embarrass myself. Then I learned, well, itâ€™s good to just do that and donâ€™t worry if you waste a day or two in that direction; you can just cut it and keep going but itâ€™s a good investment because sometimes it works and you get something really interesting. I also learned with time that I can tell the difference. If it really is silly and not working, I wonâ€™t embarrass myself by leaving it in the manuscript; I will notice it and cut it and not fret over the lost day or two and Iâ€™ll go on and write something else to take its place. Those are all lessons that you have to learn but it is interesting that you brought up the notion of confidence because I think thatâ€™s something that you do learn as you write. Itâ€™s really a dual lesson of confidence&#8211;that itâ€™s okay to go ahead and take chances with the writing&#8211;and the letting go of the possible wasted time youâ€™re going to have. So the confidence to know that you wonâ€™t embarrass yourself because if itâ€™s really stupid, in the end youâ€™ll cut it and also that youâ€™re not going to fret over the wasted time are two lessons that I think you might not know your first time youâ€™re writing a book. In letting go, you have to be naked and just let yourself go and not worry about what youâ€™re saying and how it comes off.</p>
<p>ROBERTS And you know that you understand the subject. You know that thereâ€™s not going to be some other person out there whoâ€™s going to say, â€˜This is all wrong.â€™ Thatâ€™s just not going to happen.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Right. You can make mistakes in details&#8211;everybody makes misstatements sometimes. Thereâ€™s so much in a book that itâ€™s hard not to have anything come about wrong. Even Stephen Hawkingâ€™s <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, the original, gave the wrong relation at one point between wave length and energy for photons.Â  He knows the difference, but unless youâ€™re a computer you do make errors, so another lesson you have to learn is not be too embarrassed if something does come out that is a detail that you get wrong. Obviously not an important concept you get wrong.</p>

					<p>ROBERTS You learned stuff from writing TV scripts that transferred into book writing?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes, I think you do. Itâ€™s odd because thereâ€™s in many ways very little similarity.Â  Pacing, for instance, is very different on a TV show and when youâ€™re reading something but you do get a feeling for it and its importance. All those years of comedy writing certainly I think translate to having a real sense of humor, so there are certain things that do translate.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I think thereâ€™s one remarkable thing that makes your books different from other books. Your books give the impression that they want to be entertaining&#8211;the author, you, is trying to meet the reader halfway. When youâ€™re writing a TV show, itâ€™s got to be entertaining because otherwise people wonâ€™t want to watch it. Theyâ€™re not required to watch it to get a job or to get a good grade in their class; theyâ€™re watching it because they enjoy it. So youâ€™ve got to make it enjoyable. Whereas a lot of books written by professors seem to be saying, &#8220;Well, Iâ€™m so important and youâ€™re going to read my book because this is an important book to read, so Iâ€™m not going to even try to make it interesting; Iâ€™m just going to do whatever I want.&#8221; Your books are more reader-friendly in that sense.</p>
<p>MLODINOW I think thatâ€™s true. A lot of people who are very serious about their topic have a hard time seeing why you need to make it interesting or knowing how to make it interesting for people who arenâ€™t automatically interested in that topic. To me thatâ€™s one of the joys of writing. One of the satisfactions is when I go, â€˜Wow, I made that really funnyâ€™ or â€˜I made that really interesting,â€™ and then I get excited by that.</p>
<p>ROBERTS That talent&#8211;it really helped you to have written for TV because itâ€™s kind of a fresh voice.</p>
<p>MLODINOW I think it helped to develop my voice, too, especially the comedy part, you know? And what my credits show is obviously a small part of what I write. For example at one point I was thinking that maybe I wanted to get on Leno or one of those late night comedy shows and we never really went that far with it, but I did spend some days writing stand up lines and pure joke writing to try to get some material together for my agent to show around.Â  Probably very few other science writers have gone through an exercise such as that. That all, I think, contributes to being able to write with a sense of humor. Of course, you have to have a personality that gravitates in that direction in the first place.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>ROBERTS I like to think that because you cover so many hundreds of years when you discuss geometry or probability that&#8211;and thereâ€™s so many interesting characters and they have to be so brilliant to make a lasting contribution to those fields&#8211;that youâ€™re able to draw from a richer material than most writers. You have to be a very unusual person to make a lasting contribution to probability theory. [That came out wrong. You have to be a very unusual person to make a lasting contribution to any field.]</p>
<p>MLODINOW Right, well certainly mathematicians tend to be very unusual and colorful, odd sorts. That helps when youâ€™re writing a book about them. The physicist are maybe not quite as odd. My book <em>Feynmanâ€™s Rainbow</em> was really about just one physicist and he was very colorful, so I got away with that. The work I do with Stephen Hawking is different in that sense&#8211;thereâ€™s not that much history in those books. In our new book that weâ€™re doing, he doesnâ€™t want us to much history at all, so weâ€™re going to focus on the concepts.</p>
<p>ROBERTS . . . Letâ€™s start with your writing career. You seem to have been a good writer by the time you got your PhD because as I understand it, you were able to actually get a writing job after leaving Cal Tech. You must have been at a very high level by that time; you wrote a spec script for, what, Star Trek? Or some other show?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Well, my rise in Hollywood is a long and involved story, but yes, I did rise pretty quickly. After Cal Tech I went to the Max Planck Institute in Munich and then I came to Hollywood to make my way and in six months I was working at my first TV job, which was a really crappy show on cable, which was pretty new then&#8211;cable, I mean. And from there I worked by way up to network shows&#8211;I did comedies such as Night Court, the original Gary Shandling show and I wrote for dramas as well including MacGuyver and as you said, Star Trek: The Next Generation. That was a crazy period of life.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I got the impression that you already knew how to write really well by then.</p>
<p>MLODINOW I think that in a way . . . I guess thereâ€™s two components to being able to write. One is your natural proclivity, I try not to say talent, but itâ€™s your voice or the way you express yourself. And the other is the craft part of it that you learn by doing. I think I always had a good sense of humor and maybe a way to say things colorfully or think in terms of dramatic or powerful situations and I guess thatâ€™s the first part and served well. The other part is the things you learn as you go, such as what puts people to sleep or how to abandon what you think are good ideas but really arenâ€™t. Thatâ€™s a hard lesson to learn because itâ€™s difficult to let go of things you might like and to realize that it just doesnâ€™t belong or goes on too far or the idea that sometimes itâ€™s hard to recognize things that may be good but just donâ€™t belong there&#8211;that are tangents and they take away the dramatic thrust of where youâ€™re going and they really have to be cut even though theyâ€™re good and you like them. You know, lessons like that, lessons about pacing&#8211;you learn by doing, by failing. You learn more about pacing, all sorts of technical aspects of writing, whether its fiction or nonfiction or TV or books; there are certain principles that you just learn by repeatedly doing and doing wrong and realizing, absorbing what went wrong and fixing it and you grow that way. In book writing youâ€™re able to do that a lot with rough drafts so a lot of your mistakes donâ€™t end up getting published&#8211;you know? TV writing can be so fast that often you donâ€™t see the problems with the script until you actually watch it on the air and then you go, â€˜Next time I think I wonâ€™t have that guy climbing the stairs for four minutes in the middle of the scene; I think five seconds is enough to get the idea across.â€™</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I was 15 or so when I first read a John Updike novel. To my amazement, it was <em>fun to read</em>. The novels I&#8217;d read in English class, such as <em>Oliver Twist</em>, had never been fun to read. I read a lot more Updike and figured out he liked Nabokov. So I picked up <em>Pnin</em>. I loved Nabokov, it turned out. You could say Updike was an easy-listening version of Nabokov. He was the first person who taught me to enjoy literature. He was the bridge.</p>
<p>For a long time I read almost everything he wrote (except <em>The Poorhouse Fair</em>) but around <em>S.</em> I stopped. Maybe because I was watching more TV. I continued to read all his stuff in <em>The New Yorker</em>, but maybe it is fitting that, in his entire career, the thing he said that I like best occurred on TV. In a <a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_jupdike_dcal.html">National Book Award acceptance speech</a> (1998) he said, &#8220;A book is beautiful in its relation to the human hand, to the human eye, to the human brain, and to the human spirit.&#8221;</p>

					<p>ROBERTS What other nonfiction writers do you like to read?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Thatâ€™s a good question. Strangely Iâ€™ve never thought about that.Â  I can name novelists I repeatedly read, but most nonfiction writers that I like write to subjects of their own expertise, and I pick up nonfiction books based on what they are about more than on who wrote them.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Such as what? Which books?</p>
<p>MLODINOW For instance, Carl Sagan if you want to go back a little bit. I enjoyed several of his books; they tended to be, obviously, on astronomy or issues related. I also enjoyed <em>Freakonomics</em>, and I like Oliver Sacks&#8217;s books on neuroscience.Â  And Daniel Gilbertâ€™s book <em>Stumbling on Happiness</em>; I donâ€™t know if Gilbert will turn around now and write a book on geometry . . .</p>
<p>ROBERTS I donâ€™t think so.</p>
<p>MLODINOW . . . these authors write about their own field.Â  Oh, I do enjoy Simon Winchesterâ€™s books and he tends to branch out. I think heâ€™s a good writer.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Was he a professor? He might have been a PhD in geology.</p>
<p>MLODINOW I donâ€™t know.Â  But I do believe he had a number of unsuccessful books before&#8211;I forget which was his first successful book . . .</p>
<p>ROBERTS <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, I think.</p>
<p>MLODINOW <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, right.Â  His wife, I think, pushed him to write that.Â  If I remember the story correctly, he wasnâ€™t initially going to write it. I think I am unusual in that Iâ€™m a science writer who writes in a variety of topics.Â  I am finishing a new book with Stephen Hawking right now, called <em>The Grand Design</em>, on the origin of the universe, and of the apparent laws of nature.Â  Then my next book is going to be on the unconscious mind.</p>
<p>ROBERTS A friend just asked me about a book on consciousness. She said, â€˜Well, what about this book by _____?â€™ (I donâ€™t want to say his name), and I said â€˜No, I donâ€™t like that.â€™ And she said, â€˜Well, what would you recommend?â€™ And I said, â€˜I donâ€™t think there are any good books on consciousness except the one my friend is writing.â€™</p>
<p>MLODINOW Well thank you; I hope to live up to that. Iâ€™ve found that there is a niche available in that field. There have been a lot of books but a lot of them have been case studies or peopleâ€™s individual pet theories about what consciousness is and I think that for someone like me from the outside, who yet has a scientific understanding, there is room for a good book there. And there probably is room every five or ten years for another one because it is a very fast moving field.</p>

					<p><em><img src="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~len/images/Mlodinow.jpg" />Leonard Mlodinow&#8217;s most recent book is </em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview4">The Drunkard&#8217;s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives</a><em>, which was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. The first book of his that I read was </em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T10xBHjyuXIC&#038;dq=Leonard+Mlodinow&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;source=an&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;resnum=4&#038;ct=result#PPA1,M1">Feynman&#8217;s Rainbow</a><em>. It was so good I wrote him a fan letter. He came to talk at Berkeley in connection with </em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LvUoAAAACAAJ&#038;dq=Leonard+Mlodinow&#038;source=an&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;resnum=5&#038;ct=result">A Briefer History of Time</a><em> (which he co-wrote with Stephen Hawking). After his talk I told him how much I had liked </em><em>Feynman&#8217;s Rainbow. Because I was a psychology professor he asked my opinion of the parts of </em>The Drunkard&#8217;s Walk<em> that involved psychology. That&#8217;s how we met. </em></p>
<p>ROBERTSÂ  Youâ€™re a scientist but you also are a good writer and you appreciate the science&#8211;no oneâ€™s telling you, &#8220;this is good and this is bad,&#8221; you can figure it out for yourself. Is that fair? Is that accurate?</p>
<p>MLODINOW I hope so. As a scientist I like to think I have good taste in judging what is good science, at least. Itâ€™s not always so easy to judge which directions are the ones that are going to be fruitful, obviously, but certainly in judging whatâ€™s good science, or more importantly I think, in judging what science is crucial for the public to understand and how to make it exciting for them. Thatâ€™s one thing that I think a lot of scientists donâ€™t know how to do, which is how to look at from the point of view of a person who isnâ€™t a scientist and explain it in an interesting and amusing, entertaining and most of all exciting way. One of my pet peeves is that, among the general public, people think that science is dry and boring and done by nerds who wear accountant-type thick glasses and white coats.Â  Really itâ€™s done by people who experience huge ups and downs and have as much passion for their subject as other professions that are considered more romantic, like artists.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Unlike other people who write about science, I think youâ€™re writing intellectual history. I mean, youâ€™re not saying, &#8220;Oh, this is a popular topic; this came up in the last ten years as a new popular topic Iâ€™m going to write a book about.&#8221; Youâ€™re writing about things like geometry and probability, which are ancient topics. Thatâ€™s really unusual. Am I right?</p>
<p>MLODINOW When I write about something, itâ€™s because that excites me and I see a relevance to our world today. When I wrote <em>Euclidâ€™s Window</em> about geometry, it was really about the idea of curved space and curved space is so important in modern physics and even in technology. If you look at, say, global positioning systems, you have to use Einsteinâ€™s Theory of Gravitation which is based on curved space and I thought that no one really sat down before and explained, taking their time, what is curved space and what is un-curved space and how do we get that idea and where did it come from and looking at fascinating stories, so thatâ€™s where Euclidâ€™s Window came from. In <em>The Drunkardâ€™s Walk</em> it was similar in the sense that there had been other books about probability or other books about statistics and other books about randomness, but I donâ€™t think there had been any book on all three of them, but what propelled me was the idea that not just to write about these concepts but the realization that theyâ€™re very important in everyday life, and really the focus on everyday life and how these concepts can help us see it differently.</p>
<p>ROBERTS And itâ€™s better written than the other books, I have to say.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Thank you.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Thatâ€™s really important, I mean, what good is it to write a book if itâ€™s hard to read?</p>
<p>MLODINOW I think thatâ€™s what I bring to this field, is both knowing the science and being able to write well, and with a sense of humor.Â  There are plenty of people who know the science and plenty of people out there who write well, but there are few who can do both.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m enjoying <a href="http://www.lastdaysofoldbeijing.com/TheLastDaysOfOldBeijing/Book.html"><em>The Last Days of Old Beijing: Life in the Vanishing Backstreets of a City Transformed</em></a> by Michael Meyer, one of a few fun books I brought to China. (The others are <a href="http://www.howwedrive.com/"><em>Traffic</em></a> by Tom Vanderbilt and <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=1024"><em>The Corpse Walker</em></a> by Liao Yiwu.) It&#8217;s about living in a downtown <em>hutong</em>. What pleases me most is how good his Chinese must be (I want reassurance I can learn it) but I also like strange stuff like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Watching TV in a friend's apartment, Spring Festival 2006.] The annual variety show paused from its singing and acrobatic performances to announce that China would send a pair of pandas to Taiwan as a measure of friendship. The program&#8217;s five hundred million viewers could pick the animals&#8217; names by choosing from a list and sending a text message via cell phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says we can&#8217;t vote?&#8221; [his friend] laughed. . .</p>
<p>We ate and watched television until Unity and Wholeness were announced as winners of the name-the-panda election. (Taiwan&#8217;s government would initially refuse the animals.)</p></blockquote>
<p>What were the other candidate names, I wonder.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Failure: the last taboo subject. I loved <em><a href="http://www.archipelago.org/vol5-3/cheever.htm">Selling Ben Cheever</a>, </em>a book about a series of low-level service jobs that Ben Cheever took after he left <em>Reader&#8217;s Digest</em> and couldn&#8217;t sell his third novel. In the introduction, Cheever noted that no one wanted to talk to him about what it was like to lose a job and have to start over. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/excerpts/2007-09-17-starbucks-saved-my-life_N.htm"><em>How Starbucks Saved My Life</em></a> by Michael Gates Gill is another excellent book along those lines. (Curious that both authors are the sons of well-iknown writers, John Cheever and Brendan Gill.)</p>
<p>Now comes a scientific third-person account of failure: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/books/review/Finkbeiner-t.html?8bu&#038;emc=bu"><em>Sun in a Bottle</em> by Charles Seife</a>, about attempts to produce nuclear fusion in the lab.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seifeâ€™s message: fusion scientists should just cut bait. By analogy to your closet, if you havenâ€™t worn it, throw it out. If youâ€™ve been trying it for the last half-century and it hasnâ€™t worked, then enough already.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to its subtitle, the book covers &#8220;the science of wishful thinking.&#8221; Was it wishful thinking or avoidance of the f-word? I will have to read the book to find out, it sounds fascinating.</p>
