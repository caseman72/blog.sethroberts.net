				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A month ago I bought three identical tea pots <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/">to compare tea</a> side by side. I hoped to take advantage of<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/08/the-willat-effect-side-by-side-comparisons-create-connoisseurs/"> the Willat Effect</a> (side-by-side comparisons create connoisseurs) to become a tea connoisseur.</p>
<p>It worked. Side-by-side tea comparisons are fun, easy, and have taught me a lot. When I drink tea I notice more and like it more. I do about three comparisons per day. I blogged about the first results <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/24/even-more-about-the-willat-effect/">here</a>. The most useful idea about these comparisons came from Carl Willat himself: Compare the same tea brewed differently (e.g., different amounts of tea, different brewing times, different water temperatures). Most of my comparisons vary amount of tea or brewing time.</p>
<p>These many  comparisons have had several effects:<span id="more-4480"></span></p>
<p>1. Yeah, I&#8217;m a snob. No more cheap tea. Yeah, I&#8217;m more nerdy about it.</p>
<p>2. I bought a scale (<a href="http://www.camry.cn/products/Pocket-Scales-EHA901.htm">Camry EHA901</a>, $12 in America) with a precision of 0.01 gram. No more heaping teaspoons. Mostly I use 1.5 grams of tea with about 170 ml water. For dense tea, 1.5 grams is roughly 1 teaspoon. Standard-size teabags contain about 2 g of tea.</p>
<p>3. Much different brewing times than recommended. The black tea I have now is Ahmad Tea English Tea No. 1 (in spite of the name, not expensive). The tin says &#8220;infuse 4-6 minutes.&#8221; I used to brew it (and all black tea) 5 minutes, now I prefer less than 3 minutes. I found that 2.75 minutes is better than 3 minutes.  Around 3 minutes it starts getting bitter &#8212; I never noticed! Another example is  <a href="http://www.americantearoom.com/">American Tea Room</a>&#8216;s Choco Late, which contains cacao husks, vanilla, and rooibos. The package says brew 5 minutes. I prefer 30 minutes &#8212; 30 minutes tastes better than 20 minutes, I have found several times.</p>
<p>4. To make the comparisons as sensitive as possible I want to start with equal tea pots, so I need to clean them well after each use. This became boring. I could eliminate cleaning by using tea bags. I bought ordinary-size empty tea bags. Side-by-side comparisons (same tea, bagged versus loose) showed they made the flavor much worse. Too bad I&#8217;d bought 200. I bought much larger tea bags to use as liners rather than bags. That worked fine &#8212; no cleaning needed, taste just as good. However, they are too large, so I shorten them. The concept of a disposable tea liner (instead of tea bag) <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;tea+liner&quot;">seems to be new</a>. I cannot <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22disposable%20tea%20liner%22">find any for sale</a>. My connoisseurship has not only caused me to spend much more on tea, it has made me want an interesting new product. Tea pot makers could sell liners specially designed for their pots.  Continuing revenue, like razor blades.</p>
<p>5. I stopped adding artificial sweetener (e.g.,  Splenda) to black tea. Now I prefer it without sweetener.  I continue to add cream to black tea. This is the most surprising and intriguing change. Maybe sweetness is a distraction from the complexity of the flavor (which I now notice more and derive more pleasure from), but creaminess is not. I imagine the same thing is behind <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/10/please-do-not-buy-richard-stallman-a-parrot-and-other-rules/">Richard Stallman&#8217;s</a> &#8220;If it <em></em>is tea I really like, I like it without milk and sugar.&#8221; And maybe the same thing is behind all sorts of artistic expression that strike outsiders as harsh and unpleasant. A few years ago I went to a <a href="http://www.bam.org/">BAM</a> (Brooklyn Academy of Music) concert and was stunned how unpleasant it was. Yet the composer (who performed it) surely enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Regular readers know I think <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf">connoisseurship evolved because it increased technological innovation</a>. My experience so far supports this. Thanks to the Willat Effect, I am more of a connoisseur. As a result of this change, I am spending more on high-end artisanal goods (expensive tea) and precision manufacturing (precision scale)  and I want a new product (disposable tea liners).</p>
<p>People think of connoisseurs as having higher standards. The word <em>connoisseur</em> seems to mean exactly that.  Iin some obvious ways, they do. Yet the sweetener change (I no longer want sweetener) is in a way a <strong>lowering</strong> of standards. Sweetness is pleasant. I no longer require, or even want, my tea to be sweet. As far as I can tell, something like this is true throughout the arts. Connoisseurs make unusual demands, yes, but in some ways they are easier to please than non-connoisseurs. Indie films are less pleasant than mainstream films. Yet film connoisseurs like them more. To most people, indie films are also much cheaper and more experimental than mainstream films. By supporting them &#8212; by preferring them &#8212; film connoisseurs are supporting innovation. The connoisseurs have lowered their standards for film in the sense that they can enjoy cheaper films. A friend of mine attends the San Francisco International Film Festival  each year. He enjoys it. I wouldn&#8217;t. The SF film festival films don&#8217;t cost much, yet  they have a certain innovative quality. (I&#8221;m not a film connoisseur, I barely understand it.) The source of pleasure has shifted from conventional sources (plot, music, dialogue, gorgeous actors, sets, and landscapes) to something else, perhaps novelty and complexity.</p>

It happens in seconds: Suddenly the differences matter more. Some versions become more pleasant, other versions less pleasant.  I first noticed it with limoncello that my friend Carl Willat offered me. Here are some reactions to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/">my recent post about it</a>: <span id="more-4254"></span></p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/n/?benfischler%2Fposts%2F261755930527999&amp;mid=507e1ddG209d0c13G867c26aG5b&amp;bcode=VkghKG9i&amp;n_m=carl%40carlsfinefilms.com">A Facebook comment</a> from a friend of Carl&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>I too can confirm the existence of The Willat Effect. Example: I&#8217;ll look at a coat that feels and looks great, see the price and say I can&#8217;t afford this. Then I&#8217;ll try another on and it&#8217;s close to the first but not quite but it&#8217;s also 300 dollars less. I opt for the first, spending more. Carl&#8217;s taught me to never settle for second best. And he doesn&#8217;t make a bad limoncello either.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes to both. I recently went bike shopping in Beijing. I asked a Chinese friend who makes the best bikes: Giant, she said. A Taiwanese company. I found a Giant store. I chose the model I wanted. I test-drove it. Fine, except the seat was too short. This could not be fixed, they said. I didn&#8217;t like any other Giant model. I would have to buy a different make of bike. There were other bike stores nearby, all with cheaper bikes. (Giant bikes cost about 40% more than the next most costly.) I tested a few. The cheaper bikes were clearly worse than the Giant bike: less smooth ride. Too bad for me. I chose one to buy. The problem of too-short seat remained, but the seller said he could fix it. He brought out a longer neck that could be attached to a seat. I bought the longer neck, took it to the Giant store, and got my first-choice bike. I am especially pleased how smoothly it rides. In the Giant store (franchise), there was no bargaining &#8212; the sticker price was the actual price &#8212; and the employees were standoffish. In the other stores (non-franchise), you could bargain and the employees were friendly. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/benjamin_wallace_on_the_price_of_happiness.html">This talk</a> mentions the very smooth ride of a very expensive car.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/18/the-willat-effect-hedonic-change-caused-by-side-by-side-comparison-of-similar-things.html">A Boing Boing post about this</a> linked to <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/18/iphone-4s-vs-canon-5d-mkii-video-comparison-side-by-side.html#disqus_thread">a side-by-side comparison of expensive cameras</a> &#8212; that is, a side-by-side comparison of the pictures they take. As <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/#comment-928600">David Scrimshaw commented</a>, this sh** is dangerous. It could make me dissatisfied with what was previously (and in other ways still is) perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>3. I compared black tea steeped for 3 minutes with the same tea steeped for 5 minutes. I tasted them side by side. I have been drinking black tea for 10 years. For the first time I noticed that the 5-minute tea had a strong bitter note unnoticeable in the 3-minute tea. People had told me that if you steep black tea too long it becomes bitter. I thought they meant if you steep it for 8 minutes it becomes bitter. I routinely steeped black tea 5 minutes. I told someone about this and he said <em>rinse the tea first</em>. This made no sense (experienced tea drinkers rinse certain green teas, not black teas) but I tried it. I found that ten seconds of rinsing (add water, wait 10 seconds, discard water) didn&#8217;t eliminate the bitterness. There was no clear difference between rinsed and unrinsed tea.</p>
<p>4. I agree with commenters who said I should taste my tea &#8220;blind&#8221; &#8212; not knowing the price. That&#8217;s a good idea. During a tea-tasting tour of Beijing (which did not include side-by-side comparisons of similar teas and had little effect on my green tea consumption), I learned that at the wholesale level green tea leaves are priced lot by lot. The buyer tastes tea made from the tea leaves for sale and offers a price. If I notice a correlation for green tea between cost and how much I like it, it presumably reflects this earlier process.  As far as I can tell in Beijing there is no advertising for different varieties of green tea. Tea stores usually sell it in bulk in identical bins. No packaging, no boasts or claims.</p>
<p>5. Does the effect happen <strong>because</strong> I knew the teas cost different prices? I doubt it. During the first example, with limoncello, I had no idea of the prices. The homemade limoncellos, which were not identified, had no price. I have noticed the effect <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/09/my-theory-of-human-evolution-american-idol-edition/">with YouTube videos</a> (different covers of one song), which are free. I have done side-by-side tastings of cheeses, wines, etc., that varied greatly in price countless times. No Willat Effect, presumably because they weren&#8217;t similar enough (e.g., the two wines came from different lines of grapes). But I agree it would be nice to eliminate the effect of price differences.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/#comment-928788">Wangston commented</a>: &#8220;More expensive things taste better because rarity is delicious.&#8221;  There is certainly pressure to say expensive things taste better. You/we are supposed to think that. Millions of advertisers would like us to think that. Surely the phrase <em>the finer things in life</em> came from an ad. Maybe ads are where the pressure comes from. In my experience, without side-by-side comparisons more expensive things usually do not taste better.  For example, I have never done side-by-side comparisons of wine. And  expensive wines ($30/bottle) taste no better than much cheaper wines ($10/bottle). Before I did side-by-side cheese tastings, $30/pound cheese tasted no better than $10/pound cheese. After side-by-side cheese tastings, only then did I notice and care about the difference. I started to pay much more for cheese. I wish I could make the cheap stuff taste better but every time (tea, cheese, orange marmalade, sake) the expensive stuff turns out to be what tastes better. Contradicting the &#8220;rational actor&#8221; assumption of economists.</p>
<p>7. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/#comment-928626">Robin Barooah commented</a> that with experience you form a mental map of the product space. He is &#8220;something of a coffee connoisseur&#8221; and has a mental map of the coffee space. This has allowed him to enjoy less-than-the-best coffees because they have their place and he enjoys brewing them in different ways.  My limited experience entirely supports this. I have never gone far with these close comparisons. I am not a connoisseur of anything. But from my mere two weeks of close tea comparisons I feel the beginnings of a mental map. I hope, as Robin says, it will allow me to enjoy tea I can afford. In Beijing, the most expensive tea is insanely expensive &#8212; like $1000/pound.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/08/the-willat-effect-side-by-side-comparisons-create-connoisseurs/">The Willat Effect</a> is the hedonic change caused by side-by-side comparison of similar things. Your hedonic response to the things compared (e.g., two or more dark chocolates) expands in both directions. The &#8220;better&#8221; things become more pleasant and the &#8220;worse&#8221; things become less pleasant. In my experience, it&#8217;s a big change, easy to notice.</p>
<p>I discovered the Willat Effect when my friend Carl Willat offered me five different limoncellos side by side. Knowing that he likes it, his friends had given them to him. Perhaps three were homemade, two store-bought. I&#8217;d had plenty of limoncello before that, but always one version at a time. Within seconds of tasting the five versions side by side, I came to like two of them (with more complex flavors) more than the rest. One or two of them I started to dislike. When you put two similar things next to each other, of course you see their differences more clearly. What&#8217;s impressive is the hedonic change.</p>
<p>The Willat Effect supports <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf">my ideas about human evolution</a> because it pushes people toward connoisseurship. (I predict it won&#8217;t occur with animals.) The fact that repeating elements are found in so many decorating schemes and patterns meant to be pretty (e.g., wallpapers, textile patterns, rugs, choreography) suggests that we get pleasure from putting similar things side by side &#8212; the very state that produces the Willat Effect. According to my theory of human evolution, connoisseurship evolved because it created demand for hard-to-make goods, which helped the most skilled artisans make a living. Carl&#8217;s limoncello tasting made me a mini-connoisseur of limoncello. I started buying it much more often and  bought more expensive brands, thus helping the best limoncello makers make a living. Connoisseurs turn surplus into innovation by giving the most skilled artisans more time and freedom to innovate.</p>
<p>Does the Willat Effect have practical value? Could it improve my life? Recently I decided to see if it could make me a green tea connoisseur. Ever since I discovered the Shangri-La Diet (calories without smell), I&#8217;d been drinking tea (smell without calories) almost daily but I was no connoisseur. Nor had I done many side-by-side comparisons. At home, I had always made one cup at a time.</p>
<p>In Beijing, where I am now, I can easily buy many green teas. I got three identical tea pots (SAMA SAG-08) and three cheap green teas. I drink tea every morning. Instead of brewing one pot, I started making two or three pots at the same time and comparing the results. I compared different teas and the same tea brewed different lengths of time (Carl&#8217;s idea).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this about two weeks. The results so far:</p>
<p>1. The cheapest tea became undrinkable. I decided to never buy it again and not to drink the  rest of my purchase. I will use it for kombucha. Two of the three teas cost about twice the cheapest one. After a few side by side comparisons I liked the more expensive ones considerably more than the cheaper one. The two more expensive ones cost about the same but, weirdly, I liked the one that cost (slightly) more a little better than the one that cost less. (Tea is sold in bulk with no packaging or branding so the price I pay is closely related to what the grower was paid. The buyers taste it and decide what it&#8217;s worth.)</p>
<p>2. I decided to infuse the tea leaves only once. (Usual practice is to infuse green tea two or more times.)  The quality of later infusions was too low, I decided. Before this, I had found second and later infusions had been acceptable.</p>
<p>The Willat Effect is working, in other words. After a decade of drinking tea, my practices suddenly changed.  I will buy different teas and brew them differently. I will spend a lot more per cup since (a) each cup will require fresh tea, (b) I won&#8217;t buy the cheapest tea, and (c) I have become far more interested in green tea, partly because each cup tastes better, partly because I am curious if more expensive varieties taste better. When I bought the three varieties I have now I didn&#8217;t bother to learn their names; I identified them by price. In the future I will learn the names.</p>
<p>To get the Willat Effect, the things being compared must be quite similar. For example, comparing green tea with black tea does nothing. I have learned a methodological lesson: That tea is a great medium for studying this not only because it&#8217;s cheap but also because you can easily get similar tasting teas by brewing the same tea different lengths of time. I haven&#8217;t yet tried different water temperatures but that too might work.</p>
<p>I have done similar things before. I bought several versions of orange marmalade, did side-by-side tastings, and indeed became an orange marmalade connoisseur. After that I bought only expensive versions. After a few side-by-side comparisons of cheese that included expensive cheeses, I stopped buying cheap cheese. You could say I am still an orange marmalade and cheese connoisseur but this has no effect on my current life. Because I avoid sugar, I don&#8217;t eat orange marmalade. Because of all the butter I eat, I rarely eat cheese. My budding green tea connoisseurship, however, <strong>is</strong> making a  difference because I drink tea every day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About ten years ago, while visiting my friend Carl Willat, he presented me with five versions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limoncello">limoncello</a> (an Italian lemon liqueur) side by side in shot glasses. Two were store-bought, the rest homemade, if I remember correctly. I tried them one by one. I had had limoncello many times but never different versions side by side. It was easy to notice differences between them. Obviously. What surprised me was an hedonic reaction: I thought two of them (with more complex flavors) were wonderful and one (store-bought) was awful. Both reactions (wonderful and awful) were stronger than usual. In a small way, I&#8217;d become a connoisseur. After that, I was happy to buy expensive limoncello (e.g., $26). I no longer bought cheap limoncello ($18). I call the hedonic changes produced by side-by-side comparisons <em>the Willat Effect</em>. Carl became a connoisseur of Italian hand-painted tableware due to side by side comparisons. I believe <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">connoisseurs were important in human evolution because they helped support skilled artisans</a>. Our design preference for repeated elements (e.g., wallpaper, textiles) evolved so that we would put similar things side by side.<span id="more-3262"></span></p>
<p>I mentioned  a downside of the Willat Effect <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/03/unofficial-beer-tasting-winner-uncommon-brewers/">a few posts ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Five or six years ago I went to a sake-tasting event in San Francisco called &#8220;The Joy of Sake&#8221;. About 140 sakes. In a few hours I became such a sake connoisseur that the sake I could afford  &#8212; and used to buy regularly &#8212; I now despised. The only sake I now liked was so expensive ($80/bottle) that I never bought another bottle of sake.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.pursuitoftruthiness.wordpress.com/">A reader named James Bailey</a> commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>And you still go to tastings?? It seems like ignorance is bliss here, better to preserve your ability to enjoy cheap things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I still go to tastings. The sake tasting was the only one that had that effect. Mostly they have no effect because the samples vary too much. For example, I&#8217;ve been to many wine tastings but haven&#8217;t become much of a wine connoisseur. The many wines at the tastings were all over the place. If I want to get the effect, I usually have to do it myself: buy several versions of a product and try them side by side. I recently did this for whiskey. When I go back to Beijing maybe I&#8217;ll do it for some sort of tea.</p>
<p>When I do it myself I control the price range and limit the high end to what I can afford. I didn&#8217;t buy $80 whiskeys, for example, although many were available. So the effect makes me enjoy stuff at the upper end of what I&#8217;ll pay. When I became an assistant professor, I thought it would be fun to enjoy fine art (e.g., paintings) more. I attended several art history classes. They had no effect &#8212; I was bored. Side-by-side comparisons, in contrast, actually work and, as Carl illustrated, are easily shared. And they are consumerist and artisanal at the same time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will Amy Winehouse &#8212; who won five Grammys last night &#8212; help or hurt the music industry? A few years ago, I went to a tasting event called The Joy of Sake. There were about 100 of the best sakes from Japan. A pre-event talk for retailers discussed the decline of sake in Japan. (Soju is cool; sake is old-fashioned.) That was the reason for the show. I loved tasting 30-odd high-quality sakes but the overall effect on me was the opposite of what the promoters wanted. I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/09/my-theory-of-human-evolution-american-idol-edition/">quickly became a connoisseur</a>. I no longer liked the cheap stuff &#8212; ugh! But the stuff I <em>did</em> like was too expensive. I stopped buying sake. </p>
<p>Before last night I had heard of Amy Winehouse and I had heard Rehab, but hadn&#8217;t put the two together. Her Grammy performance blew me away. I watched a bunch of YouTubes of her. Back at the Grammys, I listened to an orchestra play Rhapsody in Blue. I used to like it; now it sounded awful. I listened to a few more group performances; they too sounded bad. Just as The Joy of Sake had made me no longer enjoy cheap sake, listening to a lot of Amy Winehouse had made me no longer enjoy &#8220;average&#8221; music &#8212; music where several individual performances are combined.</p>
<p>I thought of <em>The Black Swan</em> by Nassim Taleb. Taleb defined <em>Mediocristan</em> as situations where no one datum can have a big effect on the result. The average height of 100 people, for example. In <em>Extremistan</em>, by contrast, a single datum <em>can</em> make a big difference. The average wealth of 100 people, for example &#8212; one person can have much more money than the other 99 put together. Orchestras are Mediocristan, I realized; individual singers are Extremistan. In art, emotional impact is everything. Extremistan allows really big impact; Mediocristan does not. Maybe this is why classical music is dying.</p>
<p>I felt like throwing away half my CDs. I could use the space. Thanks, Amy!</p>
