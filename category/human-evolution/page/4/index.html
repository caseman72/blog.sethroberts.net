					<p>In a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1877191-3,00.html"><em>Time </em>article</a> about the future of journalism &#8212; the problem of course is that it is free online &#8212; Walter Isaacson writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Others smarter than we were had avoided that trap. For example, when Bill Gates noticed in 1976 that hobbyists were freely sharing Altair BASIC, a code he and his colleagues had written, he sent an open letter to members of the Homebrew Computer Club telling them to stop. &#8220;One thing you do is prevent good software from being written,&#8221; he railed. <strong>&#8220;Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?&#8221; </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Many people do professional work for nothing: the creators of open-source software, for one. Not to mention bloggers who write about their professional expertise (such as me) or my friend <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/02/02/if-commercials-told-emotional-truth/">Carl Willat</a> (who made a commercial for nothing). Many book writers do professional work (in the sense that what they write is based on their profession) for next to nothing.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">my theory of human evolution</a> before occupational specialization came hobbies &#8212; skilled work done for nothing. The mental tendencies that led us to do hobbies are still within us</p>

<p>Andrew Gelman <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/08/the-statistics.html">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/arts/design/04pica.html">article</a> [about economics professor David Galenson] then quotes art professor Michael Rushton as saying that in science or art, &#8220;innovation really requires a market.&#8221; Huh? Wha?? Tell that to my friend Seth, who spent 10 years self-experimentation. Heck, tell that to the cave painters. Or check out the American Visionary Art Museum.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. I was able to do self-experimentation for 10 years <em>because </em>I didn&#8217;t have to sell, i.e., publish it. Not having to sell &#8212; I mean publish &#8212; it gave me the freedom to do and think whatever I wanted for as long as I wanted.</p>
<p>Innovation benefits not from markets but from subsidies, which provide time to experiment. In my case, I was a professor at Berkeley &#8212; subsidized by the State of California. I had tenure and free time. Sometimes the subsidies aren&#8217;t obvious. Part of <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/27/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">my theory of human evolution</a> is that gifts, ceremonies, holidays, fashion, and connoisseurs, not to mention love of art, subsidized artists and artisans by providing a desire for work that &#8212; in the absence of gifts, etc. &#8212; would be much harder to make a living from. Helping artists and artisans make a living helped them advance their technology. Cave paintings may have been part of a holiday observance &#8212; the artists took time off from hunting. Before trade, Thorstein Veblen&#8217;s Instinct of Workmanship motivated innovation. Andrew himself built the table in the above photo for reasons that had nothing to do with markets.</p>
<p>But at least an economics professor is studying innovation. A few years ago in the Berkeley Public Library I picked up an introductory economics textbook. Six or seven hundred pages. Half a page on innovation!</p>

<p>The father of one of my Chinese tutors used to work at a coal mine (in an administrative position) but after his wife went away to care for her sick mother he wanted a job without night shifts to better care for his two children. He decided to make a business of fixing bicycle tire pumps. People who fixed bicycles were common but hardly anyone fixed the pumps.</p>
<p>Was it hard to start such a business? No. There was a tradition in his small town of persons walking through neighborhoods announcing what they had to sell. Like ice cream trucks. Coal, fruit, baked goods, and other things were/are sold that way. (He preferred to buy his coal directly from the mine.) At first, he used his unaided voice, later he got an electric megaphone, now he has a recording.</p>
<p>I believe human language began like this. Language began and grew because itÂ  facilitated trade. Facilitating trade facilitated occupational specialization, the essential difference between humans and other animals. Words &#8212; single words, repeated many times &#8212; were the first advertising, the original Craig&#8217;s List.Â  Again and again, you said the word of what you wanted or what you had to offer.</p>

					<p>In 1952, following the Soviet model, Tsinghua University was stripped of its humanities and social science departments and became an MIT-like university entirely devoted to engineering and science. Eventually it became clear this was a mistake. Fifteen years ago a School of Humanities and Social Sciences was established to begin to restore things. Two weeks ago, because I am a faculty member in that School, I got a fancy tea set to mark the 15th anniversary of its founding. Here is what the tea set looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3289/3036796549_fe08d5356f.jpg?v=0" /></p>
<p>I asked a Chinese friend of mine to explain it to me. She pointed to the tools in the box with the cups. &#8220;They&#8217;re useless,&#8221; she said. She pointed to the slatted bamboo box. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s useless,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>To pour the tea you put the cups on the slats. The box is slatted so that if you spill some tea while pouring the surface will continue to look good. It&#8217;s not the total uselessness my friend saw but she is right that the added value of the slats and the tools, in practical terms, is very low.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/27/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">My theory of human evolution</a> says that the reason for gifts, ceremonies, and special days (such as Christmas) is to provide a demand for hard-to-make stuff. This allows artisans on the cutting edge to make a living and further develop their skills, advancing the start of the art. This is why gifts and ceremonial things are typically hard to make and, were it not for their value as gifts, not worth making. My friend&#8217;s reaction illustrates this. My theory predicts that this feature of gifts, ceremonies, and special days has a genetic basis and should be found in all cultures. This example shows it is found in a culture quite different from American culture.</p>

					<p>The City of Berkeley, which Jane Jacobs called a &#8220;pretentious suburb,&#8221; isn&#8217;t doing well economically. There was a Barnes &#038; Noble downtown, a kind of anchor store. It closed. There was a Ross downtown. It closed. Chain stores don&#8217;t do well in Berkeley. One downtown corner has gone through several renters, including Gateway Computers, Cody&#8217;s Books, and L.L. Bean, in just a few years. The main reason I go to downtown Berkeley is to take BART to San Francisco.</p>
<p>My neighborhood, North Berkeley, is doing much better, although there are two empty storefronts and the Starbucks will close. Elephant Pharmacy, a New-Agey kind of pharmacy (&#8220;the drugstore that prescribes yoga&#8221;), has been successful and has started opening branches in nearby cities. (It&#8217;s a good place to shop, too. Yesterday I bought some whole nutmeg there.) The Cheese Board, a worker&#8217;s cooperative, with a great selection of cheese, has done a good job adding pizza sales to cheese sales.</p>
<p>The overall economic record of the neighborhood is staggering, since it includes the original Peet&#8217;s, the inspiration for Starbucks, and Chez Panisse, the most influential restaurant in the world. It also includes the first Papyrus store. I don&#8217;t drink coffee, and didn&#8217;t start drinking tea until the Shangri-La Diet, so I never shopped at Peet&#8217;s until recently. A friend, however, has been going there almost its entire history. He says that when Mr. Peet died, the workers became a lot friendlier. Before that they had a snobbish attitude. Some workers from Peet&#8217;s started a similar business in Seattle, which they called Starbucks. It was very successful and they sold out to Howard Schulz, who greatly expanded it.</p>
<p>Was Mr. Peet&#8217;s snobbery &#8220;bad&#8221;? Well, it &#8212; plus the corresponding attitudes of Berkeley residents &#8212; allowed him to develop a unique business. After that business was developed, that attitude could be shed and the whole thing could be moved to a place (Seattle) where its business potential could be revealed. The shift of ownership allowed the idea to become separated from the &#8220;big business is bad&#8221; notion (which was helpful at first) and launch a thousand Starbucks. (An excellent company, by the way, that not only provides me a place to work but also produced <em>How Starbucks Saved My Life</em>, a very good and persuasive book.) This is yet another tiny illustration of my theory of human evolution, how it all started with hobbies which eventually became businesses. Peet&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t a hobby, but it was hobby-like in its expression of the owner&#8217;s attitudes. It was far more a labor of love than most businesses. There are other examples. <em>Survivor</em> is to <em>The Real World</em> as Starbucks is to Peet&#8217;s. <em>The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma</em> is to Slow Food as Starbucks is to Peet&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Why do holidays exist? For the same reason as festivals, ceremonies, and souvenirs: To increase demand for hard-to-make stuff. This helps artisans at the cutting edge make a living. They are the innovators. Helping them advances technology. Our celebration of Independence Day, for example, creates demand for fireworks, firecrackers, and American flags.</p>

					<p>I asked this question in a <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/15/why-do-we-touch-our-mouths-so-much/">recent post</a>. If you look at people sitting in an audience, about one-third of them will be touching their mouth.</p>
<p>I had wondered about this for years. Somehow blogging about it helped. A few days ago I was on the subway. Of the persons sitting, the usual fraction were touching their mouth. Nobody standing was touching their mouth with their hands but now and then I noticed them purse or lick their lips.</p>
<p>Which suggested an answer to my question: We get a small amount of pleasure from touching our mouths. The pleasure declines after it is &#8220;harvested&#8221; and takes several minutes to become available again. This mechanism evolved because it kept our lips moist. At the time it evolved, people spent little time sitting. The pleasure was obtained by pursing or licking your lips, which moistened them. Predictions: 1. if you watch people whose hands are busy, they will purse or lick their lips roughly as often as people in an audience touch their mouths. 2. The more you lick or purse your lips, the less you will touch them with your hands. 3. The more you touch your lips with your hands, the less you will purse or lick them.</p>
<p>Pagophagia (compulsive ice eating) is similar. It is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5244572?dopt=Abstract">caused by anemia</a> (too little iron). In the Stone Age, there was no ice. An intense desire to crunch something in your mouth would have led you to crunch bones. Bone marrow is high in iron. It&#8217;s another mechanism that worked well in the Stone Age but now malfunctions (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with touching your mouth with your hand). <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/117/">My self-experimentation</a> is all about this sort of thing. It&#8217;s easy to sit, so we don&#8217;t sleep well. It&#8217;s easy to be inside in the morning, so we don&#8217;t sleep well. It&#8217;s easy to eat breakfast, so we don&#8217;t sleep well. it&#8217;s easy to avoid faces in the morning, so we get depressed. And so on.</p>

					<p>This photo documents something anyone can notice: While we&#8217;re sitting, we touch our mouths a lot.</p>
<p><img src="http://dl.ziza.ru/other/022008/22/luchshiereklami/02_luchshiereklami.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The photo shows the full faces of 22 men; 7 of them are touching their mouths. I have noticed something similar at many faculty meetings. I started to notice this after I read about its observation in a study designed to measure something else.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known about this for many years but have never read an explanation. Do we enjoy touching our mouths &#8212; or is the absence of touch for a long time unpleasant? If so, why?</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In the journal <em><a href="http://www.incharacter.org/index.php">In Character</a></em>, Simon Baron-Cohen, the autism expert, <a href="http://www.incharacter.org/article.php?article=101">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinicians describe the deep, narrow interests in autism as â€œobsessions,â€ but a more positive description might be â€œareas of expertise.â€ Sometimes the area of expertise a person with autism focuses on appears not to be very useful (e.g., geometric shapes, or the texture of different woods). Sometimes the area of expertise is slightly more useful, though of limited interest to others (e.g., train timetables, or flags of the world). But sometimes the area of expertise can make a real social contribution (such as fixing machines, or solving mathematical problems, or debugging computer software).</p></blockquote>
<p>My guess is that in autism, something is turned off that should be turned on. This allows the rest &#8212; in particular, the rest of what motivatesÂ  us &#8212; to be seen more clearly.Â  Everyone has a tendency toward expertise, says my theory of human evolution. Why everyone? Because everyone suffers from procrastination and the tendency toward expertise is the tendency that causes procrastination: It&#8217;s harder to do something new than to do what you did yesterday. Back in the Stone Age, this tendency toward expertise caused different people to do different hobbies, and become good at them. This was the beginning of occupational specialization.</p>

				<small>Thursday, May 1st, 2008</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Recently I visited some friends whom I hadn&#8217;t seen for a while. You&#8217;re more talkative, they said. I attribute this to flaxseed oil.</p>
<p>I became interested in the effects of flaxseed oil partly because of the aquatic ape hypothesis, the idea that living near water had a big effect on human evolution. During a long period of human prehistory, the theory says, we swam a lot, presumably to catch fish. If we ate lots of fish (high in omega-3) at the same time our brains grew large, it was quite possible that our brains need large amounts of omega-3 to function properly. Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3.</p>
<p>Elaine Morgan, the theory&#8217;s main proponent, has written several books about it, &#8220;each more po-faced [= academically correct] than the last,&#8221; she has said. I have finally read two of them and was pleased to find more scrutiny made the theory more plausible.</p>
<p>Background to the idea that humans were once aquatic is that several mammals have obviously become aquatic &#8212; starting on land they shifted to water. Sea lions, whales, and so on. Birds have become aquatic &#8212; for example, ducks. Insects have become aquatic. Elephants appear to have become aquatic and then terrestrial again &#8212; note how well they can swim. There is ample precedent, in other words.</p>
<p>Humans differ in all sorts of anatomical and physiological ways from other primates and the aquatic ape theory has straightforward explanations for many of them:</p>
<p>1. Humans have subcutaneous fat, other primates don&#8217;t. Other aquatic mammals do. Explanation: The fat serves as insulation.</p>
<p>2. Humans have almost no fur, other primates do. Other aquatic mammals don&#8217;t. Explanation: Fur creates drag in the water. In the air, fur insulates.</p>
<p>3. Humans are bipedal. Explanation: Walking upright keeps the head out of the water, allowing breathing.</p>

				<small>Sunday, April 27th, 2008</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In 2004, anthropologists discovered fossils of tiny human ancestors on an Indonesian island. Called <em>micropygmies</em>, they were about three feet tall. Their brains were smaller than chimpanzee brains. They appeared to be descended from <em>Homo erectus</em> rather than <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p>
<p>They survived until about 20,000 years ago &#8212; which was impressive, since  <em>Homo sapiens</em> reached nearby islands about 50,000 years ago. Why didn&#8217;t the <em>Homo sapiens</em> kill off the micropygmies? <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2047">Jared Diamond was puzzled</a> by this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The discoverers of the Flores micropygmies conclude that they survived on Flores until at least 18,000 years ago (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2047#ref1">1</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2047#ref2">2</a>). To me, that is the most astonishing finding, even more astonishing than the micropygmies&#8217; existence. We know that full-sized <em>H. sapiens</em> reached Australia and New Guinea through Indonesia by 46,000 years ago, that most of the large mammals of Australia then promptly went extinct (probably in part exterminated by <em>H. sapiens</em>), and that the first arrival of behaviorally modern <em>H. sapiens</em> on all other islands and continents in the world was accompanied by similar waves of extinction/extermination. We also know that humans have exterminated competing humans even more assiduously than they have exterminated large nonhuman mammals. How could the micropygmies have survived the onslaught of <em>H. sapiens</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>One could perhaps seek a parallel in the peaceful modern coexistence of full-sized <em>sapiens</em> and pygmy <em>sapiens</em> in the Congo and Philippines, based on complementary economies, with pygmy hunter-gatherers trading forest products to full-sized <em>sapiens</em> farmers. But full-sized <em>sapiens</em> hunter-gatherers 18,000 years ago would have been much too similar economically to micropygmy hunter-gatherers to permit coexistence based on complementary economies and trade. One could also invoke the continued coexistence of chimpanzees and humans in Africa, based on chimps being economically too different from us to compete (very doubtful for micropygmies), and on chimps being too dangerous to be worth hunting (probably true for micropygmies). Then, one could point to the reported survival of the pygmy stegodont elephants on Flores until 12,000 years ago (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2047#ref1">1</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2047#ref2">2</a>): If stegodonts survived so long in the presence of <em>H. sapiens</em>, why not micropygmies as well? Finally, one might suggest that all of the recent dates for stegodonts and micropygmies on Flores are in error [despite the evidence presented in (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2047#ref1">1</a>) and (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2047#ref2">2</a>)], and that both stegodonts and micropygmies became extinct 46,000 years ago within a century of <em>H. sapiens</em>&#8216; arrival on Flores. All of these analogies and suggestions strike me as implausible: I just can&#8217;t conceive of a long temporal overlap of <em>sapiens</em> and <em>erectus</em>, and I am reluctant to believe that all of the dates in (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2047#ref1">1</a>) and (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5704/2047#ref2">2</a>) are wrong. Hence I don&#8217;t know what to make of the reported coexistence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I know, <em>when you have a hammer everything looks like a nail</em>. But I think Diamond is quite wrong about the nature of <em>Homo sapiens</em> economies 50,000 years ago. To Diamond, the big change was the invention of agriculture. Before that, hunter-gatherer; after that, farmer and occupational specialization. I believe there were vast economic changes long before agriculture &#8212; it took a long time to evolve language, and that didn&#8217;t start until there was already plenty of trading. By 50,000 years ago, I&#8217;m sure there was lots of specialization (Person A makes/knows X, Person B makes/knows Y), giving the <em>Homo sapiens</em> all sorts of tools and other useful expertise that the micropygmies didn&#8217;t have. They both hunted and gathered but much larger brains and a vast amount of expertise would have been for naught if they didn&#8217;t hunt and gather different foods. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus">Homo erectus</a> did not have anything like human language, as far as I can tell; therefore they didn&#8217;t have lots of trading or expertise. The two groups could co-exist because their foods were different. I suspect the <em>H. sapiens</em>, able to hunt really large animals, thought small animals, which supported the micropygmies, a waste of time.</p>

				<small>Friday, April 11th, 2008</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In poor countries, cellphones have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html?ei=5087&#038;em=&#038;en=e46d649779a0b9be&#038;ex=1208145600&#038;pagewanted=all">a big anti-poverty effect</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jan Chipchase and his user-research colleagues at Nokia can rattle off example upon example of the cellphoneâ€™s ability to increase peopleâ€™s productivity and well-being, mostly because of the simple fact that they can be reached. Thereâ€™s the live-in housekeeper in China who was more or less an indentured servant until she got a cellphone so that new customers could call and book her services. Or the porter who spent his days hanging around outside of department stores and construction sites hoping to be hired to carry other peopleâ€™s loads but now, with a cellphone, can go only where the jobs are. . . . Over several years, his research team has spoken to rickshaw drivers, prostitutes, shopkeepers, day laborers and farmers, and all of them say more or less the same thing: their income gets a big boost when they have access to a cellphone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the effect I propose that the very first words had:  They helped two traders find each other. Having a word for knife made it much easier for the person who had a knife to trade to find someone who wanted a knife. I was in Guatemala when I ran out of contact-lens solution. Not knowing the Spanish term for it, it was extremely hard to find. Once I knew the Spanish term, it was very easy to find. In a Guatemalan market, I heard a man shout &#8220;toothpaste&#8221; (in Spanish) over and over. He was selling toothpaste.</p>
<p>I think the first words were also the first names; You became identified by the name of what you were good at making (and therefore had to trade, since you made many of them). This information spread, like a cellphone signal, from tower to tower: From one person to another. If you were Mr. X, and someone wanted X, and they said so (&#8220;X?&#8221;), someone would point them to you. All it took were single words.</p>
<p>Later in the article, Chipchase responds to the author, who wonders if more technology is always better. â€œPeople once believed that people in other cultures might not benefit from having books either,â€ he says. I would go further: Not having cellphones is like not having language.</p>

					<p>What&#8217;s art? The <a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=home">2008 Whitney Biennial</a> at the Whitney Museum of American Art provides an answer &#8212; whatever the work of the eighty-odd artists has in common.</p>
<p>The exhibit included some videos, documentaries (Spike Lee), photographs, drawings, and paintings. Most of the work, however, was everyday stuff &#8212; what artist <a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_putnam">Adam Putnam</a> called &#8220;frugal materials&#8221; &#8212; used in unusual ways. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_long">bird excrement</a> (Charles Long)</li>
<li><a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_martinez">automotive paint</a> (Daniel Martinez)</li>
<li><a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_caesar">styrofoam and resin</a> (Jedediah Caesar)</li>
<li><a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_rhoades">CDs and styrofoam balls</a> (Jason Rhoades)</li>
<li><a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_sigal">drywall</a> (Lisa Sigal)</li>
<li><a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_ochoa">rebar and chain-link fence</a> (Ruben Ochoa)</li>
<li>printed matter (many)</li>
</ul>
<p>Collages (e.g., <a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_ackermann">Rita Ackermann</a>) are the school-art-project example of this sort of thing. The goals of the artists seemed to be about 20% beauty, 30% emotional impact, 50% novelty. The Biennial also included old technologies used in new ways: <a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_mullican">Matt Mullican</a> made drawings while hypnotized and then did similar drawings while not hypnotized. An outpost of <a href="http://whitney.org/www/2008biennial/www/?section=artists&#038;page=artist_npr">Neighborhood Public Radio</a> allowed anyone to be on the air for an hour.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/21/my-theory-of-human-evolution-red-stained-glass-edition/">As I&#8217;ve said</a>, I believe the tendencies behind art evolved because they generated material-science research. The tendency to make art caused some people to make new things that required control of materials but weren&#8217;t obviously useful; enjoyment of art meant that others would trade for what they&#8217;d made, allowing artists to spend more time making art. A premium for novelty kept artists on their toes; it pushed them to find new ways of making things. Wandering around the Whitney Biennial, these ideas seemed easy to believe.</p>

					<p>My observations:</p>
<p>1. The first task I used to measure my mental function at frequent intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes) resembled an typical cognitive psych task. It wasn&#8217;t fun and I had to push myself to do it.</p>
<p>2. I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/03/01/why-are-games-powerful-part-1/">made another test</a> to do the same thing based on the <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/02/07/the-lessons-of-bilboquet/">lessons I drew from bilboquet</a>. It consisted of tracking circles around the screen. It was mildly fun.</p>
<p>3. Trying to improve the second test, I made a <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/03/01/why-are-games-powerful-part-2/">third test</a>, which consisted of &#8220;tossing&#8221; the cursor from one point to another &#8212; like throwing darts. In spite of its simplicity, it was/is a lot of fun. Slightly addictive.</p>
<p><a style="border-bottom-style: groove" href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">My theory of human evolution</a> places great emphasis on hobbies (which at first were varieties of tool making) and job specialization. Hobbies must be fun. So that we will do them &#8212; or at least so our Stone Age ancestors would do them &#8212; they must provide pleasure. Where does this pleasure come from? The third task suggests a source: We enjoy simple hand-eye tasks with feedback where there is plenty of room for improvement. The Stone-Age hobbyist is trying to get this or that stone or piece of wood to do what he wants. The importance of job specialization &#8212; people must be able to enjoy a wide range of jobs, and the first jobs derived from hobbies &#8212; implies that the pleasure derived from hobbies must be &#8220;free-floating.&#8221; It cannot be closely tied to any particular hobby; to encourage a wide range of hobbies (= a wide range of tools) it must be generated by a wide range of hobbies. Because it is free-floating, we should be able to generate it from something quite different from a Stone-Age hobby, such as my third test. The Stone-Age hobbies we&#8217;re talking about, ur-technology, involved making things &#8212; which involves hand-eye coordination. The third test was more fun than the first two because it was closer to a Stone-Age hobby.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t yet know if the third test is sensitive to flaxseed oil. I have doubts because it seems to involved only a small amount of mental computation per minute of testing. I believe flaxseed oil improves all brain function, but this test may require too much time (e.g., 20 minutes per session) to see the effect clearly. The other tests show the effect and take about 3 minutes per test. One reason balance clearly showed an effect of flaxseed oil is, I think, that it is computationally very intensive. A huge amount of computation goes on at once. A kind of averaging goes on, making systematic differences larger relative to noise.</p>

					<p>The Sharper Image has gone bankrupt and will <a href="http://consumerist.com/359574/the-sharper-image-suspends-acceptance-of--gift-cards-due-to-bankruptcy?">no longer honor gift cards</a>. In the comments section of the Consumerist post about this, several people apparently fail to understand why gift cards exist:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another reason why cash is a better gift than gift cards.</p>
<p>This is just a good example why you should never buy a gift card.</p>
<p>Did anyone ever NOT know that gift cards are stupid?</p>
<p>The real lesson here, as Consumerists know, is don&#8217;t buy gift cards. They are a bad deal even if the issuer doesn&#8217;t go bankrupt.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the low-rent version of the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article804558.ece">deadweight cost of Christmas</a> idea, which I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2006/12/24/christmas-an-evolutionary-explanation/">discussed earlier</a>. At the risk of stating the obvious, the perfect gift shows you know a lot about the recipient; cash shows you know nothing. A gift card shows you know a little &#8212; where the person likes to shop. They are less wasteful but less gift-like than ordinary gifts, more wasteful and more gift-like than cash. Gifts are <em>supposed</em> to be wasteful. This is why they are nicely wrapped. (Curiously no commenter called <em>gifts</em> stupid, a scam, etc.)  In evolutionary terms, gift-giving traditions evolved because they increased demand for seemingly &#8220;useless&#8221; stuff. Gifts that went unused and expensive wrappings weren&#8217;t actually useless; they helped artists and artisans make a living. They were research grants for material science. </p>

					<p>Will Amy Winehouse &#8212; who won five Grammys last night &#8212; help or hurt the music industry? A few years ago, I went to a tasting event called The Joy of Sake. There were about 100 of the best sakes from Japan. A pre-event talk for retailers discussed the decline of sake in Japan. (Soju is cool; sake is old-fashioned.) That was the reason for the show. I loved tasting 30-odd high-quality sakes but the overall effect on me was the opposite of what the promoters wanted. I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/09/my-theory-of-human-evolution-american-idol-edition/">quickly became a connoisseur</a>. I no longer liked the cheap stuff &#8212; ugh! But the stuff I <em>did</em> like was too expensive. I stopped buying sake. </p>
<p>Before last night I had heard of Amy Winehouse and I had heard Rehab, but hadn&#8217;t put the two together. Her Grammy performance blew me away. I watched a bunch of YouTubes of her. Back at the Grammys, I listened to an orchestra play Rhapsody in Blue. I used to like it; now it sounded awful. I listened to a few more group performances; they too sounded bad. Just as The Joy of Sake had made me no longer enjoy cheap sake, listening to a lot of Amy Winehouse had made me no longer enjoy &#8220;average&#8221; music &#8212; music where several individual performances are combined.</p>
<p>I thought of <em>The Black Swan</em> by Nassim Taleb. Taleb defined <em>Mediocristan</em> as situations where no one datum can have a big effect on the result. The average height of 100 people, for example. In <em>Extremistan</em>, by contrast, a single datum <em>can</em> make a big difference. The average wealth of 100 people, for example &#8212; one person can have much more money than the other 99 put together. Orchestras are Mediocristan, I realized; individual singers are Extremistan. In art, emotional impact is everything. Extremistan allows really big impact; Mediocristan does not. Maybe this is why classical music is dying.</p>
<p>I felt like throwing away half my CDs. I could use the space. Thanks, Amy!</p>

				<small>Tuesday, January 29th, 2008</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Bibloquet appears impossibly difficult, I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/01/25/the-mystery-of-bilboquet/">posted recently</a>. Yet people become very good at it, no doubt through huge amounts of practice. Why?</p>
<p>Now and then I hear about somebody getting very good at a physical skill: A basketball player is very good at free-throw shooting, for example. No doubt the reason is lots of practice. I&#8217;m not surprised because explanation is easy: He played a lot of basketball (social, fun to move around), he wanted to be a pro (aspiration). Professional musicians have practiced a lot &#8212; sure, music sounds good, it&#8217;s their job. Most cases of extreme practice that I know of have plausible common-sense explanations. </p>
<p>Bibloquet skill does not. It leads nowhere, is completely useless (I suspect), isn&#8217;t social, and isn&#8217;t promoted by the environment (there are no bilboquet rooms, for example). Some people spend a huge amount of time playing video games (also useless, etc.), but video games are complicated. Bibloquet is simple. You can see this in the price. A video game might cost $40, not counting the price of the computer it runs on. My bibloquet probably cost about $1. No computer needed. For that $1 I am going to get a huge amount of enjoyment. Hard to think of something else for $1 that would provide so much pleasure.</p>
<p>As Michel Cabanac has argued many times, our brains use pleasure to guide our actions: What we should do is more pleasant than what we shouldn&#8217;t do. Sometimes this system misfires because something man-made resembles what we should be seeking. If your iron level is very low you may suffer from pagophagia &#8212; too much ice chewing. Ice chewing brings persons with pagophagia great pleasure. I&#8217;m sure that the evolutionary reason is that ice chewing is producing the same sensations as bone crunching. Bone crunching would be a good source of iron because bone marrow is iron-rich. The mechanism that causes pagophagia evolved because it promoted bone crunching. Chewing ice resembles bone crunching. What biologically-useful activity does playing bibloquet resemble?</p>
<p>My guess is that bilboquet is addictive because:</p>
<p>1. Success is sharply defined. You catch the ball (success) or not (failure). Other addictive games have this feature. Tetris: you fit the falling shape into the pile at the bottom. Sudoku: You fill in all the squares correctly. </p>
<p>2. Success is not easy. We like a challenge. Most video games, such as Tetris, get harder and harder.</p>
<p>3. Hand-eye coordination is involved.</p>
<p>At the core of human evolution is occupational specialization and diversification. It started with hobbies. To get diversity of hobbies you need diversity of reward; a wide range of skilled activities must be rewarding. Rather than evolve a separate mechanism for each hobby, this was accomplished with a mechanism that is quite flexible and can operate with lots of different activities. Thus the reward system can be transferred to something completely useless, such as bibloquet. The not-too-easy feature caused hobbyists to become more and more skilled because only by continually challenging themselves could they keep enjoying it. Hand-eye coordination was required because the goal was to get people to make things. Why success had to be sharply defined I&#8217;m not so sure. (In art, a similar human activity, success is not sharply defined.) Maybe it serves to focus effort.</p>
<p>The lesson for me is that if I want to produce a task that will measure how well my brain is working and be so much fun it&#8217;s addictive, it should involve hand-eye coordination. (It will be easier to make the many measurements <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/02/24/omega-3-greatest-hits/">my omega-3 research</a> requires if I have such a task.) This is consistent with what I&#8217;ve observed so far: None of the tasks I&#8217;ve used have been addictively fun. The balance task had a fairly sharp and difficult measure of success (staying balanced for more than a few seconds) and was physical but didn&#8217;t involve hand-eye coordination. The digit-span task had a sharp measure of success (perfect recall) and could be made more and more difficult but didn&#8217;t involve hand-eye coordination. Three other tasks I&#8217;ve used had less sharply-defined success and didn&#8217;t involve hand-eye coordination.</p>

					<p>A <a href="http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/VirtualExhibits/bilboquet/pages/index.html">bilboquet</a> is a toy: a ball and stick. The ball has a hole and is attached by a cord to the stick. You toss the ball and impale it with the stick. A friend gave me a Japanese version:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2322/2217107477_344c8cd249.jpg?v=0" alt="bilboquet" /></p>
<p>It seemed impossible to reliably catch the ball on the stick but here is someone who can do it:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HJMRZWff-Hw&#038;rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HJMRZWff-Hw&#038;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>Even better:</p>

<p>How do people get so good at this? I have part of the answer: it is a lot of fun to practice. I have been tracking my progress and I have to restrain myself from doing it more often. Why is it so much fun to practice? </p>
<p>To be continued.</p>

					<p>Therefore it must be wrong. This was the reaction of several prominent anthropologists when Chuck Millikan, a California policeman, wrote to them to ask what they thought of the aquatic ape hypothesis, according to <a href="http://www.ociotube.com/video.php?op=youtube&#038;video=81GnT9tt_IU">Elaine Morgan</a>. Millikan was &#8220;a compulsive letter-writer,&#8221; said Morgan. He had been impressed by her ideas and wrote her to ask when her next book was coming out. There won&#8217;t be a next one, Morgan had replied, I&#8217;ve said all I have to say. Millikan&#8217;s response to this was to write prominent anthropologists asking them what they thought of her theory. When he sent Morgan their replies, she saw they had no good reasons for ignoring her. Emboldening and irritated, she wrote another book.</p>
<p>Let me invent a verb: <em>to elaine morgan</em> something is to have a big effect on something you shouldn&#8217;t have been able to influence. Elaine Morgan elaine morganed the study of evolution. She was far outside anthropology; she shouldn&#8217;t have been able to successfully promote a radical new view of evolution, but she did. Chuck Millikan elaine morganed Elaine Morgan; he shouldn&#8217;t have been able to persuade her to start writing again, but he did.</p>
