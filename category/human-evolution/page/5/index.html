				<small>Saturday, December 22nd, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Someone named Scylla <a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=448717">waterboarded himself</a> and provided a detailed account of what happened. &#8220;Old&#8221; self-experimentation, you could say, was doctors doing dangerous things to themselves for a short time to prove some idea that they already believed (e.g., a dentist using laughing gas as an anesthetic); &#8220;new&#8221; self-experimentation is me doing something perfectly safe for a long time to solve a problem that I have no clue how to solve. What Scylla did is between the two. Short duration, not completely safe, done to find out if waterboarding is torture or not. Scylla had no strong opinion about this when he started.</p>
<p>Before he got to using saran wrap it wasn&#8217;t particularly bad. Here&#8217;s what happened with saran wrap:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea is that you wrap saran wrap around the mouth in several layers, and poke a hole in the mouth area, and then waterboard away. . . . So far I would categorize waterboarding as simply unpleasant rather than torture, but I&#8217;ve come this far so I might as well go on. . . It took me ten minutes to recover my senses once I tried this. I was shuddering in a corner, convinced I narrowly escaped killing myself.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
<p>The water fills the hole in the saran wrap so that there is either water or vacuum in your mouth. The water pours into your sinuses and throat. You struggle to expel water periodically by building enough pressure in your lungs. With the saran wrap though each time I expelled water, I was able to draw in less air. Finally the lungs can no longer expel water and you begin to draw it up into your respiratory tract.</p>
<p>It seems that there is a point that is hardwired in us. When we draw water into our respiratory tract to this point we are no longer in control. All hell breaks loose. Instinct tells us we are dying.</p>
<p>I have never been more panicked in my whole life. Once your lungs are empty and collapsed and they start to draw fluid it is simply all over. You [b]know[/b] you are dead and it&#8217;s too late. Involuntary and total panic.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing you can do about it. It would be like telling you not to blink while I stuck a hot needle in your eye. . .<br />
I never felt anything like it, and this was self-inflicted with a watering can, where I was in total control and never in any danger. And I understood.</p>
<p>Waterboarding gets you to the point where you draw water up your respiratory tract triggering the drowning reflex.</p></blockquote>
<p>This shows something non-obvious: We are hard-wired to avoid drowning and like all good safety systems, the system kicks in well before damage occurs. </p>
<p>For such a system to evolve, humans must have spent a lot of time in water deep enough to drown in. We don&#8217;t now, of course. The sheer fact of Scylla&#8217;s post &#8212; the fact that waterboarding is torture isn&#8217;t obvious &#8212; shows this. </p>
<p>All this &#8212; Scylla&#8217;s initial ignorance, what he experienced and concluded &#8212; is consistent with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis">aquatic ape theory of human evolution</a> and inconsistent with alternatives to that theory (e.g., the savannah theory), which assume no long aquatic phase. Belief that the aquatic ape theory was probably true was one reason I started <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">omega-3 self-experimentation</a>, which led to the discovery of very clear experimental effects.</p>
<p>This interests me not only because of what it says about human evolution &#8212; to me, it&#8217;s substantial new evidence for the aquatic ape theory &#8212; but also for what it says about science. Scylla has no scientific credentials (I assume). His report wasn&#8217;t peer-reviewed. It wasn&#8217;t quantitative. It wasn&#8217;t long. It was closer to an anecdote than a conventional experiment (where you compare two conditions). He wasn&#8217;t trying to test any theory. Yet it provided helpful new info on a major scientific question (human evolution), which is very hard to do.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, November 28th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Sure, you know that in Japan, New Year&#8217;s is the big winter holiday. But did you know that <a href="http://snakelyone.com/osechi.htm">osechi</a>, a kind of fancy bento box, is a holiday tradition? Here are some examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1302/1348073721_250d94d6d6.jpg?v=0" alt="osechi example 1" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/340489552_19dc350f67.jpg?v=0" alt="osechi example 2" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/42/85300583_7268ab75c8.jpg?v=0" alt="osechi example 3" /></p>
<p>The cost, even to an American living in the Bay Area, is . . . surprising:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just about every major department store and supermarket in Japan now stocks osechi ryori cuisine in December. Most stores offer osechi either as individual dishes or as sets, and many pass out elaborate catalogs to make the selection as easy as pulling out your wallet, which better be stuffed if you plan on ordering osechi as a set. . . . Price is determined by contents and the reputation of the wholesaler or restaurant which put it together. For example, a relatively unknown shop may whip up three 20 square centimeter boxes for Â¥22,000 [= $200], whereas Kicho, a famous restaurant in Kyoto offers three circles of the same size for a hefty Â¥196,000 [= $1800]. The rest of the sets, ranging anywhere from one to four tiers cost between Â¥30,000 to Â¥50,000 on average and most Isetan customers buy their ready-made osechi in this price range.</p></blockquote>
<p>Osechi is another example of how holidays <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2006/12/24/christmas-an-evolutionary-explanation/">create a market for expensive difficult-to-make things</a>. The Stone-Age predecessors of holidays helped support skilled artists, artisans, and craftsmen, the technological pioneers of the time. </p>
<p>Addendum: Bento boxes <a href="http://www.lenovoblogs.com/designmatters/?p=72">inspired the design</a> of the IBM Thinkpad.</p>

					<p>The path to human nature, I propose, began with capable hands. No surprise there. In our brains formed a desire for hobbies, to take advantage of what our hands allowed. Hobbies were the first step toward occupational specialization, which led to the full flowering of human nature (trading, language, procrastination, art, holidays, rituals, fine wine, fashion, Veblen&#8217;s Instinct of Workmanship, etc.).</p>
<p>The Hobbyist Within Us is especially clear in the pages of <a href="http://www.makezine.com">Make</a>, a young magazine devoted to higher-tech DIY. <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/11/turn_your_old_scanner_int.html">Turn your old scanner into a camera</a>. <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/11/make_a_joule_thief_weeken.html">Make a Joule thief</a>.

				<small>Tuesday, November 13th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Henry Rosenthal, the San-Francisco-based producer of the documentary <em><a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/devilanddaniel/">The Devil and Daniel Johnston</a></em> (the best movie ever made about mental illness), has a large collection of pennants. No sports teams, no schools, only North America &#8212; those are the rules. Hundreds of pennants. Most are for places (Mexico, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco). A few are for events (a Chicago trade show). &#8220;I&#8217;ve been collecting since early childhood,&#8221; Henry told me. &#8220;I made two pennants myself years ago, one for Joseph Albers and the other for Robert Rauschenberg.&#8221;</p>
<p>For years I wondered why people collect. By <em>collect</em>, I mean collect gift-like objects, such as frog figurines or erasers with pictures or stamps or refrigerator magnets or pennants. I understood it was enjoyable &#8212; you derive pleasure from your collection. It was the evolutionary reason I couldn&#8217;t figure out. When I eventually thought of my theory of human evolution &#8212; it is all about the growth and encouragement of occupational specialization &#8212; I realized this was one of the puzzles it solved.</p>
<p>Will Henry pay more than the average person for new and well-made pennants? Very likely. Will he appreciate an especially well-made pennant more than the rest of us? Undoubtedly. Like most collectors, Henry has placed the items of his collection side by side, making it easy to compare them and, I believe, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/09/my-theory-of-human-evolution-american-idol-edition/">promoting connoisseurship</a>. Studying his collection &#8212; covering the walls and hanging from the ceiling of a large room &#8212; made <em>me</em> a connoisseur of pennants. </p>
<p>Collections increase the demand for finely-made things, helping their makers make a living and advance the state of their art, whatever it might be. that people collect all sorts of finely-made things encourages the growth of a wide range of technologies.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Henry is currently working on a movie about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Tim_%28musician%29">Tiny Tim</a>. If you can&#8217;t wait for the movie, you can read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tiny-Tim-Harry-Stein/dp/087223455X">a book</a> it will be based on.</p>

					<p>The latest episode of <em>Ugly Betty</em> ended with Jeff Buckley&#8217;s version of Leonard Cohen&#8217;s Hallelujah. I was entranced. I <em>ran</em> to YouTube to hear the whole thing:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="355"><param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4LG_qTI-fbQ&#038;rel=1" name="movie" /><param value="transparent" name="wmode" /></object><br />
What a great performance! Could anyone else come close? I usually like Rufus Wainwright:</p>

Not close.</p>
<p>K. D. Lang?</p>

No.</p>
<p>Leonard Cohen himself?</p>

Well, the best of the rest.</p>
<p>I am a lot more interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Buckley">Jeff Buckley</a> than I was an hour ago. From Wikipedia: &#8220;The night before his death [by drowning], Buckley excitedly told his girlfriend Joan Wasser that he believed he had found the cause of his dramatic moods, namely bipolar disorder.&#8221;</p>

					<p>When I watched <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/10/my-theory-of-human-evolution-planet-earth-edition/">Planet Earth</a>, I was impressed that the most successful aquatic animals were <em>mammals</em> (whales and dolphins). Fish had had a huge head start. Mammals such as whales and dolphins had moved back into the water after long evolution on land. Something promoted by terrestrial evolution allowed them to dominate their new world. That &#8220;something&#8221; is probably learning ability, although research on whale learning has yet to be done. </p>
<p>This is one reason the aquatic ape theory of human evolution makes sense. Judging from whales and dolphins, a little brain power can go a long way. Early humans had not only brains but hands. The combination made sea creatures extremely vulnerable. The threat was so flexible and different than previous threats they couldn&#8217;t tweak a few genes and escape. To take advantage of this new food source, humans had to wade into the water &#8212; the presumed initial reason (by those who believe in the aquatic ape theory) for bipedality.</p>
<p>Anthropologists at Arizona State <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-10/asu-rfe101207.php">recently reported evidence</a> that early humans did indeed live on coastlines, with ready access to fish and shellfish. Other researchers had found evidence of this as early as 120,000 years ago; the new evidence pushes the date of earliest coastline habitation even earlier, to about 160,000 years ago. </p>
<blockquote><p>â€œWe also found what archaeologists call bladelets â€“ little blades less than 10 millimeters in width, about the size of your little finger,â€ [one of the anthropologists] says. â€œThese could be attached to the end of a stick to form a point for a spear, or lined up like barbs on a dart â€“ which shows they were already using complex compound tools.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have watched <em>Survivor</em>, you will remember tools much like that being used to catch fish. </p>

					<p><a href="http://www.beyondwonderful.com/experts/cheese/content_cheese.htm">Mark Todd</a> (thecheesedude at aol dot com) is a cheese expert who lives near the Russian River. Today he was in a local store demoing a cheese (<a href="http://www.fondofoods.com/download/SF_Chronicle_9_21_070001.pdf">Chiantino</a>) that <a href="http://www.fondofoods.com">he and his business partner</a> import from Germany. We had a long and utterly fascinating conversation. He has met most of the chefs who appear on the Food Network. His favs:</p>
<p>The best cook: Jacques Pepin &#8220;hands down&#8221;. </p>
<p>The most knowledgeable food expert: <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/">Alton Brown</a>. &#8220;He knows ten times more than all the rest of them put together.&#8221;</p>
<p>How did he become a cheese expert, I asked. &#8220;Persistence,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>The details of that persistence were not what I expected. When he was 30, his dad, who was 58, died of a massive heart attack. At the time, he was a lawyer. He hated it. What do I really want to do? he wondered. Something with food. He and his wife moved from crowded Palo Alto to near the Russian River. At a food event in the months that followed, he met someone who was paid to carve cheese. Wow, you can get paid for that, he thought. He asked the guy if he needed help. No, he didn&#8217;t. He and his wife hung out with the guy and his girlfriend. Several months later, the guy told him he needed help at an upcoming event in Monterey. He went down and helped and was paid $500/day in addition to free hotel for him and his wife and conference admission (usually $750). After the conference, he contacted the guy&#8217;s boss. &#8220;I want to do this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What do you know about cheese?&#8221; he was asked. &#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, then you&#8217;re no use to us,&#8221; he was told. Two weeks later he called the boss again. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read four books about cheese,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you have any work for me?&#8221; No, he was told. &#8220;I really want to do this,&#8221; he said. He called the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. Finally the boss said, &#8220;I get it. You really want to do this.&#8221; And he was hired for six figures a year to go here and there and talk about cheese. Now he works for many cheese organizations. Next week he&#8217;s going to China to teach them about California cheeses.</p>
<p>I told him I was interested in how people come to appreciate &#8220;fine&#8221; food. Exposure, he said. &#8220;Are some exposures more powerful than others?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Peer exposure,&#8221; he said. When he was a sophomore in college (at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo), he didn&#8217;t like beer. He decided he wanted to learn about wine. One of his roommates had been to Napa and come back with notes. Teach me about wine, he said to his roommate. It takes time, his roommate said. They decided that Wednesday would be Wine Night. Every Wednesday for the next two years, he, his roommate, and another guy went to Safeway and bought three versions of the same varietal &#8212; e.g., three Chardonnays. Then they did blind tastings. His palate became better than most of the guys in the wine business, he said. Side-by-side tastings are crucial, he said. If you taste 500 cheeses on 500 different days, you won&#8217;t know much. But if you taste those cheeses side by side, you&#8217;ll learn a lot.</p>
<p>As wallpaper patterns, store displays, and millions of graphic designs reveal, we like to see similar things side by side. I have blogged <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/09/my-theory-of-human-evolution-american-idol-edition/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/27/my-theory-of-human-evolution-music-video-edition/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/10/my-theory-of-human-evolution-diet-soda-edition/">here</a> about side-by-side comparisons and human evolution.</p>

					<p>From a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/books/review/Chen-t.html?ref=review">review</a> of <a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/fall07/006562.htm">The Surgeons: Life and Death in a Top Heart Center</a> by Charles Morris:</p>
<blockquote><p>For better or for worse, the quality of health care is driven by what Morris calls an â€œartisanalâ€ value system, one that has little to do with institutional allegiances or administrative management objectives, but rather with â€œinternalized systems of ethics and the expectations of other professionals.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>My theory of human evolution says it started with hobbies. Hobbyists became artisans. It hadn&#8217;t occurred to me that an &#8220;artisanal&#8221; value system exists but what Morris says makes sense. Such a value system should be powerful, easy to spread, and hard to eliminate.</p>

					<p>At Language Log, <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004974.html">Mark Liberman</a> has an excellent discussion of a new paper that reports a correlation between voice pitch and number of children for men in a hunter-gatherer population. Men with deeper voices had more children. This portion of Liberman&#8217;s post surprised me:</p>
<blockquote><p>This particular form of sexual dimorphism is apparently not shared with our relatives the chimps and gorillas, so it must have evolved during the same period that human speech and language did. Therefore, starting at some point during the last five million years or so, there must have been a selective advantage for male hominins with lower voices. And according to the featured study (C.L. Apicella, D.R. Feinberg, F.W. Marlowe, &#8220;Voice pitch predicts reproductive success in male hunter-gatherers&#8221;, Biology Letters, published online 9/25/2007), evidence of this selective advantage can still be found today.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with all of this. The puzzle is that the effect remains. Five million years is a long time; shouldn&#8217;t the dimorphism have gotten larger and larger until an equilibrium was reached, and then stayed at that equilibrium? Once equilibrium is reached it will be the average voice pitch that is most successful.</p>
<p>I can think of several possible answers. </p>
<p>1. The correlation is due to random variation. Because lots of surveys have shown that women prefer men with deeper voices, this is less plausible.</p>
<p>2. Evolution is still happening on this dimension. That is, equilibrium hasn&#8217;t yet been reached.</p>
<p>3. This particular tribe was pushed away from equilibrium for an extended time &#8212; that is, for a long time higher-pitched men&#8217;s voices were more advantageous than usual. Whatever caused that has disappeared so this group is moving back toward equilibrium. </p>
<p>4. It&#8217;s about signalling. The voice-pitch variation observed in populations is mostly due not to genetic variation but to early environment (say, testosterone in the womb) and is correlated with something less visible that makes a difference in the reproductive success of one&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>I imagine the authors of the paper favor #4. When the full text is available for free, I&#8217;ll find out and post again.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>After reading <a href="http://www.christinekenneally.com/">Christine Kenneally</a>&#8216;s <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/books/01grim.html">The First Word: The Search for the Origins of Language</a></em> (2007) I could see that most theorists agree with me that language must have started small: With single words. None of the theorists seem to use my other guiding principle: <em>Lightning doesn&#8217;t strike twice in one place for different reasons</em>. If two rare events &#8212; such as (a) a sound in the night that sounds like a burglar and (b) in the morning your wallet is gone &#8212; might be due to the same thing, they probably are. Use of this principle means that how language evolved should fit into a larger explanation.</p>
<p>Humans differ from our closest primate relatives &#8212; not to mention all other species &#8212; in many ways, of course. One big difference is language; but there are many others. Application of the lightning-strikes-twice principle means that language probably began for the same reason as the other differences. </p>
<p>The overwhelming difference between humans and other species is that humans specialize in terms of jobs. Two randomly-selected people almost surely make their living doing quite different things all day. No other species does this. Two randomly-selected members of any other species almost surely make their living doing the same thing all day. The story I am trying to tell in my human evolution posts is how humans came to specialize like this. (I believe the aquatic ape theory is right, but it&#8217;s about an earlier stage of human evolution, before job specialization.) </p>
<p>For me, the question of how language evolved becomes the question: How did single-word language promote job specialization? This has an obvious answer: It promoted trade, which job specialization obviously requires. The first words were nouns &#8212; in particular, the names of objects (chair, knife, bag, etc.). These words promoted trade because:</p>
<p>1. They served as advertising. It became much easier to tell others that you or someone else had something to trade. It&#8217;s weird that there is no word for the other side of the picture: Wanting something. Single words also made it much easier to broadcast that there was something you wanted.</p>
<p>2. They emphasized function. The words <em>chair</em>, <em>knife</em>, and <em>bag</em> describe the function of the objects they name. Objects have many other qualities, of course: color, location, ownership, age, materials, etc. Common words tend to hide those qualities and emphasize function. Trades based on function became easier to arrange than trades based on desires for other qualities. The first words helped people trade for stuff they could use, in other words. </p>
<p>Single words work perfectly as advertising. They are still used this way. In a Guatemalan market, I heard a man shout the Spanish word for &#8220;toothpaste&#8221; over and over. Lots of businesses use single words on their signs to indicate what they sell. Early names, moreover, reflected what a person would have to give in trade: Smith, for example. </p>
<p>People who criticize evolutionary explanations sometimes say it is impossible to have evidence. Not so. In the case of language, you can examine how single words are used today. Sure, new ways of using language have grown up; but they are unlikely to have made old uses impossible. There are dozens of things you <em>can&#8217;t</em> do with single words. But you certainly can advertise and request (&#8220;fork?&#8221;). </p>

					<p>On the <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.com/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=192">Meet the Pros</a> episode of <em>This American Life</em>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rakoff">David Rakoff</a> said</p>
<blockquote><p>I make stuff: boxes, lamps, mirrors, small folding screens, painted jackets for kids, that sort of thing. It&#8217;s what I do in my spare time. Some people exercise; my salvation lies in time spent alone with an Xacto knife and commercial-grade adhesive. During the act of making something, I experience a kind of blissful absence of self and a loss of time. I almost cannot get this feeling any other way. . . . I once spent 16 hours making 150 wedding invitations by hand and was not for one instant of that day tempted to check the time.</p></blockquote>
<p>He gives the stuff he makes as gifts to his friends. A <em>Martha Stewart Living</em> staffer tells Rakoff it is harder to do this sort of thing for a living than as a hobby.<br />
<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/27/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/"><br />
My theory of human evolution</a>, which explains how we became the only species whose members make their living in many diverse ways, says the sequence was: 1. Hobbies. 2. Part-time jobs. 3. Full-time jobs. The first hobbies obviously involved making things and were the beginnings of craftsmanship. That many of us, such as Rakoff, enjoy crafts indicates that those early genes are still there.</p>
<p>Before trading evolved, you gave the products of your specialized skill to your friends, which generated a vague obligation. This was the precursor of trading. In contrast to trading, of course, in this case the recipients may have only a little use for what they receive.</p>

					<p>An interesting <em>Economist</em> <a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9762790">article </a>about sex differences in a visual task calls an evolutionary explanation a &#8220;just-so story.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know if the late <a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/">Stephen Jay Gould</a>, evolutionary theorist, Harvard professor, and &#8220;one of the most influential and widely-read writers of popular science of his generation&#8221; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould">Wikipedia</a>), invented this form of dismissal, but certainly he was fond of it. <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/gould/excerpts/index.html">Here</a>, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Evolutionary biology has been severely hampered by a speculative style of argument that . . . tries to construct historical or adaptive explanations for why this bone looked like that or why this creature lived here. These speculations have been charitably called &#8220;scenarios&#8221;; they are often more contemptuously, and rightly, labeled &#8220;stories&#8221; (or &#8220;just-so stories&#8221; if they rely on the fallacious assumption that everything exists for a purpose). Scientists know that these tales are stories; unfortunately, they are presented in the professional literature where they are taken too seriously and literally.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, this is seriously wrong. My work contains several just-so stories &#8212;  evolutionary explanations of the <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/117/">morning-faces effect</a> and of <a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">the mechanism behind the Shangri-La Diet</a>, for example. My <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/27/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">theory of human evolution</a> might be called a just-so saga.</p>
<p>These explanations made me (at least) believe more strongly in the result or theory they explained &#8212; which turned out to be a good thing. My morning-faces result was at first exceedingly implausible. The evolutionary explanation encouraged me to study it more. After repeating it hundreds of times I no longer need the evolutionary explanation to believe it but the explanation may help convince others to take it seriously. The evolutionary explanation connected with the Shangri-La Diet had the same effect. My evolutionary explanation of the <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/117/">effect of breakfast on sleep</a> led me to do the experiment that discovered the morning-faces effect. My theory of human evolution led me to try <a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/2005_diversityinlearning.pdf">new ways of teaching</a>, with good results. </p>
<p>Why did Gould make this mistake? Thorstein Veblen wrote about our fondness for &#8220;invidious comparisons.&#8221; We like to say our X is better than someone else&#8217;s X. Sure, evolutionary explanations may be hard to test. That doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re worthless. Like many scientists, Gould failed to grasp that <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/05/something-is-better-than-nothing/">something is better than nothing</a>.</p>
<p>Addendum: Perhaps the <em>Economist</em> writer had read a recent <a href="http://www.badscience.net/?p=518#more-518">Bad Science column</a> that began:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want you to know that I love evolutionary psychologists, because the ideas, like â€œgirls prefer pink because they need to be better at hunting berriesâ€ are so much fun. Sure there are problems, like, we donâ€™t know a lot about life in the pleistocene period through which humans evolved; their claims sound a bit like â€œjust soâ€ stories, relying on their own internal, circular logic; the existing evidence for genetic influence on behaviour, emotion, and cognition, is coarse; they only pick the behaviours which they think they can explain while leaving the rest; and they get themselves in massive trouble as soon as they go beyond examining broad categories of human behaviors across societies and cultures, becoming crassly ethnocentric.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;They only pick the behaviours which they think they can explain&#8221; &#8212; how dare they!<strong></p>

					<p><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">My theory of human evolution</a> assumes that art evolved because it acted like a ramp. It helped bridge the technical gap between one useful tool and the next. Tools have the property that <em>almost</em> all the necessary knowledge is no help. If you have 90% of  the technical knowledge you need to build a gun, you can&#8217;t build a gun that works 90% as well as an actual gun; in fact, you won&#8217;t be able to build a useful gun at all. The point is even clearer with computers: Until you have a vast amount of technical knowledge, you can&#8217;t build even the crudest possible computer. When you finally get enough knowledge to build a very crude but working version, then increases in technical knowledge will help you improve it. But eventually you will reach a ceiling where more technical knowledge has little payoff. This state of affairs is shown by the &#8220;without art&#8221; function of this graph:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1075/1316796075_c5565b5ec0.jpg?v=0" alt="the function of art" /></p>
<p>Art is different. Because we value novelty in art, and improvements in technology have obvious effects (e.g., new colors, brighter colors, sharper lines), each little improvement in technology &#8212; in the &#8220;state of the art&#8221; &#8212; is rewarded, long before that increase in knowledge helps build something more conventionally useful. Artists were the first material scientists.</p>
<p>Support for my assumption that evolution can build such ramps comes from a little-known psychological effect called <em><a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1338316&#038;blobtype=pdf">quasi-reinforcement</a></em> discovered by Allen Neuringer and Shin-Ho Chung. Suppose you require a pigeon to peck a key 300 times to get food. It will peck, but slowly. Now you change the situation so that every 20 pecks a light comes on for a few seconds. Although the pigeon will not peck a key simply to turn on a light, this change will roughly double the peck rate &#8212; a huge increase given that food per peck hasn&#8217;t changed. It&#8217;s like doubling the amount of work you get from an employee without a salary increase. I use this effect daily. Given any large task, I break it into much smaller tasks and mark the completion of each one. A friend of mine found it helped to make a mark on a piece of paper each time she read a textbook page. The quasi-reinforcement effect is essentially a ramp that helps us do long tasks that would otherwise pay off only when completed.</p>
<p>To me, blogging is a kind of ramp: It breaks a big task (e.g., writing about my omega-3 research) into much smaller parts with reward after each one. </p>

					<p>In this <a href="http://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/070514_theperfectwave.mp3">podcast</a>, <em>New Yorker</em> writer Burkhard Bilger talks about the guitars of Ken Parker. A lot of research goes into them. I propose that we enjoy music because enjoyment of music creates demand for musical instruments, which leads to material-science research. My previous <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/27/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">earlier posts</a> about human evolution have said something like this &#8212; art generates research &#8212; several times. Previous examples were visual.</p>
<p>Josh McDermott, a psychologist at MIT, has compared human and animal responses to music. From an in-press <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jhm/www/mcdermott_tempo.pdf">paper</a>:<br />
When presented with a choice between slow tempo musical stimuli, including lullabies, and silence, tamarins and marmosets preferred silence whereas humans, when similarly tested, preferred music. . . .There appear to be motivational ties to music that are uniquely human.</p>

					<p>Plausibility of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis">Aquatic Ape</a> Theory of Human Evolution is one reason I started studying the effects of omega-3s. Novelist Elizabeth Bear <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/16/AR2007081602653.html">doesn&#8217;t like it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Doris] Lessing appears to have drawn her background from Elaine Morgan&#8217;s notorious pseudoscientific tome, <em>The Descent of Woman</em> (1972), which argues that human evolution was shaped by a seal-like return to the sea. Crackpot theories can make for great fiction but in this case . . . </p></blockquote>
<p>That I found beneficial effects of omega-3s many times supports the &#8220;crackpot&#8221; theory.</p>

					<p>The many-hour BBC documentary <em>Planet Earth</em>, mentioned <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/04/my-theory-of-human-evolution-amazoncom-edition/">earlier</a>, takes viewers way off the beaten track &#8212; deep into giant caves, for example. But humans &#8212; and human evolution &#8212; creep in. </p>
<p>Non-human primates are shown a dozen-odd times during the series. Only once do we see them walk erect: When baboons wade into a flooded area of Africa. This adds credence to the Aquatic Ape theory of human evolution, which assumes our ancestors came to walk upright because it helped them walk in water. David Attenborough, <em>Planet Earth</em>&#8216;s narrator, made an excellent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/scarsofevolution.shtml">radio show</a> about the Aquatic Ape theory.</p>
<p>The Aquatic Ape theory explains all sorts of physical differences between man and our closest primate ancestors &#8212; why we walk upright and they don&#8217;t, for example. My ideas about human evolution are about what happened next. I try to explain ways we differ mentally from other primates &#8212; we speak, for example. The core idea of my theory is that the human brain has changed in many ways to promote occupational specialization. For example, language &#8212; single words &#8212; began because it facilitated trade; it was the first advertising. (I think of a Guatemalan market where someone shouted &#8220;toothpaste&#8221; over and over. He was selling toothpaste.)</p>
<p>The magic of occupational specialization also comes up in <em>Planet Earth</em>. The &#8220;Planet Earth Diaries&#8221; (Making-of) section of &#8220;Seasonal Forests&#8221; describes filming baobab trees using a unique hot-air balloon designed for photography by Dany Cleyet-Marrel and piloted by him. Twice he flies into trees by mistake. &#8220;Many of <em>Planet Earth</em>&#8216;s finest images would have been impossible without devoted and passionate specialists like Dany,&#8221; says Attenborough.</p>

					<p>A fascinating <a href="http://www.potters.org/subject88449.htm">discussion</a> about the art and business of pottery, such as:</p>
<blockquote><p>I used to make bowls of many colors, then one day I realized that my stock of colors of bowls on the shelves was increasing, but I had no blue bowls. It dawned on me that I was selling off everything blue, and bringing home all the other colors. So I now make only blue stuff. And mostly bowls. Why? 95% of my customers are ladies, and every lady needs a good bowl. And it shows in my sales. Now, I confess to playing a bit now and then and making the occasional ornamental bean pot, or platter, or bread baker. But those are not my mainstay. That is bowls. Bowls and pots with a commercial attitude &#8230;. I stay away from art and craft shows &#8211; too expensive for what they do. I try and sell in a fifty mile radius of where I live and that seems to work. And I try to simply make good pots.</p></blockquote>

				<small>Saturday, August 4th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>Spy</em> magazine had a wonderful column by <a href="http://www.ellisweiner.com/">Ellis Weiner</a> called &#8220;How to Be a Grown-up&#8221;. (In one column, Weiner pointed out that <em>homeless</em>, applied to beggars, should be <em>houseless</em>.) Gordy Slack, a Bay Area science writer, has written the first book that might be called <em>How to be a Grown-up About Evolution</em>. It is an account of the Dover, PA trial in which parents sued the school board for requiring that intelligent design be mentioned in biology class. The actual title is <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Battle-Over-Meaning-Everything-Intelligent/dp/0787987867">The Battle Over the Meaning of Everything</a></em>. (I&#8217;ve known Gordy for years and he wrote about me for <em><a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/2007/3/1/24/1/">The Scientist</a></em>.)</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Gordy sympathizes with the parents (the anti-creationists). But he tries to understand the other side rather than demonize it, which is what is grown-up about his book. One reason for this attitude is that his father is on the other side. His father, at one point a professor of psychology at Harvard, became at age 51 a born-again Christian and a creationist. In 1998, his father took Gordy to meet Philip Johnson, the Berkeley law professor who is the father of intelligent design (ID), a big-tent version of creationism. &#8220;Give us five or ten years, and you&#8217;ll see scientific breakthroughs biologists hadn&#8217;t dreamed of before ID,&#8221; Johnson told Gordy. </p>
<p>While writing the book, Gordy happened to interview Joan Roughgarden, a Stanford biology professor whose specialty is evolution.</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought our interview was going well. But when I told her that I was writing a book about ID in order to understand what drove its proponents, her attitude and demeanor swung around 180 degrees. . . .&#8221;They want to define me [Roughgarden is a transsexual] as inhuman,&#8221; she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>How dare anyone try to understand the other side! (Roughgarden&#8217;s <a href="http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2003/4/25/psychologyLectureLacksSensitivityToSexualOrientation">reaction</a> to a psychology talk she didn&#8217;t like.) The notion that the solution to intolerance is more intolerance is remarkably popular, which is why <em>The Battle Over the Meaning of Everything</em> really stands out.</p>
