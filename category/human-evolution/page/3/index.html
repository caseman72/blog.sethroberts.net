					<p>A Chinese teacher in Los Angeles named Yang Yang, whom you can see in <a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTEzNjk1NDg=.html">this video</a>, wrote this on <a href="http://www.yoyochinese.com/">her website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that we all have our own niche &#8211; something so unique and  innate to us that we enjoy every second of it and can naturally do  better than others. Teaching Chinese is my niche.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is the beginning of wisdom about human diversity &#8212; a big improvement over judging people by how &#8220;smart&#8221; they are, as so often happens. (To a college professor, smart = able to imitate a college professor.) <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">My theory of human evolution</a> emphasizes the need for diversity of occupations. In ancient times, occupational diversity arose because different people enjoyed doing different things.</p>
<p>But I also think Yang Yang is wrong in two ways. First, I don&#8217;t think your niche is innate. I think it can be changed. I think we can come to enjoy and excel at many jobs that we do not enjoy at first. This is the other side of procrastination. Just as we dislike doing things simply because we haven&#8217;t done them in a long time, we like doing things simply because we did them yesterday. Habits are pleasant.</p>
<p>I also think that where you fall on a pro-status-quo/anti-status-quo (conformist/rebel) dimension is not innate. I think it has a lot to do with your birth order (first-borns are more pro-status-quo), as Frank Sulloway says in <em>Born to Rebel</em>. I didn&#8217;t read Amy Chua&#8217;s <em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</em> expecting to think about birth order and rebelliousness but that&#8217;s what I ended up thinking about.</p>

<blockquote><p>He is known in Catalan as the caganer. That translates most politely  as &#8216;the defecator&#8217; &#8211; and there he is, squatting under a tree with his  trousers down.</p>
<p>At the nearby Christmas market amid the sprigs of holly and  Santa hats rows of miniature, crouching country boys are lined up for  sale.</p>
<p>Innocuous-looking from the front, their buttocks are bare and each one has a small, brown deposit beneath.</p>
<p><span class="cross-head" /></p>
<p id="story_continues_2">&#8220;It&#8217;s typical of Catalonia. Each house  buys one for Christmas,&#8221; explains Natxo with a smile and a shrug as he  shops. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why (we do it), it&#8217;s just a tradition.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="story_continues_2">Without Christmas, there would be much less demand for these intricate items. I believe the evolutionary reason for festivals and ceremonies is that they create demand for hard-to-make goods. This helps the most skilled artisans (good sources of innovation) make a living and hone their skills.</p>

					<p>According to <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/11/08/a-theory-of-human-evolution-and-application-to-education/">my theory of human evolution</a>, a liking for ceremonies evolved because ceremonies increased innovation. Ceremonies increase demand for hard-to-make stuff, which helps the most skilled artisans make a living.</p>

					<p>A week ago I went to a cognitive science conference in Chongqing, where I gave a talk called &#8220;A Theory of Human Evolution and Application to Education&#8221; (a theme of the conference was education). A sponsor of the conference, a magazine called <em>Scientific Chinese</em>, will publish short versions of the talks. Here is the short version of my talk, only a little different than <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">what I&#8217;ve said before</a> but far more compact.<br />

					<p>Waiting in line at Tokyo immigration control, I met a woman from North Carolina who&#8217;d come to Japan for an organized tour of Japanese baseball parks (17 of them). She learned about the tour from a friend. In America, she&#8217;s visited 117.</p>
<p>I told her I was a psychology professor and had <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">a theory of evolution</a> in which connoisseurship played a big role. She was a baseball-park connoisseur, I said.</p>
<p>The evolutionary role of connoisseurs and collectors was to provide demand for finely-made stuff &#8212; things made by state-of-their-art artisans. Connoisseurs and collectors would pay more for features that had no clear value otherwise. By trading for these things, the connoisseurs and collectors helped the artisans make a living and thereby push their technology further.</p>

					<p>In <a href="http://www.edo-tokyo-museum.or.jp/english/">a museum about the history of Tokyo</a>, I saw an exhibit that showed a typical Tokyo home from hundreds of years ago. It contained an elaborate good-luck charm next to the shrine. I realized that good-luck charms can be explained by <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">my theory of human evolution</a> as another example of behavior &#8212; along with art, ceremonies, and <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2006/12/24/christmas-an-evolutionary-explanation/">gift-giving norms</a> &#8211; that long ago supported technical progress. This particular good-luck charm was hard to make. Because people wanted them, they bought them. This helped support skilled craftsmen, who were the ones who made technical progress. Along the same lines, ceremonies usually involve lots of high-end hard-to-make stuff, such as fine clothes.</p>
<p>Visiting distant big cities has taught me a lot about human nature. The big examples are the Shangri-La Diet (Paris) and the umami hypothesis (a earlier Tokyo visit led me to make a lot of miso soup, which had surprising effects). Trips to Antigua (single words make it easy to trade), Toronto (gifts support technical progress), and now Tokyo (again) helped me think about human evolution.</p>

					<p>I read somewhere that <a href="http://www.brentpottenger.com/">Brent Pottenger</a> (blog <a href="http://epistemocrat.blogspot.com/">here</a>) had benefited from adopting an ancestral diet. (Brent, Aaron Blaisdell and I are organizing <a href="http://www.ancestryfoundation.org/">the Ancestral Health Symposium</a>.) I asked him for details. His answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had debilitating migraines and chronic sinus infections for  years, despite being a top-performing multi-sport athlete and following  Conventional Wisdom (Food Pyramid, etc.) nutritional recommendations  diligently. I&#8217;ve always been interested in living as healthy as  possible, so I had made sure to do things like eat lots of whole grains.  Essentially, components of my diet were causing chronic inflammation,  but I did not know it. As a result, I had to take antibiotics (Z packs,  erythromycin, amoxicillin, etc.) repeatedly for many years (a scary  thing in light of the importance of gut flora), usually about 5 to 10  times per year for infections. My migraines got so bad that I had to  go to the emergency room four times during a 1.5 year span to get pain  medications because my prescription migraine drugs and painkillers (like  Vicodin) did not work. The migraines were so painful that I would shut  down and could not even take a nap to let them pass.</p>
<p>I talked about it in part at BIL:PIL:</p>

<p>I did not set out  to cure myself, but that&#8217;s what happened. I started down what turned out  to be the right health path because I read Nassim Taleb&#8217;s <em>The Black  Swan</em>. In that book, Nassim referenced Art DeVany. I read Art&#8217;s work on Evolutionary Fitness. Nassim and Art dovetail  nicely, and the idea that evolution could inform health decisions made  sense to me. That nudged me to cut grains (and other things) out of my  diet. Art also tipped me to Mark Sisson, and I related really well to  Mark&#8217;s personal story as an athlete with a passion for health, and I  enjoyed the logic behind his Primal Blueprint framework. From there, I  got actively involved in what I call the Ancestral Health  epistemocracyÂ that has emerged in the blogosphere&#8211;Mark, Art, Robb Wolf,  Matt Metzgar, Tim Penn, and I actually co-authored an unpublished book  together in 2007. At this point, though, I still did not know that I had  resolved my health problems for good; I just knew that these ideas were  working&#8211;I gained lean muscle mass, had more energy, felt great, etc.&#8211;as I tested them on my own body. Through this involvement as both  an e-patient and a hobbyist blogger/essayist, I realized that a few  years had passed and I had not experienced a migraine or a sinus  infection. Now, after over three years without a migraine and having  only been ill one time, I realize that I cured myself nutritionally, as  a side-effect of tinkering with the aforementioned ideas.  During this process, I also found out about your work from Nassim. For  lots of reasons, your work on self-experimentation seemed really  valuable to me. For example, my neurologist examined me and prescribed  some drugs that were, looking back, quite dangerous to take for a  problem that was caused by things like grains, legumes, processed  vegetable oils, and Conventional Wisdom nutritional guidelines. My  self-experimentation was, ironically, much safer and ultimately more  sophisticated from a philosophy of science perspective because I could  react to local feedback that my neurologist did not have access to: my  own body. From there, I realized that we are all experts in our own body  and that physicians must partner with us respectfully if they want to  act as agents who help us find cures for health problems. I&#8217;ve written about my experiences in bits and pieces  elsewhere, but this is a brief synopsis that captures most of the  highlights in one place.</p>
<p>Basically, thanks to an  inquiring mind and persistence that I owe to my mom&#8217;s mentorship, I  transformed my physiology remarkably thanks to trial-and-error solution  searching with things I learned from Nassim, Art, Mark, and you. From  there, I&#8217;ve added more &#8220;maps&#8221; into my portfolio of health practices from  Doug McGuff, Keith Norris, Kurt Harris, and many others (many are  listed on the Symposium presenter list). As a result, I no longer consume health-care  resources and these resources can go to treat real medical  problems. How remarkable were the improvements? One way to capture that besides the  disappearance of my health problems is to look at my weight changes: at  the same waist size, I&#8217;ve gone from 135 lbs. in 2002 to ~145 lbs. in  2004 to ~170 in 2010. That says something.</p></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>He later added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Things I did to relieve my migraines that didn&#8217;t work:</p>
<div>
<div>-  prescription glasses (theory = eye strain)</div>
<div>- cutting out  caffeine (theory = ? stress)</div>
<div>- napping more (theory = better  sleep)</div>
<p>None of those experiments cured my health  challenges. Only nutrition worked. Very few environmental  factors have fluctuated much over the past ten years: I&#8217;ve lived in the  same hours, slept in the same bed, been a student, played the same  sports in the same places around town, etc.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>His old diet and his new diet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pre-Ancestral Health diet: I followed the Food Pyramid and  associated concepts closely, so I consumed lots of whole grains (breads,  pastas, granola, bagels, etc.), fruits (whole and juiced), vegetables,  non-fat milk, non-fat yogurt, some meat (all kinds), coffee, tea, beans  (black, pinto, others), and some cheese (pasteurized) and nuts. I ate  things like Cliff Bars, drank Odwalla smoothies, etc.</p>
<p>Ancestral Health diet: I follow a very carnivorous  paradigm, so I consume lots of meats (from pork bellies to raw Ahi tuna)  and eggs, lots of cultured butter, coconut butter &#038; oil, full-lipid  Greek Yogurt (highest saturated fat content of any yogurt on the  market), some vegetables (onions, avocados, greens) and mushrooms  (sauteed in butter with onions and meats), essentially no fruit (I&#8217;m in a  &#8216;Fructose Detox&#8217; self-experiment), a little raw cheese, coffee, tea,  essentially no alcohol. I also supplement with some Vitamin D, which is anabolic I think as well. I take fish oil when I have not had fish for awhile. I&#8217;ve eaten fish my entire life, though.</p>
<p>I attribute my health improvements directly (and  completely) to diet. As my diet evolved, I also altered how I train,  transitioning a bit from &#8216;some long-distance running and sports playing&#8217;  to &#8216;mainly high-intensity, short-duration training (more weights and  sprinting) and still sports playing as my exercise approaches. This  energy expenditure evolution has, in my opinion, contributed to my stark  body composition changes (lean muscle mass gain), but I think that my  health improvements are due to diet and that my body composition would  be much worse off if my diet had not changed like it has.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will comment on this in my next post.</p>

				<small>Friday, March 5th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here&#8217;s something I wrote a few days ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>In graduate school, I studied experimental psychology. I wanted to learn how to do experiments. The best way to learn is to do, I <strong>thought</strong>, so I started doing self-experiments in addition to my regular research (with rats). One thing I studied was my acne. My dermatologist had prescribed tetracycline and benzoyl peroxide. In a few months, my self-experiments showed that tetracycline didn&#8217;t work and benzoyl peroxide did work &#8212; the opposite of what I originally <strong>believed</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added. I wanted to write &#8220;the opposite of what I originally thought&#8221; but the earlier use of <em>thought</em> made me use <em>believed</em> instead. Avoidance of this sort of repetition is standard practice. It&#8217;s even important scientifically. The linguist David Stuart <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3506_mayacode.html">made a big advance in understanding ancient Mayan</a> when he realized that different symbols mean the same thing. The different symbols appeared in the same block of text, like my <em>thought</em> and <em>believed</em>.</p>
<p>My question is: Why? What&#8217;s the evolutionary reason? Maybe it&#8217;s part of a push toward novelty, so that nobody says, &#8220;Today I went to the store. Today I went to the store.&#8221;Â  Or maybe it&#8217;s a way of pushing us to make distinctions, invent new words, and learn new words. It pushes us to make distinctions because it pushed me away fromÂ  lazily writing &#8221; . . . thought . . . thought&#8221;.</p>
<p>One reason this interests me is <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">my interpretation of why we like repeated decorative elements</a>. Many sorts of decoration involved repeated elements &#8212; identical things or pictures placed side by side. I believe we like this sort of thing so that we will place similar things side by side. When we place them side by side it&#8217;s easy to notice small differences that would otherwise be hard to see. Noticing small differences makes us connoisseurs. Connoisseurs are important economically because they are willing to pay more for finely-made stuff. They support cutting-edge artisans.</p>
<p>The <em>invent-new-words</em> explanation strikes me as the most plausible. First we do what the Mayans did: invent new words that mean exactly the same thing as the old words, purely to avoid short-range repetition. As the words get older, their meanings drift independently and they start to mean slightly different things (such as <em>job</em> and <em>profession</em>). Thereby the language does a better job of keeping up with technical/economic progress, which keeps generating new things that need new names.</p>

				<small>Saturday, January 16th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I am moving to an unfurnished apartment in Beijing so I went furniture shopping at a huge &#8220;furnishings plaza&#8221; with hundreds of furniture showrooms. (Not to mention showrooms for mattresses, doors, stairs, security systems, curtains, light fixtures, and interior decorators.) It was more like a trade show than anything I&#8217;ve seen in America or Europe. I think it had more furniture choices than the whole Bay Area. I loved wandering around it, partly because it kept reminding me of <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">my theory of human evolution</a>:</p>
<p>1. The huge choice included a big range of styles, includingÂ  European, Chinese Traditional, modern, and &#8220;flat-plate&#8221; (meaning flat pieces of wood). At least 90% of the stuff struck me as ugly. Garish, too ornate, too simple, clunky, chunky, bad colors, bad patterns, and so on. Of course there were buyers for all of it. That there is such diversity of taste (&#8220;no accounting for taste&#8221;) supports a diversity of technological development. Exactly what a healthy economy needs.</p>
<p>2. Almost all the furniture was decorated. (If you don&#8217;t want decoration, you shop at Ikea.) Decoration is unnecessary from a functional point of view &#8212; you can sleep on a bed whether it is decorated or not &#8212; but is obviously pleasant. (Which is why I wasn&#8217;t at Ikea.) Decoration is difficult, so the demand for it supports technological innovation.</p>
<p>3. I write a lot sitting up in bed. After I saw a bed with a cushioned headboard, I realized I wanted a bed with a built-in cushion for sitting up. I found something better than I knew existed &#8212; the headboard cushion is detachable and cleanable. Having chosen the bed, there was pressure to buy matching furniture &#8212; the side table, the wardrobe, and so on. The furniture that matched my chosen bed was not especially attractive by itself but would become more attractive when near my bed. Because we like seeing things match. Our preference for matching stuff at first glance is paradoxical since it seems to push for less diversity rather than more. Why do we like seeing things match? The evolutionary reason, I believe, is so we will put similar things side by side to get that effect. Notice how clothing stores and many other stores are decorated. Why is that good? Because when we put things side by side it is much easier to see little differences and thus little ways one of them can be improved. When you start to notice these little differences, you become a connoisseur. Connoisseurs pay more for hard-to-make stuff than the rest of us and thus support technology that produces hard-to-see improvements.</p>
<p>4. Few Chinese bedrooms have closets. Clothes are hung in wardrobes. The wardrobe that matched my chosen bed wasn&#8217;t the loveliest wardrobe I saw. But the loveliest wardrobe I saw didn&#8217;t match the bed I wanted. The loveliest wardrobe I saw had something unusual: decoration of several sizes. We like a combination of large-, medium-, and small-scale decorative detail more than one size alone. This creates further challenges for artisans: There is pressure to be skilled at a wide range of sizes. So you don&#8217;t just develop technology for making small decorative details, you also develop technology for making larger details. Again, human nature promoting diversity of technological development.</p>
<p>5. The more expensive stuff looked better than the cheaper stuff, yes. But a lot of the expensive stuff wasn&#8217;t so much beautiful as expensive-looking. You might or might not like it &#8212; but no one would disagree it was expensive. Presumably people buy such stuff to show off, the way we do so many things to show our status. That we use difficult-to-make possessions to display status (thus creating demand for such things) is yet another way that human nature promotes technological innovation.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, July 14th, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Forty or fifty years ago, psychologists and other scientists talked about &#8220;genes&#8221; determining this or that. (<a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article3039959.ece">James Watson</a> still talks this way.) A certain percentage of the variation of this or that (e.g., intelligence) was attributed to &#8220;genes&#8221;. Hardly anyone outside genetics or behavior genetics knew what this meant, but many people thought they did. In reaction to the huge misunderstanding (e.g., those who said intelligence was &#8220;80% genetic&#8221; but did not know what this meant), psychologists began to talk about gene-environment interaction. &#8220;Is the area of a rectangle determined by its height or its width?&#8221; they like to say.</p>
<p>But notice how fact-free this view is. A tiny number of studies have observed gene-environment interactions but they are very difficult. I think this has made it hard to realize something basic and important. Years ago, I heard a talk about squirrel circadian rhythms by Patricia DeCoursey, the scientist who introduced the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_response_curve">phase-response curves</a>. At her talk, she showed results from about 15 squirrels. She tested each one &#8212; with an emphasis on individual results that resembles  self-experimentation &#8212; to determine how much light it needed to become entrained to a 24-hour light/dark cycle. One squirrel needed much stronger light than the others.</p>
<p>Here was an interesting finding that another scientist might have missed. What did it mean? Because the squirrels lived under very similar conditions (e.g., identical diets), it was almost surely a genetic difference. Let&#8217;s assume it was. In nature, sunlight is plenty strong. The lab light was weaker. In nature, the genetic difference wouldn&#8217;t make an observable difference. Only under artificial conditions did it become visible. It only became visible when the artificial conditions didn&#8217;t supply enough of something important (sunlight). In other words, the newly-visible genetic difference implied there was something lacking in the artificial conditions. <strong>The genetic difference implied the environment mattered</strong>. The opposite of the usual interpretation.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know any reason to think this is an unusual case. Aaron Blaisdell told me a story that shows its relevance to human health. Aaron is unusually sensitive to sunlight. Until recently, he could only spend 5 or 10 minutes in the sun before it became unpleasant. The condition is genetic. His mother has it; her father had it. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietic_protoporphyria">Erythropoietic Protoporphyria</a>. It is autosomal-dominant. Scientists even know where the gene is. That&#8217;s where the understanding of most scientists stops. A genetic condition. Recently, however, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/02/08/aaron-blaisdell-recommends/">Aaron drastically changed his diet with great results, as noted earlier</a>. At the same time as the dietary changes, <strong>his sun sensitivity got much better</strong>. He can now stay in the sun for an hour or more without discomfort. This is a gene-environment interaction, of course, but of a particular sort: <strong>The genetic effect showed there was something wrong with the environment</strong>, just as it did in DeCoursey&#8217;s experiment.</p>
<p>Sure, there&#8217;s always genetic variation &#8212; it&#8217;s just usually hard to see. The wrong environment makes it much easier to see. It reveals a range of genotypes, all of which would be harmless in the right environment. So when you come across a &#8220;genetic disorder&#8221; such as Erythropoetic Protoporphyria, it is likely to imply an environmental problem. No one had ever told Aaron or his mother or her father that their condition suggested that environmental changes would help them.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m sure that what we want to eat is a good guide to what we should eat, so long as you ask what our preferences would have led us to eat 100,000 years ago &#8212; before we killed off the woolly mammoths. (Curiously, I&#8217;ve never seen this obvious idea in any nutrition text.) A vast amount of trial and error is embodied in those preferences. Because we learn to like foods, our best guide to unlearned preferences may be what children want to eat.</p>
<p>The great essayist <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1980/11/17/1980_11_17_063_TNY_CARDS_000329878">George Trow</a> doesn&#8217;t quite get it, I&#8217;m afraid:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the New History, the preferences of a child carried as much weight as the preferences of an adult, so the refining of preferences was subtracted from what it was necessary for a man to learn to do.</p></blockquote>

					<p><a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/05/not_death_of_newspapers_but_de.php">James Fallows</a> wonders if the decline of newspapers is one effect of a much larger trend: the decline of advertising. He quotes a reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real problem is, advertising is dying. It&#8217;s just pulling down newspapers along the way. Next up: TV, radio, and Google.</p></blockquote>
<p>Advertising isn&#8217;t cost-effective, the reader says. This is becoming increasingly clear. Companies can no longer justify the expense.</p>
<p>I would bet a lot of money this is wrong. Advertising isn&#8217;t dying; it is moving to a more differentiated personalized form, as has happened in dozens of industries. Jane Jacobs wrote about this in <em>The Economy of Cities</em>: the historical flow is from artisanal production to mass production to differentiated production. An example is software. Long ago, programs were written by individuals: artisanal production. Then came software produced by large companies, such as Microsoft: mass production. Now we are entering the age of highly individualized software. The usual term is <strong>open source</strong> but open source software is enormously customizable. For example, some Tsinghua students made a version of Firefox specifically for Tsinghua students. Internet Explorer will never be as easily customized as Firefox. Which means, according to history, IE is doomed.</p>
<p>Fallows&#8217;s reader is wrong for another reason: The central role of advertising in human evolution. Language was the first advertising. Single words served to say (a) you had something to trade and (b) you wanted something. This is how and why language began &#8212; it facilitated trade. Language was so successful as advertising that lots of other uses evolved on top of that use, just as newspapers and magazines do a lot besides carry advertisements. Human evolution, in my view, is the story of how we became occupational specialists; by increasing trade, advertising was central to that. In the form of language, it&#8217;s been a huge force pushing evolution for the last 100,000-odd years. Given that longevity, the probability it will disappear in the next 100 years is very low.</p>
<p>The language evolution theory makes a prediction. Words can easily be used (a) to announce you have something (&#8220;toothpaste!&#8221;) and (b) to ask for something (&#8220;toothpaste?&#8221;). The first is <a href="http://tools.devshed.com/c/a/Website-Advertising/Push-vs-Pull-Advertising/"><strong>push advertising</strong></a>; the second is <strong>pull advertising</strong>. We don&#8217;t hear much about pull advertising. But the current imbalance &#8212; huge amounts spent on one, almost nothing on the other &#8212; doesn&#8217;t make sense. Historically, both work. We use language both ways, including a lot of pull advertising. Surely most people say what they want (&#8220;I&#8217;m hungry&#8221;) more often than they say what they have to trade for it. (In China, some peddlers, such as <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/12/19/my-theory-of-human-evolution-fixing-bike-pumps/">the father of a friend of mine</a>, do spend their day saying what they are selling.)</p>
<p>Based on history, I predict the imbalance will be corrected; pull advertising will become much more important. Not a brilliant prediction because it is already happening. Searching online for something you want, e.g. via Google, is a form of pull advertising. Guru.com, where you post a job you want done and wait for bids, is another example. An example that doesn&#8217;t yet exist is a free concierge-by-phone service. You call them, they help you buy something.</p>

					<p>According to <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">my theory of human evolution</a>, art evolved as a way to advance material science. Because we enjoy art we paid for it, which helped artists develop better control of materials.</p>
<p>According to Dorothy Hosler, author of <em><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=7594&#038;ttype=2">The Sounds and Colors of Power: The Sacred Metallurgical Technology of Ancient West Mexico</a></em>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Metallic sounding instruments, especially bells, were used in rituals that offered protection in war, that celebrated creation, fertility, and regeneration, and that figured in concepts of the sacredâ€”rituals, in short, that created a universe through song, through the sound of bells, and through reflective golden and silvery colors.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="bodycopy">In Mexico, she is saying, advanced metallurgy was first used to make bells. So here is an example. Rituals, too, I argue, evolved because they provided a desire for &#8220;nice&#8221; stuff &#8212; the fine printing of Christmas cards, the fine clothes of priests &#8212; which helped state-of-the-art artisans improve.</span></p>
<p>Here was a way to support science/technology that worked. Whereas the current system gives us <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/04/16/brainwashing-in-high-places-genetics-and-disease/">delusional ideas about genes</a>.</p>

					<p>A year ago, in a Berkeley Starbucks, I met a linguistics professor in town for a conference. I asked him how he thought language began. He dismissed the question: We will never know, he said. Speculations on the question are pseudo-science. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_Nichols">Johanna Nichols</a> and I taught a graduate seminar about the evolution of language and I will admit that none of the papers we read were impressive.</p>
<p>All were by linguists and all looked at language and nothing else. If you look more widely at how humans differ from our closest ancestors the question of how language evolved becomes easier. It&#8217;s one of many changes that pulled in the same direction: the rise of occupational specialization and trading. Language began because it made trading much easier. Language &#8212; single words &#8212; made it much easier for the two sides of a trade to find each other.</p>
<p>Single words are still used this way. In any business district, you will see single words on signs that advertise what a business has for sale (e.g., &#8220;doughnuts&#8221;). Long ago, of course, there were no signs: People just said words in the hope of finding someone who wanted what they had or had what they wanted.</p>
<p>This theory implies that <strong>possession</strong> (who has what?) was the very first topic of conversation. This theory is supported by the fact that the verb <em>to have</em> plays a remarkably central role in English: <em>I have written</em>, <em>I had a good time</em>, <em>I had had a fair amount, I have to reach. </em>You might think <em>to be</em> would be more important, but it isn&#8217;t. This pattern suggests that <em>to have </em>was one of the very first verbs, maybe the first.</p>
<p>Chinese has no tense markers (I go yesterday, I go today, I go tomorrow) but again possession appears to have been present close to the beginning of the language. Here is how you negate a verb in Chinese:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>to have </em>and other &#8220;state&#8221; verbs<em>:</em> with <em>mei</em></p>
<p>all other verbs: with <em>bu</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7163/abs/nature06137.html">The more irregular a verb, the older it is likely to be</a>. (Thanks to Navanit Arakeri for the link.)</p>

					<p>I believe <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/27/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">language evolved</a> because it facilitated trade. If you wanted X, being able to say &#8220;X?&#8221; made it a thousand times easier to find someone with excess X. This efficiency required prior language learning, of course. Language learning happened in the background, so to speak, then paid off in the foreground by making one of human life&#8217;s biggest tasks (trading) much easier.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/wireless/magazine/17-03/mf_netbooks?currentPage=all">this excellent article</a> about netbooks, I realized they&#8217;re like language. All sorts of tasks become much easier for your computer if the heavy lifting is done by a server. You no longer need Word or Photoshop, for example. Just as using language to trade required prior language learning, using netbooks this way requires prior software development.</p>
