					<p>As recently as four or five years ago,and for many years before that, I often had a runny nose. I went through boxes and boxes of Kleenex. I carried a handkerchief everywhere and often used it. Not because I had a cold&#8211;I almost never got colds. It was different than that. You might say I was mildly allergic to something in the air. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/20/more-fermented-foods-less-runny-nose/#more-7887" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>Julie O’Brien and Richard Climenhage <a href="http://www.ballardnewstribune.com/2012/10/09/features/firefly-kitchens-bringing-health-through-ferm">run a small company</a> in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle called Firefly Kitchens, devoted to making fermented foods. The company was founded in 2010.</p>
<blockquote><p>Climenhage, a former high-tech executive, became intrigued with fermented foods about 10 years ago after a nutritionist suggested he consume more fats and fermented food. It cured the chronic heart palpitations that he had endured for two years.</p>
<p>“Six weeks and two days after changing my eating the palpitations were gone, never to return,” Climenhage said. “So I was sold. I started making my own sauerkraut and never looked back.”</p></blockquote>

					<blockquote><p>This low-calorie soda (60 to 80 calories in a 12-ounce can) falls somewhere between kombucha and less-sweet sodas such as the aptly named GUS (Grown Up Soda). Its hook is the use of fermented juices as its base, resulting in a more complex flavor than sodas and sparkling waters based on plain juice.</p></blockquote>

<p>My interest in fermented foods partly derives from learning about a similar product. At a Fancy Food Show a few years ago, I learned about someone who wanted to develop a high-end non-alcoholic alternative to wine. He found he couldn&#8217;t get enough complexity without fermentation. That emphasized to me how our food preferences &#8212; in this case, a desire for complexity &#8212; push us to eat fermented foods.</p>

					<p>One of the main reasons I think we need to eat fermented foods to be healthy is that their flavors correspond neatly to the flavors we like. Fermentation of fruits and other sweet foods changes sugars to acids, making the food taste sour &#8212; and we like sour food. Fermentation of proteins produces glutamate, which produces an umami flavor &#8212; and we like umami-flavored food. With many foods, their fermentation produces many microbial byproducts, giving the food a complex flavor &#8212; and we like complex flavors.</p>
<p>The connection between fermentation and complex flavor is well-put in <a href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Techniques/Preserving-Plenty">a <em>Saveur</em> article</a> about fermented foods:</p>
<blockquote><p>[As a child] I only knew Claussen and other vinegar-cured pickles, the kind you buy in jars off the supermarket shelf, and I liked them just fine. But when I finally tasted a real pickle—the kind made the old-fashioned way, fermented with nothing more than salt, water, and time—I realized what I had been missing. A vinegary pickle plows through your palate with its tartness (often in a most pleasing way), but a live-cultured, salt-cured, fermented one tells a more multifaceted story. It is sour, to be sure, but it tastes of something more, something elusive: It&#8217;s the flavor of Middle Europe captured in one bite. When I started cooking for a living, I realized that the complexity I&#8217;d tasted in that pickle is the hallmark of well-made fermented foods, which include some of my very favorite things to eat and drink: not just pickles, but aged cheeses, tangy sourdough breads, blistering kimchis, tart yogurts, winy salamis, and of course, wine itself.</p></blockquote>

				<small>Saturday, July 28th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/96/2/382.abstract">A new epidemiological study</a> followed about 16,000 people in Europe for about 12 years and focused on their dairy intake. Did the ones who came down with diabetes eat differently from those who didn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>The paper begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>Current dietary guidelines for prevention of diabetes aim at substituting SFAs [saturated fatty acids] with unsaturated fatty acids. However, conventionally held notions that all SFAs, including those from dairy products, are detrimental to health have recently been challenged.</p></blockquote>
<p>The shift of evidence (dairy less bad than previously believed) supports my view that what&#8217;s good for the brain (I found butter was good for my brain) is likely to be good for the rest of the body. The paper&#8217;s main conclusion is the possible protective value of cheese and yogurt:</p>
<blockquote><p>This large prospective study found no association between total dairy product intake and diabetes risk. An inverse association of cheese intake and combined fermented dairy product [= cheese, yogurt, and "thick fermented milk"] intake with diabetes is suggested.</p></blockquote>
<p>The combined fermented dairy association was not large in size (a risk reduction of 12%) but was significant (barely). When your main finding is barely significant you have no hope of using your data to explain it so the new information essentially stops there. The results support my view that fermented foods are unusually healthy.</p>
<p>In response to these findings, the director of research at Diabetes UK <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9422230/Cheese-could-reduce-diabetes-risk.html">said</a>, “This study gives us no reason to believe that people should change their dairy intake in an attempt to avoid [diabetes].” Wow. It is as if a prominent physicist said the earth was flat.</p>

					<p>You make kombucha by brewing tea, adding sugar, and adding a starter of some sort. Usually the starter is part of the &#8220;mother&#8221; (SCOBY) from a previous batch of kombucha but I have just found that adding a little bit of store-bought kombucha also works. I added two tablespoons of GT&#8217;s kombucha and two tablespoons of Revive kombucha to sugared tea. Two weeks later there was a perfectly good mother on top of the tea. This is useful to know even if you have a mother if you want to make kombucha slowly. In <em>The Art of Fermentation</em>, Sandor Katz advocates adding a bottle of kombucha into your sugared tea if you don&#8217;t have a mother.</p>

				<small>Monday, July 16th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I recently came across two different people who, diagnosed with Crohn&#8217;s disease, repeated <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/crohns-disease/DS00104/">the standard line</a> that it &#8220;has no known cure&#8221;. Really? Never? The people who said this were just repeating what they had been told. Unlike twenty or thirty years ago, however, it is easy to do one&#8217;s own research. The people who said this gave no indication they had done any research. Because Crohn&#8217;s is so unpleasant, their passivity was curious.</p>
<p>I knew that calling Crohn&#8217;s disease &#8220;incurable&#8221; was an overstatement because <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/10/seth-roberts-grandmother-knows-best-about-crohns-disease.html">I had written about Reid Kimball</a>, who had found a way to eliminate via diet essentially all the symptoms. For practical purposes, he was cured.  (Reid objects to the word &#8220;cure&#8221;.) I knew he was hardly the only one. But what if I started from ignorance? How hard would it be to challenge the conventional &#8220;incurable&#8221; line?</p>
<p>Not hard at all. I googled &#8220;Crohn&#8217;s success&#8221; (without quotation marks in the search query). <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzetb4n6/crohnsdiseasesuccesswithdietandprobiotics/">The top search result</a> (titled &#8220;Crohn&#8217;s Disease: Success with Diet and Probiotics&#8221;) included this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I learned of a pediatric gastroenterologist, Dr. J. Rainer Poley, who had conducted extensive studies on the effect of certain sugars and starches on people with intestinal diseases. My husband and I decided to take our daughter to see this doctor for another opinion. When we asked him if there was any other treatment she could try besides medications, he explained that at a recent medical conference in Europe, he had learned of success medical doctors were having with probiotics. He instructed our daughter to eat plain yogurt every day and to take a specific probiotic capsule called Culturelle® containing Lactobacillus GG [Gorbach and Goldin] twice daily. Based on Dr. Poley&#8217;s research, he wanted her to limit the consumption of concentrated sugars (specifically table sugar, technically known as sucrose). The intent of the sucrose-restricted diet was to starve the harmful bacteria by taking away their major food source. The yogurt and Lactobacillus GG would help replenish the &#8220;good&#8221; bacteria. Since it has been well documented that an overgrowth of bacteria is prevalently seen in people with Crohn’s disease, this treatment sounded like a plausible solution.</p>
<p>Our daughter, feeling drained from the effects of Crohn’s disease, felt motivated to try the doctor’s recommendations. . . . After about two weeks, she began to feel better in general. At the follow-up doctor&#8217;s appointment three months later, she had gained six pounds and her lab work was ALL NORMAL! . . . She continues to remain well [over 7 years later] with normal lab work and without clinical symptoms.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked Ms. Kalichman how others had fared with this treatment. She replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Periodically, I hear from others who have tried the treatment that my daughter does, and it seems that many have been helped a lot. Unfortunately they don&#8217;t always continue to keep in touch, so I don&#8217;t have any idea how many are totally well. Our daughter continues to be well as she has been for almost 9 years now&#8230;no meds and no clinical symptoms.</p></blockquote>
<p>That took about 5 minutes, including emailing Kalichman. She referred me to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/marthakalichman">a video about it</a>.</p>

					<p>In Tokyo I went to a shop that specialized in miso. It sold about thirty varieties, several of which I liked very much. There is a choice of packaging: hard or soft. The hard packages could be used for gifts. The phone number of the shop is 03(3841)7116, which you can use to google it. It is in the Hanakawado district, between Kototoi Dori and Edo Dori, near the Senso-ji Temple and the Amuse Museum. It is open 9 am to 6 pm. Maybe closed Sunday. </p>
<p>Address: 2 &#8211; 8 2-chome, Taito-ku, Tokyo Hanakawado 〒 111-0033, which 0.23 km from the Asakusa Station.</p>
<p>Incidentally, nowadays I tend to eat miso with a poached egg. Boil 0.8 cup water, add egg, cook until poached, add the miso which has been mixed with 0.1 cup water.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A few weeks ago I posted <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/06/17/assorted-links-184/">a short note about Yakult</a>, a probiotic dairy drink popular in Asia. Yesterday, I came across <a href="http://www.koanicsoul.com/blog/2012/06/27/how-to-manifest-whatever-you-want/"> someone who had read that note</a>. He wrote about it in a post categorized as Learning Koanic Soul.</p>
<blockquote><p>To test whether I did indeed now possess Melonhead powers, I attempted to manifest the thing I wanted most, and had been striving to attain the longest: <strong>a cure for the adverse side effects of the Accutane</strong> I’d taken 8 years ago.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief list of the side effects I suffered:</p>
<ul>
<li>chronic diarrhea</li>
<li>chronic fatigue</li>
<li>inability to eat almost every food, including pills</li>
<li>insomnia</li>
<li>additional symptoms, increasing exponentially when I eat forbidden foods or miss sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the last 8 years I’d painstakingly developed a coping regimen that worked in theory, as long as I did it perfectly. But it was so strict that holding down a job or traveling were almost impractical. And any error meant days if not weeks of down time. I rarely achieved better than than 50% functionality. And my diet was so limited that I ate only one meal continuously – lean steamed meat with rice, scallops and shrimp.</p>
<p>All attempts at a cure had failed, and not only failed, but proven that I couldn’t even digest the pills that might make me better. Instead, the difficulty of digesting the pills induced a failure cascade, a reinforcing feedback loop of insomnia, stress, fatigue and diarrhea. After years of fighting this illness, I had learned a great deal but was running out of things to try.</p>
<p>So, for my first manifestation attempt, I decided to demand an INSTANT cure.</p>
<p>Not a regimen for coping with symptoms… Actual, immediate, damage reversal. . . .The experiment began as I wrapped up a Skype conversation with a Melonhead. He’d just finished describing his “powers” to me. I got the idea for the experiment, and told him what I’d try to manifest. Immediately I experienced a boost in energy – I’d been feeling sick. I was shocked – it appeared to be already working.</p>
<p>I finished talking to the Melonhead, and flicked open my RSS reader while deciding what to do next. Up popped an article by Seth Roberts mentioning the GI healing properties of Yakult, a fermented yoghurt drink common in Asia. Accompanied with link to scientific paper and news report.</p>
<p>This startled me, because I’d been planning to try fermenting my own yoghurt next, although I had low expectations for success. I was planning on getting a yoghurt making machine, yada yada. I began reading with interest. Could this be the sign I’d requested?</p>
<p>As I finished reading, my girlfriend arrived home. I told her I wanted to buy some of this “Yakult” stuff tomorrow, figuring the grocery stores were closed tonight. She replied that she had some in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>This got my attention. I’d requested an instant cure… and the cure, if it was one, had been sitting IN MY REFRIGERATOR before I requested it.</p>
<p>The main problem was the massive sugar content of Yakult. I knew that I had sugar malabsorption issues – I can’t eat fruit. There was an excellent chance that if I tried the Yakult, I would become sick for at least 3 days, and endure excruciating pain. For the record, torture by several consecutive days of gut cramps is one of the few things I am afraid of, being a subset of torture in general. Nevertheless, I elected to drink two (disgustingly sweet) Yakult bottles that night.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of days I continued to ramp up my Yakult dosage. My body rebelled some at the radical change, but it also showed signs of improvement. The expected disaster failed to materialize.</p>
<p>Day two was the worst. I felt as if I might be becoming genuinely sick. Given the amount I’d drunk, this meant a solid three days of agony were kicking off. That night I endured some physical pain, but I was also strangely energized, so that I had the mental reserves to face it out. Normally the illness saps all capacity for resistance.</p>
<p>That night I received a “message” (or had a thought, whichever you prefer) that “it would take three days.” Sure enough, on day 3 I knew was better, significantly so, instead of worse. There could be no further doubt that it was working. For me, something had finally changed.</p>
<p>Note that I would expect a full gut healing to take place over 3-6 months. It’s not simply a matter of fixing diet or finding the right pill, but 1. rebuilding bacterial colonies and 2. regrowing and healing intestinal lining damaged or eaten away by inflammation and acidity. While these results are not instant, they are screamingly fast in GI terms.</p>
<p>Impressed by this initial success, over the next few days I began to let manifestation guide my behavior intuitively, rather than using logic to determine my actions. An image of a key supplement appeared in my head – I went and bought it at the precise store I remembered seeing it. When I arrived I discovered it was on sale: 2 for 1.</p>
<p>At the grocery store, I simply wandered, letting manifestation dictate my purchases. I grew disgusted with the excessive sweetness of Yakult: lo and behold, I found a bulk yoghurt with a lower sugar content. I tested a few key supplements I had lying around, and found I could now digest pills. So I started taking everything I’d stored up but been unable to use. This resulted in a major improvement. At the same time, I gradually began eating a more diverse collection of foods, letting intuition guide me. No disaster ensued.</p>
<p>Once it was clear that I was cured, I wanted to know my new limits. And I didn’t intend to wait 6 months to find out. Among other things, I’ve tested a half block of cheese (lactose and fat intolerance), modest amounts of fruit (fructose and insoluble fiber intolerance), and the finisher, a greasy-spoon restaurant meal.</p>
<p>None of these could induce a return of the diarrhea that has plagued me for the last 8 years. However, the first and third did make me tired and give me gas for a couple of days. So I’m not invincible. The former was probably a matter of trying too much fat too soon (I have liver damage impairing fat digestion), and the latter was simply unfit for human consumption.</p>
<p>All this took about two weeks to transpire, from June 15 to June 28 [2012], and brings us to the present. I am eating a varied and delicious diet, and enjoying good energy and good health. My 8 year torment is at an end.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: His girlfriend is Asian, he isn&#8217;t. More seriously, it really does show the power of fermented foods, in this case Yakult and yogurt. </p>

				<small>Saturday, June 23rd, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>The Art of Fermentation</em> by Sandor Katz was published two weeks and I got a copy from the publisher. It has a few conceptual chapters (&#8220;fermentation as a coevolutionary force&#8221;, health benefits, small business)  but most of it is DIY, how to ferment X, Y, and Z. Unlike a set of recipes, he includes background with each food so the result is a cross between an encyclopedia and a cookbook. There are also several pages of color photographs, cute marginal drawings, and excellent lists of references and sources. It covers lots of stuff I rarely see. For example, there is one page on fermenting eggs. When I&#8217;m in China, I eat lots of fermented eggs. The book doesn&#8217;t mention the controversy in China about heavy metals in the fermented eggs.</p>
<p>The author&#8217;s enthusiasm is contagious and I&#8217;m sure the book will encourage me to ferment more stuff. Nowadays I just make yogurt, kefir, and kombucha &#8212; not even sauerkraut. I once got a book called something like <em>The Book of Yogurt</em> that consisted of 30 different yogurt recipes &#8212; which differed from each other by only about 5%. Page after page the same with only minor differences. Talk about <a href="nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/06/jonah-lehrer-plagiarism-new-yorker-examples-pile-up.html">cut and paste</a>! I got rid of it (&#8220;this is useless!&#8221;) but now I wish I had saved it because it was so funny.</p>
<p>Which is only to say that food writing is either incredibly difficult or incredibly awful. I used to subscribe to <em>Saveur</em>. Some of their recipes were very good. The writing was awful, however &#8212; like something from a tourist guide. Please, don&#8217;t tell me how beautiful the country, how friendly the cook, or how tasty the food! Katz does better than that, especially when he is describing what he has actually done. But about half of the book reminds me of my first piece of extended writing &#8212; a &#8220;state report&#8221; about Maine that I did when I was in fifth grade. I went to several encyclopedias and copied the interesting stuff. Katz has gone to quite a few books and copied the interesting stuff.</p>
<p>In at least one case, he has copied too much. I have made yogurt hundreds of times. Only in the beginning did I do something like what practically everyone in America, including Katz, advocates: heat the milk up, let it cool, put in the culture. Now I just take the milk from the refrigerator, put in a tiny amount of culture, surround the milk with hot water (using a Chinese yogurt-making machine that keeps the water warm), and wait. So much easier. The final product is better (smoother, thicker) than the old hard way, especially when I learned that tiny amounts of culture work better than large amounts. &#8220;In my experience, cultures from commercial yogurts never maintain their viability beyond a few generations,&#8221; Katz writes. My experience is different: I&#8217;ve never had a problem using them.</p>
<p>In contrast to Harold McGee&#8217;s <em>On Food and Cooking</em>, <em>The Art of Fermentation</em> is more personal, more hands-on, and less scientific, all of which are improvements, in my opinion. It is also more opinionated, which since the opinions are commonplace, is bad. &#8220;I too love the beer they are usually thinking of . . . However I define <em>beer</em> more broadly than the famous 1516 Bavarian beer purity law . . . I define <em>beer</em> as a fermented alcoholic beverage in which . . . &#8221; At another point, to my surprise, he mentions Jane Jacobs and her theory that agriculture began in cities. &#8220;If Jacobs&#8217;s theory is correct, then fermentation practices must also have had urban roots,&#8221; writes Katz. This is not interesting. The small business chapter is interesting whenever Katz is telling the story of a small business and uninteresting the rest of the time (&#8220;Consistency is not necessarily important to the home experimentalist&#8221;).</p>
<p>Oh well. I am glad to have a book that will encourage me to ferment more stuff and from which I can learn a lot about fermentation. The book is obviously a labor of love and there are not many of those.</p>

				<small>Thursday, June 21st, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/science/studies-of-human-microbiome-yield-new-insights.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;smid=pl-share&amp;pagewanted=all">A new article in the <em>New York Times</em></a> by Carl Zimmer is about the importance of the bacteria inside of us. Several studies are described. Then it comes to the practical use of the knowledge. Here&#8217;s what we can do to improve our inner bacterial ecology:</p>
<blockquote><p>To ward off dangerous skin pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, for instance, Dr. Segre envisions applying a cream infused with nutrients [Treatment 1] for harmless skin bacteria to feed on.<strong> . . . </strong>Adding the bacteria directly may also help. Unfortunately, the science of so-called probiotics [Treatment 2] lags far behind their growth in sales. In 2011, people bought $28 billion of probiotic foods and supplements. . . A growing number of doctors are treating C. difficile with fecal transplants [Treatment 3]: Stool from a healthy donor is delivered like a suppository to an infected patient. The idea is that the good bacteria in the stool establish themselves in the gut and begin to compete with C. difficile. This year, researchers at the University of Alberta <a title="Abstract of the paper." href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2012.05033.x/abstract">reviewed 124 fecal transplants</a> and concluded that the procedure is safe and effective.</p></blockquote>
<p>No mention of fermented foods. The obvious difference between fermented foods and Treatments 1-3, besides pleasure (fermented foods more pleasurable), is that Treatments 1-3 can be sold for high prices. Fermented foods cannot. (Except wine.)  The omission is curious. Just because the people that Zimmer interviews have tunnel vision doesn&#8217;t mean that Zimmer must.</p>
