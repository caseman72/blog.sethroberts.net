				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a graduate student, I had acne. Via self-experiment, I discovered that the antibiotic my dermatologist had prescribed didn&#8217;t work. He appeared unaware of this possibility, although antibiotics were (and are) very commonly prescribed for acne. &#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221; he said when I told him my results. As I&#8217;ve said before, I was stunned that in a few months I could figure out something important that he, the expert, didn&#8217;t know. He had years of training, practice, and so on. I had no experience at all. Eventually I gathered <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">additional and more impressive examples</a> &#8212; cases where I, an outsider with no medical training, managed to make a big contribution with tiny resources. The underlying message seemed to be that professional medicine rested on weak foundations, in the sense that big conclusions could be overturned with little effort.</p>
<p>Two recent posts  (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/02/12/journal-of-personal-science-l-planturum-rich-fermented-foods-and-supplement-preventedcured-my-eczema/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?p=13068">here</a>) on this blog argue that eczema, which afflicts about 10% of Americans, can be cured and prevented with fermented foods. This observation makes perfect sense because of two pre-existing ideas: 1. Eczema is due to an overactive immune system. 2. Fermented foods &#8220;cool down&#8221; that system (a variant of the hygiene hypothesis). Professors of dermatology failed to put them together, but people outside medicine were able to.</p>
<p>After I learned that eczema could be cured easily and safely, statements by medical professionals about eczema became horrifying. A dermatologist <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1ya4nw/new_sufferer_advice_please/">recently wrote about eczema on Reddit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eczema is a chronic condition, which includes hand eczema. It&#8217;s a condition of dry and sensitive skin. Topical steroids are a useful adjunct in getting your skin clear, and &#8211; in certain cases &#8211; keeping your skin clear. I tell my patients that the most important thing in management of eczema is the skin care regimen. This means avoidance of irritating factors and restoration of the skin barrier.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://nationaleczema.org/eczema/causes-and-triggers-of-eczema/">National Eczema Association</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The exact causes of eczema are unknown. You might have inherited a tendency for eczema.. . . Many doctors think eczema causes are linked to allergic disease, such as hay fever or asthma. Doctors call this the atopic triad. Many children with eczema (up to 80%) will develop hay fever and/or asthma.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eczema/basics/definition/con-20032073">Mayo Clinic website</a>: &#8220;The cause of atopic dermatitis is unknown, but it may result from a combination of inherited tendencies for sensitive skin and malfunction in the body&#8217;s immune system.&#8221;  The various remedies listed have nothing to do with the immune system.</p>
<p>What else don&#8217;t they know? Doctors have great power over our well-being. Imagine learning that the driver of the car you are in is nearly blind.</p>

<blockquote><p>My eczema and other skin problems of 15 years disappeared completely from regular kefir and yogurt, which I did because of this blog.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked for details.<span id="more-13066"></span></p>
<p><i>Who are you?</i></p>
<p>I live in Mesa Arizona, 49 years old, software developer.</p>
<p><i>When did it start?</i></p>
<p>I had lots of allergy problems as a child; had to have soy milk as a baby, had allergy shots for 5 years until I was 22 or so, I was allergic to trees and grass. The allergies pretty much went away after I came to Arizona and now have had no problems at all with it for many years.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure my eczema started in Maryland before I moved to AZ, that would put it before 1992. It started on the outside of my right shin. I can&#8217;t recall and never had any notion of any change that brought it on. It continued up until I started the kefir, though it would go dormant from time to time, often after which it would reappear elsewhere. It progressed from my shin to the back of my right knee, my right inner thigh, then my back, then my hands. It was always most prominent on my right side; I am right-handed.</p>
<p><i>Before fermented foods, what did you do to get rid of it?</i></p>
<p>I tried vitamin E both orally and topically very early. It did seem to soothe it but I hated the smell and mess. Otherwise I used cortisone when it was really bad, but tried to minimize that. Mostly I just put up with it.</p>
<p><i>What were the fermented foods?</i></p>
<p>I liked Nancy&#8217;s Peach best for kefir; it was the most sour, and the other flavors of that brand had berry seeds that I didn&#8217;t like. Otherwise I got Lifeway Pomegranate [kefir], second most sour. Yogurt was mostly Strauss Farms or Brown Cow, though occasionally I&#8217;ll get Fage if the others aren&#8217;t there. I would have probably 3 containers of kefir and one or two of yogurt a week. For the yogurt I would get unflavored and add some bananas or maybe a little honey.</p>
<p><i>After you started eating kefir and yogurt, how long until you noticed improvement?</i></p>
<p>Less than a week. I went on and off many times, both intentionally and inadvertently, and the pattern was repeated every time. Now I can go off of either one without it returning; I don&#8217;t think I have seen any eczema in more than a year even though I might go a week or two without it. I have slowed down in the kefir because most of them have sugars and stuff, I mostly go for the plain yogurt these days.</p>
<p><i>Did you expect the improvement?</i></p>
<p>Not at all. I was trying to recover from a bad stomach bug that left me with digestive distress. I only tried the kefir because I read it had more cultures than yogurt. It solved the digestive problems but I only noticed the effect on eczema when I stopped it and the eczema returned. I hadn&#8217;t noticed it had stopped since it sometimes went dormant for a few weeks at a time.</p>
<p><i>What were the other skin problems?</i></p>
<p>I had splitting of my fingertips, really painful and right on the tip making it hard to use. I assumed this was just the eczema presenting itself here, but it might have been something else. I also had generally dry itchy skin no matter how much lotion I used, which is not a problem now.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ve taking the probiotic for just this week (twice a day plus some kimchi when I can + I started eating Kimchi at the beginning of last week) and I’ve seen some dramatic improvements.

My Rosacea hasn’t changed at all. Sinuses seem better but I’m still holding off on weather this intervention is helping. <b>The most dramatic change has been in my lower respiratory area.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by <a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Shant Mesrobian</a></h4>
<p>At some point during the last decade, while living in Washington D. C., I began to suffer from hand eczema.  Painful red itchy inflamed dry skin covered most of my hands. It was usually triggered by cold dry weather in the fall and winter. It also flared up after a lot of cleaning — when my hands were exposed to a lot of water and soap, which dried them out. I was in my twenties when it began.<span id="more-12985"></span></p>
<p>Eczema, also called <i>atopic dermatitis</i>, is believed to be a too-extreme allergic reaction. It is common. About 10% of American adults suffer from it, according to two recent surveys (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17498413" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559989" target="_blank">here</a>). In my case, a certain level of dryness is required. I believe the dryness, which may reduce a protective coating, allows something in the environment, like dust or pollen, to trigger an allergic inflammatory response.</p>
<p>The first thing I did to solve the problem was see a dermatologist, who prescribed a steroid-based cream. The cream did reduce the inflammation. It was just something to apply when the inflammation appeared. It didn&#8217;t stop it from happening. As I learned more about eczema, I decided this was an absurd solution. Steroids have nothing to do with the cause of eczema. At best they treated the symptoms, and had bad side effects (is anything creepier than “skin thinning”?). </p>
<p>Then a funny thing happened. A few years ago, my eczema disappeared. I didn’t notice it had stopped until this fall (2013), when it came back. I had forgotten about it. As soon as the weather turned cold and dry, it hit hard. </p>
<p>Why had it disappeared and returned? My environment had not changed in any big way. Nor, when I first thought about it, could I think of any dietary changes in the past year or two. Then I realized I had made a dietary change – and recently. In September (2013), I had stopped eating a few fermented foods that I had steadily eaten for the past few years — sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha. I had drank kombucha only a few times a month but had eaten sauerkraut or kimchi almost daily (3-4 forkfuls/day, $0.50/day). I had started eating them in 2011, hoping they would improve my health. The last time I had had eczema was the winter before I began regularly eating them. </p>
<p>Had the fermented food prevented eczema? This was not far-fetched. The ideas that (a) bacteria in food can influence your immune system and that (b) bacterial exposure can “calm down” an over-reactive immune system are both well-accepted. Review articles are <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/130/2/403.long" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-387-74087-4_17" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/5/6/1869" target="_blank">here</a>. There is lots of supporting evidence. An early example is the evidence behind the hygiene hypothesis – children in “dirty” places had fewer allergies than children in cleaner places. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351/" target="_blank">This article</a> says “approximately 70% of the entire immune system” is in the gastrointestinal system.<br />
Fermented vegetables like sauerkraut and kimchi are dominated by the bacterial species Lactobacillus plantarum. If sauerkraut and kimchi had prevented eczema, it was probably due to L. plantarum. </p>
<p>After multiple flares over a few months, I tested this idea. I found a probiotic supplement (Jarrow Formulas Ideal Bowel Support) solely composed of L. plantarum. Then I waited for my eczema to flare up again. When it did (early January 2014), I began taking the supplement (one pill daily, $0.50/day). Within three days, the eczema had completely disappeared. In the past, three days after it started the eczema got worse. It usually lasted about two weeks from start to disappearance. I had never seen it disappear like this. Usually at this point (3 days after it started) hand washing would be painful and make it worse. Now I could hand wash with abandon. Even more amazing: I could walk around outside during a cold spell without gloves, and did not have any exacerbation or return of symptoms. Being able to do these things three days into a flare up had never happened before. </p>
<p>I kept taking the supplement (one pill/day). In the past, before the fermented foods, I had at least some inflammation on my hands through the entire fall and winter, with extreme periods and less extreme periods. Now (February 2014) I have zero inflammation. In the past, dryness on my hands immediately led to inflammation. In normal people, dry hands are dry hands. I never have just dry hands. Dryness is a trigger. I&#8217;m not used to seeing a dry hand without inflammation on it. For the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve had mildly dry hands without inflammation. I&#8217;ve become a normal person with dry hands. </p>
<p>Several studies – which I didn’t know about when I saw that the probiotic supplement helped &#8212; support the idea that L. plantarum can reduce eczema. Two studies (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338447" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22726349" target="_blank">here</a>) found that <i>L. plantarum</i> inhibited house-dust-mite-induced eczema in mice. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210038" target="_blank">Another study</a> found that <i>L. plantarum</i> inhibited allergic reaction and histamine-induced scratching (itching is a hallmark symptom of eczema) in mice. It concluded that <i>L. plantarum</i> “may improve allergic diseases, such as . . . atopic dermatitis”. In <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19120072" target="_blank">another mouse study</a>, <i>L. plantarum</i> was successfully used to reduce dust mite allergy. The most impressive evidence was from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24094544" target="_blank">a 2012 study</a> done with children in South Korea. All of them had eczema. Those given <i>L. plantarum</i> improved much more over 14 weeks than those given a placebo. </p>
<p>In contrast to my success, many studies have found no effect of probiotic supplements on eczema. <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-treatment-of-allergic-disease" target="_blank">One review</a> concluded “Initial meta-analyses suggest no benefit of probiotics [supplements] in the treatment of eczema or asthma.” Maybe they tested the wrong bacteria or used a too-small dose. I haven’t noticed any effect of yogurt (which contains different bacteria) on my eczema.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/l-plantarum-cured-my-eczema/" target="_blank">I posted about this in my blog</a>, several people tried something similar and reported what happened. Overall <a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/kimchi-sauerkraut-experimenters-a-distinct-pattern-emerges/" target="_blank">I would summarize their results as modest improvement</a>. The most positive result was this: “After 5 days of radish kimchi the eczema in that person [a family member] is very clearly receding and, in a few spots, is completely gone. From prior experience, it would not have done this on its own.” The least positive result was no change, which a few people noticed.</p>
<p>My interpretation is that kimchi and sauerkraut – that’s what everyone tried &#8212; have far less <i>L. plantarum</i> than the probiotic supplement I took. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.02030.x/abstract" target="_blank">This article</a> considered sauerkraut “probiotic” when the concentration of <i>L. plantarum</i> was “higher than 10^6 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of product”.<br />
<a href="http://shop.goldminenaturalfoods.com/GOLD-MINE-ORGANIC-RAW-SAUERKRAUT-16-OZ/productinfo/1901-1916/" target="_blank">This sauerkraut maker</a> says their sauerkraut has 8 x 10^6 CFU per gram. A serving of sauerkraut might be 60 g, so the total number of <i>L. plantarum</i> in one serving will be roughly 5 x 10^8. In contrast, the probiotic supplement I took supposedly contained 10^10 CFU – a factor of one hundred more.  A daily dose of 5 x 10^8 CFU might eliminate eczema if you eat it for months, as I did, but might produce much more modest results after just a week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been testing my brain function daily for the last six years. I use a reaction-time test (see digit, type digit as fast as possible) that takes about five minutes. I have gradually improved the test over the years &#8212; this is about version 8. One reason for this testing is that I might observe a sudden change. That could suggest a new factor that affects brain function &#8212; whatever was unusual before the change (e.g., a new food). This is how I discovered <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">the effect of butter</a>. My score suddenly improved, I investigated. Another sudden change (improvement) happened soon after I switched from Chinese flaxseed oil to American flaxseed oil. I hadn&#8217;t realized that something was wrong with the Chinese flaxseed oil. I started brain tracking after I noticed a sudden improvement in balance the morning after I swallowed about five flaxseed oil capsules. Millions of people had taken flaxseed oil capsules, but no one, it seemed, had noticed the balance improvement. <em>Maybe other big changes in brain function go unnoticed</em>, I thought.</p>
<p><span id="more-12281"></span></p>
<p>A month ago, my score suddenly got worse (= I became slower). There was one unusual thing that day, before the test: I had eaten a piece of <em>bai fu ru</em>, a kind of fermented tofu popular in China. <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/09/chichis-chinese-fermented-bean-curd.html" target="_blank">To make it</a>, &#8220;cubes of tofu are first fermented, then soaked in brines that contain a number of ingredients: rice wine, vinegar, chili peppers, cinnamon, star anise, and red yeast rice, the last which imparts the deep red hue that you&#8217;ll see in certain varieties.&#8221; <a href="http://www.kcet.org/living/food/the-nosh/have-you-eaten/4-ways-to-enjoy-stinky-tofu-in-los-angeles.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a discussion of fermented tofu in Los Angeles. It&#8217;s popular in China. Most people use it as a condiment, but I ate small amounts (one cube)  alone.</p>
<p>To find out if the <em>bai fu ru</em> caused the worsening, I did a test. I deliberately ate one 20 g cube at 11 am. I do the brain tests in the afternoon, usually 4-5 pm. What happen to my brain score that day? Here are the results.</p>
<p><a href="http://s919.photobucket.com/user/twoutopias/media/2013-12-01tofuslowsdownbraintofuplot_zpsceffdd58.jpeg.html" target="_blank"><img alt=" photo 2013-12-01tofuslowsdownbraintofuplot_zpsceffdd58.jpeg" src="http://i919.photobucket.com/albums/ad40/twoutopias/2013-12-01tofuslowsdownbraintofuplot_zpsceffdd58.jpeg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Each point is a different test. I conclude that the tofu slowed me down by about 20 ms and the effect lasted two days. I didn&#8217;t notice the change in other ways &#8212; I didn&#8217;t feel tired or slow, for example. Presumably that is why this has gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>I think these results reflect cause and effect for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Clarity</strong>. A <em>t</em> value would be very large.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Surprising prediction</strong>. A surprising prediction turned out to be true. Sharp drops like this are rare. Perhaps they happen once every 3-6 months.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Repetition</strong>. A research assistant found similar results, although not as clear. She is Chinese &#8212; quite different genetically.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Other evidence that tofu is bad for the brain</strong>. After I found these results, I remembered <a href="http://www.healthmegamall.com/Articles/BabeskinArticle260.pdf" target="_blank">an old study</a>. It found an association between midlife tofu consumption and late life cognitive decline among Japanese-American men in Hawaii (more tofu, more decline). <a href="http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/soy-online-service/Brain.htm#.UpVOQcRQKm4" target="_blank">A related study</a> of the same men found a correlation between cognitive decline and miso consumption. <a href="http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/141484" target="_blank">A later study of Indonesian men and women</a> also found a correlation between tofu consumption and cognitive decline (more tofu, more decline). The same study also found a <em>beneficial</em> weak correlation between tempeh consumption and cognitive decline (more tempeh, less decline). A weak epidemiological association found only once means little &#8212; epidemiologists, in my experience, do not adjust for the number of tests done and usually ignore the problem.  More recently, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23034522" target="_blank">an experiment using a mouse model of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</a> found that a high-soy diet made brain function worse.</p>
<p>Because of the other evidence, I conclude that all tofu (and other soybean foods, such as soy milk) probably impair brain function, not just this version, which contains slightly more than tofu. The other evidence involves lots of non-fermented tofu. Because of the other evidence and my assistant&#8217;s results, I believe these results will be true for other people.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t explain the effect. Tofu is high in omega-6, but the amount of omega-6 in 20 g of tofu is small. Others think that tofu impair brain function due to its isoflavones.</p>
<p>Most nutrition experts say tofu is good for you. Catherine Newman, in <em>O Magazine</em>, <a href="http://www.oprah.com/health/The-Health-Benefits-of-Tofu-and-Soy-Products" target="_blank">raves about it</a>. &#8220;In addition to being wonderfully inexpensive, tofu is high in protein, low in fat, and very low in saturated fat. . . .  One daily four-ounce [= 120 g] serving is an excellent addition to a healthy diet.&#8221; <a href="http://w3.newsmax.com/newsletters/mhr/issues/eat1012/mhr_eat1012_29.pdf" target="_blank"><em>The Mind Health Report</em> (October 2012)</a> says tofu is good for the brain. &#8220;For vegetarians, good choices are tofu, beans and eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Better informed experts criticize soy but say <em>fermented</em> soy is good. <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/09/18/soy-can-damage-your-health.aspx" target="_blank">Joseph Mercola</a> wrote,&#8221;For centuries, Asian people have been consuming fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits.&#8221; The <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/" target="_blank">Weston Price Foundation website</a> says a lot about the badness of soy but claims fermented soy is healthy. In an article about why unfermented soy is bad, <a href="http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/170-scientific-reasons-to-lose-the-soy-in-your-diet/" target="_blank">the Healthy Home Economist says</a>, &#8220;Please note that fermented soy in small, condimental amounts as practiced in traditional Asian cultures is fine for those who have healthy thyroid function [as I do -- Seth].&#8221; My 20 g dose was a small, condimental amount. John Robbins, author of <em>The Food Revolution </em>(2001), dismissed the association of tofu and dementia. <a href="http://www.foodrevolution.org/askjohn/52.htm" target="_blank">He argued</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s not all we know. We know, for example, that dementia rates are lower in Asian countries (where soy intake is high) than in western countries. We know that the Japanese lifestyle (with its high soy intake) has long been associated with longer life span and better cognition in old age. And we know that Seventh Day Adventists, many of whom consume soyfoods their whole lives, have less dementia in old age than the general population. . . . A number of clinical studies have shown that soy and isoflavones from soy are actually beneficial for cognition. . . . . Having studied the literature, soy researchers Mark and Virginia Messina conclude that “there is no reason to believe that eating soyfoods is harmful to brain aging.” [Robbins failed to mention that <a href="http://www.vegnutrition.com/about/index.html" target="_blank">Mark and Virginia Messina</a> own a "nutrition consulting company specializing in soyfoods nutrition" -- Seth]</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when the Messinas said this. Maybe there was once &#8220;no reason&#8221; to think soyfoods bad for the brain, but there is now.  The new evidence, epidemiology, and mouse evidence make a good case.</p>
<p>Here are two interesting things. 1. A very popular food is dangerous, maybe harmful. 2. Nutrition experts had claimed the opposite: the food is good for you. Even the better ones (Mercola, Weston Price Foundation) got it wrong, ignoring evidence (the epidemiology). It is a good example of experts overstating their understanding. The Shangri-La Diet is another example (every expert said sugar was fattening, I found it caused me to lose weight).</p>
<p>Even more interesting is the methodological implication. <em>Anyone can do what I did, with any food</em>. It&#8217;s easy, safe, cheap, and takes little time. The bad effects were large enough, and the method sensitive enough, that the bad effects were well above noise. And this is a non-trivial case. Tofu is popular.</p>
<p>We eat thousands of foods. We have millions of genotypes. We eat our food in millions of environments. Your genotype and environment affect how a food will affect you. So a good understanding of how foods affect us would seem to require thousands times millions times millions of tests. It is absurd to assume that anyone else (government, academia, industry) will do the necessary tests. They can&#8217;t <em>begin</em> to do the tests. In contrast to people doing a job (for example, people in government responsible for food safety) <strong>you</strong> have a much simpler problem: <strong>Is my food safe for me? </strong>You only care about one genotype (yours) and one context (yours) and you eat far fewer than thousands of foods. You can do good tests. You can test exactly what you eat in exactly the context you eat it. Compared to the present, where we extrapolate from epidemiology, animal tests, and the rare human experiment, the reduction in uncertainty and increase in generalizability is immense.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">If you want to do experiments like this &#8212; test foods one by one &#8212; with my software (which requires Windows), please contact me. The tests require a training period of 1-2 months so that the scores during an experiment are roughly constant.</span></p>

Vast amounts of money and time have been spent studying heart disease, but, judging by the great emphasis on an almost useless method of prevention (statins), the researchers who spent the money and time didn&#8217;t do effective research. Cancer could have a hundred different causes. Heart disease, probably not.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Korean artist named <a href="http://www.savefoodfromthefridge.com/" target="_blank">Jihyun Ryou</a> has invented <a href="http://www.notechmagazine.com/2012/01/saving-food-from-the-fridge.html" target="_blank">modules to keep food fresh without refrigeration</a>. This connects with the themes of this blog in several ways: using science to find cheap safe low-tech solutions,  minimal solutions (Ryou&#8217;s designs use no electricity, I try to find solutions that require no willpower), and increasing (rather than reducing) the microbial content of food. Food stored at room temperature will have more microbes than food stored cold. Ryou says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve learned that we hand over the responsibility of taking care of food to the technology, the refrigerator. We don’t observe the food any more and we don’t understand how to treat it.</p></blockquote>
<p>That there could be something wrong with division of labor &#8212; handing over tasks to specialists, including specialist machines &#8212; is a subtle point. Division of labor works fine for inanimate things, such cloth and furniture and pencils. No economist has realized that animate things (such as our bodies) might be different.</p>
<p>The value of Ryou&#8217;s designs partly rests on the variability of living things, as does the value of personal science. Well-educated Americans, in my experience, have little idea what they lose when they hand over care of their body to experts, such as doctors and drug companies. As Ryou says, they lose a kind of mental fitness (&#8220;we don&#8217;t observe the food any more,&#8221; we don&#8217;t observe ourselves as closely) and are forced to accept solutions in which what the experts want plays a big role. I discovered the power of self-experimentation when I decided to see for myself if the acne medicine my doctor had prescribed was working. I found it wasn&#8217;t, a possibility the doctor hadn&#8217;t mentioned.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=196334975274806517&amp;postID=3161635954700370250">this comment from Art Ayers</a> deep in a discussion on his excellent blog <a href="http://coolinginflammation.blogspot.com/">Cooling Inflammation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Probiotic fermenting bacteria only work in the upper part of the gut, not in the colon. The anaerobic bacteria that work in the colon must be slowly acquired by persistent eating of diverse veggies to provide diverse polysaccharides and uncooked veggies to provide the bacteria.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree and disagree. It&#8217;s an excellent point that the bacteria near the stomach are quite different from the bacteria deep in the colon. So you need different sources of each. I don&#8217;t know what &#8220;probiotic fermenting bacteria&#8221; are (I was under the impression that all bacteria &#8220;ferment&#8221;), but, yeah, bacteria that live on lactose (e.g., in yogurt) are going to be quite different than bacteria that live on more complex sugars that are digested more slowly than lactose and thus pass further into the intestine.</p>
<p>To me, this explains why I like vegetables. I have no trouble avoiding fruit, bread, rice, pasta, and so on, but I hate meals without vegetables. Why? This line of thought suggests it is because they supply complex polysaccharides needed for deep-colon health. As Ayers implies, you wouldn&#8217;t need a lot. This line of thought suggests how you or nutrition scientists can decide what fermented foods to eat (some for each part of the digestive system).</p>
<p>I disagree about raw vegetables. Like most people, I don&#8217;t like raw vegetables. I like the crunchiness but the taste is too weak. That most people are like me is suggested by the fact that raw vegetables are almost never eaten without dip or dressing (which add fat and flavor) or something done to make them more palatable (e.g., sugar and liquid from tomatoes). If raw vegetables were important, even necessary, for health, the fact that they are hard to eat would make no evolutionary sense.</p>
<p>I do like pickled/fermented vegetables of all sorts, such as kimchi and sauerkraut. I believe they are a far better source of the bacteria you need than raw vegetables (they have far more of the bacteria that grow on raw vegetables than ordinary raw vegetables).</p>
