For the last few months, one segment has been about the misuse of <em>so</em>: People use it to start sentences that aren&#8217;t about consequences (&#8220;So we were standing there minding our own business. . . .&#8221;). I wrote Shearer to say he should change the name from <em>Le Show</em> to <em>Le So</em>. Not long after that, he ended the <em>so</em> segment with &#8220;here on <em>Le So</em>&#8220;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a Chinese friend of mine was in first grade, she was habitually late for school. Usually about ten minutes. Her mom took her to school on a bike. One day she was 20 minutes late. The door was closed. My friend opened the door. &#8220;May I come in?&#8221; she asked the teacher. The teacher came to the door. She took my friend to the front of the class. &#8220;Here is Queen Late (迟到大王),&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, including my friend. She thought it was a funny thing to say, not mean. The name stuck. Many years later, she was called Queen Late by those who knew her in primary school. Her teacher was not a great wit. Other students at other schools were called the same thing. It was/is a standard joke.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think Chinese have, on average, a better sense of humor than Americans, but who really knows? A more interesting contrast is how lateness is handled. At UC Berkeley, about 20 years ago, I attended a large lecture class (Poli Sci 3, Comparative Politics) taught by Ken Jowitt, a political science professor. Jowitt was considered an excellent lecturer, which was why I was there, but he was also famous for being hard on students who came in late. When I was there, a student came in late. Jowitt interrupted what he was saying to point out the offender and said something derogatory.  I don&#8217;t remember what Jowitt said but I do remember thinking &#8212; as someone who also taught large lecture classes where students came in late &#8212; that he was making a mountain, an unattractive mountain, out of a molehill. It didn&#8217;t occur to me to wonder how he could have dealt with the problem in a way that made everyone laugh.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I heard Gary Shteyngart (latest book <a href="http://supersadtruelovestory.com/"><em>Super Sad True Love Story</em></a>) at the Beijing Bookworm. No better job of authorial self-promotion have I seen. He was born in Leningrad in 1972, he grew up hearing jokes from his parents. For example: The 1980 Summer Olympics were in Moscow. At the time, Brezhnev was in charge. He was going senile. At an Olympic ceremony,  he gave a speech. His hands shook holding the text of his talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohhhhhh&#8230;..&#8221; he read.</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohhhhh&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohhhhh&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>An apparatchik ran up to him. &#8220;Senior Comrade Brezhnev, those are the Olympic Rings!&#8221;</p>
<p>The moderator asked Shteyngart what he thought of Putin&#8217;s plan to require every Russian teenager to read a specified 100 great books by graduation. &#8220;These things never work,&#8221; said Shteyngart. &#8220;American cities have done this. Everyone&#8217;s supposed to read a certain book, usually <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. Never tell someone what to read.&#8221; However, he said one of his favorite authors is Karen Russell. (For a <em>New Yorker</em> podcast, he read a story by Andrea Lee.)</p>
<p>I asked about his favorite TV shows. He mentioned <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>The Wire</em>, and <em>Breaking Bad</em>. &#8220;Who would have guessed that TV would become a great art form?&#8221; He is writing a show for HBO about Brooklyn immigrants.</p>
<p>I learned that he was <a href="http://www.drunkard.com/issues/06_06/06_06_gary_shteyngart.html">interviewed</a> by a magazine called <a href="http://www.drunkard.com"><em>Modern Drunkard</em></a>. The interviewer &#8212; not Shteyngart &#8212; mentions an Russian saying: &#8220;The church is near, but the road is icy. The bar is far away, but I will walk carefully.” How true.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melody McLaren, whose giant greeting card <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2011/02/04/humor-as-catalyst/">I described a few days ago</a>, told me another example of using humor to change behavior:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was working at LA Incentives, a small promotional merchandise company in Barnes (southwest London). We  (Liz Amies, the MD and I) were running a very small company in  the midst of a recession (1987-1990). We were having difficulty getting our  clients to pay us on time.Â  Money was tight for everyone and the big  companies were notoriously late at paying small suppliers, who had no  resources to hire people to chase their debts.</p>
<p>So, being  desperate, I tried the humor route once again (this was a couple of  years after the ad agency incident).Â  I drew cartoons that  illustrated why clients might not be paying us &#8211; e.g. &#8220;You&#8217;re probably  just trapped under something heavy&#8221; under a  crude illustration of a guy pinned to the floor by a filing cabinet.Â   Weird, whimsical stuff.Â  I faxed the cartoons to the companies&#8217; purchase  ledger departments.Â  Although this didn&#8217;t work with everyone, quite a  few people paid up immediately. It was the power of surprise, I  guess.Â  No wars were stopped by this approach &#8211; but it did help us keep  the company afloat for a while longer.</p></blockquote>
<p>So effective you might think it would be obvious, but it isn&#8217;t. Although economists have a hard time using anything but incentives to explain economic behavior, notice that no incentives were changed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://ted.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=07487d1456302a286cf9c4ccc&#038;id=d0f7ffa903&#038;e=0e83937122">this TED video</a> Lisa Donnelly, a cartoonist, says</p>
<p align="center">women + humor = change</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what changes she means. But I think she is saying something important. Humor has a way of making change easier.<br />
In the 1980s a friend of mine named Melody McLaren worked as a personal assistant in a London advertising agency. One of her co-workers was a woman named Denise Taylor. Denise was the personal assistant of the managing director, Chris Ogilvie-Taylor. Normally personal assistants get a nameplate on the appropriate door but Denise did not because her boss, Ogilvy-Taylor, was worried about the appearance of nepotism.<br />
Everybody &#8212; except perhaps Ogilvie-Taylor &#8212; thought this was unfair. But Ogilvie-Taylor&#8217;s boss was on a different floor. It would have been dangerous and strange to appeal to him.</p>
<p>My friend conceived a brilliant and surprising solution. She wrote a long poem, maybe 60 lines long, with rhyming couplets, about an imaginary town of Taylors (a play on &#8220;tailor&#8221;). The point of the poem was that Denise deserved her name on the door. Then, with the help of the art department, my friend wrote the poem on a giant card, about six feet high. The card was passed around the office. Everyone signed it. Then it was put in Mr. Johnson&#8217;s office. Soon Denise got a nameplate.</p>
<p>This was not exactly humor &#8212; more like whimsy, with humorous elements. It facilitated change.</p>
<p>Another example comes from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/world/asia/18li.html?pagewanted=2&#038;sq=chinese%20blogger%20li%20gang&#038;st=Search&#038;scp=1">a Chinese blogger</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Oct. 20, a female blogger in northern China nicknamed Piggy Feet Beta  announced a contest to incorporate the phrase â€œLi Gang is my fatherâ€  into classical Chinese poetry. Six thousand applicants replied, one  modifying a famous poem by Mao  to read â€œitâ€™s all in the past, talk  about heroes, my father is Li Gang.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>Here too we have the three elements: woman, humor, change.</p>
<p>A friend of mine from Poland was surprised we had jokes in America. He thought the sole purpose of humor was to criticize the government. And our government was pretty good.</p>
<p>Sure, jokes are a way of saying the unsayable (e.g., dirty jokes). Sure, they can empower the weak, not just the strong (e.g., racist jokes). What&#8217;s interesting here is (a) Donnelly felt her equation was interesting (she&#8217;s right), meaning most of her audience didn&#8217;t know it; (b) she didn&#8217;t illustrate it well (why not?); (c) humor can be useful in everyday life (as my friend&#8217;s example shows), not just to criticize the government. I think this point should be incredibly obvious, like the sky is blue, but it isn&#8217;t.</p>

He showed me his notes. &#8220;The Door-in-the-Face Effect&#8221; was the heading of a little graph he&#8217;d drawn. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;If you get someone to help you in a little way, they&#8217;re more likely to help you in a big way later,&#8221; he said. I knew that result. It&#8217;s called the<em> <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&#038;id=1989-27177-001&#038;CFID=27027292&#038;CFTOKEN=43085010">foot-in-the-door effect</a></em>. &#8220;Your teacher made a mistake,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>I was wrong. There is a <a href="http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/986334_770849120_713690244.pdf">door-in-the-face effect</a> very similar to the foot-in-the-door effect. The door-in-the-face effect is after you make a big request that is turned down, you are more likely to get agreement to a small request.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <em>cold joke</em> is a sort of nonsensical joke that is funny because it&#8217;s not funny, sort of like <a href="http://www.radosh.net/archive/002497.html">the <em>New Yorker</em> Anti-Cartoon Caption Contest</a>. Two examples:</p>
<p>1. A piece of bread was walking down the street. It got hungry, so it ate itself.</p>
<p>2. <span id="ctl00_cphMainContent_lbQuestion">Hanging in the hallway at Whites High School in Wabash, Indiana, are basketball team photos. In the center of the front row in each picture someone holds a basketball identifying the year: &#8220;62-63&#8243;, &#8220;63-64&#8243;, &#8220;64-65&#8243;, etc. One day I saw a freshman looking at the photos. Turning to me, he said,&#8221;Isn&#8217;t it strange how the teams always lost by one point?&#8221;</span></p>
