				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Allan Folz</h4>
<p>My story of omega 3 and self-experimentation did not end with my wife and her pregnancy. As I mentioned, I discovered the paleo diet, Vitamin D, and fish oil all about the same time. Mostly for reasons of general good health we began supplementing with vitamin D and fish oil (Mega-EPA Omega-3 supplement). I ordered some of each from the same place online and we began supplementing both at the same time, around January-February of 2010.<span id="more-13522"></span></p>
<p>At the time my son was in kindergarten and having problems socializing at school. He had them at home too, but we&#8217;d all adjusted to them at home. He exhibited a lot of what would be called typical spectrum issues, though I was certain he didn&#8217;t have anything approaching Asperger&#8217;s. Things that interested him, such as building with Legos playing outside with or without friends, he did quite well. It struck me that he was a high-energy boy who didn&#8217;t appreciate receiving directions, desk work, or anything requiring moderation and self-reflection. I like to joke that Tom Sawyer is hardly a modern archetype.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he was having problems. The Vitamin D Council web site had a number of very persuasive anecdotes from parents about autistic children cured by Vitamin D. Our son wasn&#8217;t autistic, but autism involves several behaviors, and he had a few of them. He didn&#8217;t make good eye contact when talking or being talked to. He wouldn&#8217;t follow directions if he didn&#8217;t feel an intrinsic motivation to follow them. He could not fall asleep and would often lay in bed restless for an hour or more at night. The Vitamin D Council recommended 2000 IU per 50 lb/day, so that&#8217;s what we all took. We also took one fish oil capsule a week. At the time I thought of omega-3 only being for heart health. This made me a little skeptical about how much was really required. We seemed a healthy family, so I figured our needs were modest. One capsule a week seemed well beyond the norm so we should be good.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after beginning the supplements my son&#8217;s behavior improved. I was pleasantly surprised and attributed it to the Vitamin D based on what I&#8217;d read on the Vitamin D Council web site. It wasn&#8217;t a cure by any means, but it was a very noticeable improvement. He would still have bad days, and I was a little bummed that after the initial improvement the Vitamin D didn&#8217;t seem to be helping any further. However, I figured such is real-life outside of attention-grabbing headlines.</p>
<p>Two years later, January and February of 2012, second grade for him, and about a year and a half after the self-experiment with my wife during her third pregnancy, my son&#8217;s behavior dramatically worsened. We were all still taking D, but at that point it was obviously not showing any benefit for my son. He was in a worse place than when he was in kindergarten. I resigned myself to Vitamin D not being his problem, and at his teacher&#8217;s demand signed him up for outside testing.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t notice at the time, but we had run out of the “fish oil” over Christmas break. The second week of January we visited family in the Midwest. When we returned, school was a nightmare for him and us. My wife and I attributed it to too much TV, bad diet, and not enough sleep while we were visiting family. However, even two and three weeks after our return his problems were worsening. Around the beginning of February, I finally got around to ordering another bottle of the omega-3. I thought of it as mostly being for my wife, who was doing fine, so I didn&#8217;t feel any immediacy. When it finally arrived, we all started taking it again. Immediately his behavior improved. It was such a night and day difference the connection was impossible to miss. It was like kindergarten when he first started taking Vitamin D, only far more so. For the first time in two weeks he wasn&#8217;t angry and crying at the end of the day. That&#8217;s when it occurred to me that in kindergarten he started taking fish oil at the same time as Vitamin D. For the last two years I had been attributing to Vitamin D what was due to the omega-3 supplement. I felt like an idiot.</p>
<p>After that, I did some research on omega-3, fish oil, and ADHD. When I knew what to look for, I found that there were, in fact, a few studies about using omega-3 for ADHD treatment. It seemed that EPA was effectie while DHA was not, or at best, less effective than EPA. When I took a closer look at our “fish oil,” I remember thinking to myself, &#8220;Oh wow, this stuff is Mega-EPA. How lucky is that.&#8221; I had chosen it almost at random. It had the best per-dose price and was listed as a top seller.</p>
<p>In retrospect, were it not for the pain and difficulty experienced by my son, it would be funny how the answer was under my nose the whole time. I was slow to appreciate it because of my own prejudice and not treating the problem as something to scientifically test. I thought of omega-3 as being for heart health. I&#8217;d never seen it mentioned in relation to emotional health or brain development, outside of the usual bromides about eating walnuts and so forth. Plus the recommendations are always couched in generalities without specific dosage guidelines. Even after I discovered it made a difference for my pregnant wife, it didn&#8217;t occur to me to test it seriously on my son. Their symptoms and nutritional needs seemed unrelated.</p>
<p>A few weeks later we saw the professional who had tested our son to go over the results. A few weeks had passed between the evaluation and when we met to discuss the results; it was during that time that I made the omega-3 discovery. I told the professional that our son was getting really good results from the omega-3 supplement. I said that after noticing his results I&#8217;d done some online searching and there were a few scientific studies supporting the use of omega-3 supplements for ADHD. The professional said he was aware of the studies, but the efficacy wasn&#8217;t as certain or as strong compared to the prescription drugs so most people choose the prescriptions. (He sent me the same Bloch &#038; Qawasmi paper Seth linked to in his April 21 Assorted Links.) I wondered if most people were even made aware of the possibility of omega-3 deficiency &#8212; he certainly didn&#8217;t bring it up with us. I would not have found the research papers without first knowing what to look for. I knew what to look for only because of  the discovery I made with my son.</p>
<p>The omega-3 supplement, while a huge improvement, was not an immediate cure. We started giving him two capsules daily which consisted of 800 mg EPA and 400 mg DHA. That seemed to me a lot of omega-3, relative to what one could consume through normal dietary intake. </p>
<p>I was not overly comfortable with that level of dose long-term despite it clearly working. So every couple months or so I&#8217;d have him skip a day or whole weekend. Without fail, his mood noticeably worsened. By the early evening he would be overwhelmed and frustrated to the point of tears by little things that weren&#8217;t going his way, things that were really just the usual complications of life in a household with two parents and two siblings. </p>
<p>A poignant instance of the effects of missing a dose happened in the Fall of the following school year, still 2012. My wife&#8217;s mother came for a visit. The break from routine caused my wife to forget to give our son his omega-3 supplement for three or four days in a row. He might have had them on Sunday, but not on any of the weekdays. By Thursday I had gotten a note and phone call from his teacher about his behavior at school. We had to go and meet with her the following week. At the meeting I shared that we had forgotten to give him the omega-3 capsules due to his grandmother visiting. I saw this as proof it was working. The teacher didn&#8217;t know we had forgotten, and yet his behavior had noticeably regressed. She did not share my awe, and tried to imply that he should be on a prescription. I said that kids can forget prescriptions just as easily and the side effects from a missed prescription are going to be far worse than three days off an omega-3 supplement.</p>
<p>Last month we again ran out of the omega-3 supplement. Except for the accidental occurrence when my wife&#8217;s mother was visiting, this is the first time he&#8217;s been off it for more than a few consecutive days in the two years and two months since I first discovered it helped him. I&#8217;m quite pleased that he seems to be doing OK. There&#8217;s been virtually no difference in his behavior since stopping. However, it&#8217;s not a true cold-turkey quit. We have some of the Green Pastures FCLO infused coconut oil, so he&#8217;s been taking that instead. The manufacturer is vague about its omega-3 content, but my rough estimate is that he&#8217;s taking, a third to a half of his previous dose with the Mega-EPA capsules. Then again, it&#8217;s in the triglyceride form which is supposed to be 50-70% better absorbed on a per-gram basis. Perhaps it&#8217;s a wash. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought about having him try flax oil. There is considerable debate about the efficacy of flax oil and the body&#8217;s ability to synthesize EPA and DHA from ALA, the omega-3 in flax oil. It might be a little late to test efficacy now. The best time to test was one and two years ago when the Mega-EPA supplement was clearly working and had an “efficacy&#8221; half-life of 24 hours. The thought never occurred to me until recently when reading Seth&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t end without sharing some of my frustrations with the state of health science. There is no doubt in my mind that omega-3 helped both my son and my wife deal with some severe and yet common mental health problems. I&#8217;m a pretty sharp, pretty well-read guy that&#8217;s always had an interest in biology and medicine. Outside of a few esoteric corners of the web where you have to know what you&#8217;re looking for in order to find it, omega-3 is something you take for heart health. </p>
<p>I think the comparison with statins is apt. When “heart-healthy whole-grains” don&#8217;t fix one&#8217;s blood makers, and why would they, it&#8217;s very quickly on to prescription drugs (statins). When “use your words” doesn&#8217;t fix a young boy&#8217;s interactions with classmates and teachers, and why would it, it&#8217;s on to prescription drugs. Boys especially are put on incredibly strong pharmaceuticals with well-established risk factors that include stunted growth and suicide. Pharmaceuticals should be tried last, but they are clearly being tried first by frustrated parents and suspect practitioners. It&#8217;s a national shame and a personal outrage.</p>
<p><i>Part 1, about using omega-3 to treat postpartum depression, appeared yesterday. Allan Folz is a software developer in Portland, Oregon. He recently co-founded <a href="http://www.EdisonGauss.com" target="_blank">Edison Gauss Publishing</a>, a software house that makes academically rigorous educational apps for children in grades K-8. Their apps are suitable both classroom and home use, and have proven to be particularly popular among homeschoolers that appreciate a traditional approach to practicing math.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got <em>Cure Unknown: Inside the Lyme Epidemic</em> (2008) by Pamela Weintraub from the library and found something surprising: an angry foreword. Weintraub is a science journalist; the foreword is by Hillary Johnson, another science journalist and apparently a friend of Weintraub&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In her anger, Johnson says several things I say on this blog.<span id="more-13482"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The more Weintraub investigated, the more virtually everyone with a shred of authority was losing their credibility. . . The so-called &#8220;objective&#8221; scientists were sending an entire disease down the river and over the cliff [meaning they ignored it] for reasons that seemed frequently to have more to do with mere opinion and crass external forces &#8212; cash, prestige, careerism &#8212; than with scientific erudition.</p>
<p>She rejected the science writer&#8217;s inbred habit of relying on the government official with the highest pay grade or the scientist with a job at Harvard as the final word on a topic. . . . I think of her, with enormous respect, as a &#8220;recovered&#8221; science journalist.</p>
<p>As one who also suffers from the disease I chronicled with kindred passion in <i>Osler&#8217;s Web</i>, I sometimes wonder if the only investigative writers who will possess the necessary temerity to remove the white gloves and tackle those putative experts to the ground will be those . . whose personal experience demands they follow the rocky trail that leads to the truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last point is the most important, I think. You can curse the careerism of Harvard medical school professors and the servility of science writers but that does nothing, or not much, and what you are upset about (careerism and servility) is unsurprising. Less obvious, at least to me, is that there is a way to overcome the careerism and servility. It <i>still</i> surprises me that I was able to figure out <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">interesting stuff about sleep, obesity, depression and so on</a> that the experts in these fields hadn&#8217;t figured out &#8212; and that sometimes contradicted what they said. (For example, I found sugar <i>isn&#8217;t</i> fattening.) As Johnson says, one reason I was able to learn so much was that I wanted to sleep better, lose weight, be in a better mood, and so on. Unlike the experts in those fields, for whom research was a job.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I learned from a Crest ad that a large fraction of pregnant women, such as half, suffer from gingivitis (inflamed gums). It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.oralb.com/topics/gingivitis-during-pregnancy.aspx" target="_blank">pregnancy gingivitis</a>. The ad recommended better dental hygiene, such as brushing your teeth more.</p>
<p>Thirty years from now will people think <i>how could they</i> [meaning us] <em>have</em><i> been that stupid?</i> Faced with pregnancy gingivitis, they <em>brushed their teeth more? </em>Pregnancy gingivitis is supposedly due to &#8220;hormones&#8221; that increase during pregnancy. In other words, a health expert actually thinks &#8212; or claims to think &#8212; that pregnancy gingivitis has a different explanation than other gingivitis. Yet he doesn&#8217;t know what causes other gingivitis. For example, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gingivitis/basics/causes/con-20021422" target="_blank">here</a> is what Mayo Clinic experts say causes gingivitis. This makes no sense. But it is worse than most nonsense, since fetal health is at stake.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I greatly increased my flaxseed intake because I discovered it improved my balance. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-and-gum-health/" target="_blank">My gums suddenly went from red (inflamed) to pink (not inflamed)</a>, no doubt because flaxseed has lots of omega-3, which is anti-inflammatory. Gingivitis is &#8212; usually? always? &#8212; caused by too little omega-3.</p>
<p>My theory: pregnancy gingivitis happens because pregnant women need more omega-3 than usual. A growing brain needs lots of omega-3.  If this theory turns out to be true, the gums of pregnant women should be monitored to make sure they are getting enough omega-3. Nowadays pregnant women are given omega-3 to take but there is no test to make sure it is enough. That pregnancy gingivitis is common suggests it often isn&#8217;t enough. Actually, everyone&#8217;s gums should be checked to make sure they are getting enough omega-3.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On <a href="http://econtalk.org/" target="_blank">Econtalk</a>, Russ Roberts recently <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/03/jeffrey_sachs_o.html" target="_blank">interviewed Jeffrey Sachs</a>, author of <i>The End of Poverty</i> and head of the Millennium Village Project (MVP). I enjoyed it but thought Roberts was too easy on Sachs. Here&#8217;s what I wished he had asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your book, <i>The End of Poverty</i> &#8212; did you get anything wrong?</p>
<p>What mistakes have you made with MVP?</p>
<p>You say Nina Munk [<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/02/14/the-idealist-jeffrey-sachs-and-the-quest-to-end-poverty-by-nina-munk/">author of <i>The Idealist</i></a>] chose a non-representative village. [Sachs said that Munk spent her time in the only village in "a war zone."] Did you tell her that? If not, why not?</p>
<p>Munk was on your side when she began reporting, but changed her mind. Why is that?</p>
<p>Why was the project set up in such a way that evaluation is difficult? Why not pick ten villages and randomly select five for treatment?</p>
<p>You say the MVP project is successful because people are <em>copying</em> it &#8212; but those people are government officials. Is it plausible they are copying it because they see it as a good way to make money for themselves or improve their career? You must know many worthless medical treatments have been widely copied. Is this your best evidence of success?</p>
<p>No doubt your employees have often told you what you wanted to hear rather than the truth. What&#8217;s an example? What have you done to get honest assessments of how things are going?</p>
<p>What did you learn from Nina Munk&#8217;s book?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/03/postmortem_on_s.html" target="_blank">Roberts says</a> he didn&#8217;t ask Sachs certain questions because there wasn&#8217;t enough time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My sister sent me a link to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/opinion/bittman-butter-is-back.html" target="_blank">an article (&#8220;Butter is Back&#8221;) by Mark Bittman</a>, the <i>New York Times</i> food columnist, about a recent review that found saturated fat didn&#8217;t cause heart disease. I told my sister I had clicked on the link but had forgotten to read the article.</p>
<p>My sister was incredulous. <i>How could you not want to say &#8220;I told you so&#8221;?</i> she wondered. (In <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">a 2010 talk</a> I questioned the danger of butter.)</p>
<p>Here is the relevant passage, according to my sister:</p>
<blockquote><p>A meta-analysis published in the journal <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i> found that there’s just no evidence to support the notion that saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. (In fact, there’s some evidence that a lack of saturated fat may be damaging.) The researchers looked at 72 different studies.</p></blockquote>
<p>I told you so. But this part interests me more:</p>
<blockquote><p>No study is perfect and few are definitive. But the real villains in our diet — sugar and ultra-processed foods — are becoming increasingly apparent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh-huh. The experts were staggeringly wrong about saturated fat&#8230;but they couldn&#8217;t possibly be wrong about &#8220;sugar and ultra-processed foods&#8221;. That makes no sense, but that&#8217;s what Bittman wrote (&#8220;increasingly apparent&#8221;). To me, what is increasingly apparent is that nutrition experts shouldn&#8217;t be trusted.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what &#8220;ultra-processed foods&#8221; are but I am beginning to believe the experts are utterly wrong about sugar, too. As far as I can tell, sugar in the evening improves sleep &#8212; by a lot, if you get the details right &#8212; and nothing is more important than good sleep. If you have read <i>The Shangri-La Diet</i>, you already know that sugar alone cannot have caused the obesity epidemic. It is more complicated than that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stuart King writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was very hungry today at dinner and the thought of sweet food wasn&#8217;t appealing at all, but after filling up on some rice, chicken and coconut cream curry I immediately had ice cream and chocolate slice [= what Americans call a brownie], which had had no appeal 15 minutes or so before!</p></blockquote>
<p>An everyday observation that anyone can make. Studies have shown what Stuart noticed: When you are hungry sweet foods are unappealing. This is why dessert is eaten after the rest of the meal.</p>
<p>The main way that psychologists explain an experimental effect &#8212; choose between explanations &#8212; is by finding out what makes the effect larger or smaller. For example, discovery of what makes learning more or less (what increases or decreases the effect of one learning trial) is the main way psychologists have chosen among different theories of learning. Different theories predict different interactions.</p>
<p>Why do we like sweet foods? The usual answers are that sweet foods are a &#8220;good source of energy&#8221; and they provide &#8220;quick energy&#8221;. But these explanations do nothing to explain what Stuart noticed. If sugar is a good (= better than average) source of energy, we should eat it <em>before</em> other foods (average sources of energy) when we are hungry (hunger signals lack of energy). The opposite is true. You may not want to call it a &#8220;contradiction&#8221; but there is no doubt the conventional view does not explain what Stuart noticed. Of course many nutrition experts, such as Weston Price, are/were entirely sure sugar is unhealthy.</p>
<p>As a tool for choosing among theories, Stuart&#8217;s observation is especially good because (a) it is very large (sweets go from unappealing to appealing) and (b) paradoxical (eating calories should make all calorie sources less appealing).</p>
<p>If you have been reading this blog, you know I explain Stuart&#8217;s observation by assuming that we need sugar in the evening to sleep well. Sugar (sucrose, fructose, glucose) eaten in the evening increases blood glucose, which increases glycogen. During sleep, glycogen becomes glucose, which the brain needs to work properly. Evolution shaped us to like sweet foods after a meal so that we will eat them closer to when we sleep. (The value of replenishing glycogen close to bedtime also explains why <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/03/16/the-wisdom-of-google-dessert-honey-and-fruit-closer-to-dinner-than-breakfast-or-lunch/" target="_blank">we eat sweet foods after dinner more than after breakfast or lunch</a>.)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of another case where what experts say is so out of line with what&#8217;s easily observed. For example, I&#8217;m sure cholesterol doesn&#8217;t cause heart disease, but there is no everyday observation that supports my belief.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of another case where what experts say is so out of line with what&#8217;s easily observed. For example, I&#8217;m sure cholesterol doesn&#8217;t cause heart disease, but there is no everyday observation that supports my belief.</p>
<p>If sugar is helpful for sleep, why is it <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0057873" target="_blank">associated with diabetes</a>? My guess is that sugar is almost always consumed in foods that taste exactly the same each time &#8212; what in <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em> I called <em>ditto foods</em>. For example, soft drinks. Ditto foods with sugar, because they have a strong precise CS (smell) and a strong fast US (calorie signal), produce an especially strong smell-calorie association. Such an association raises the body fat set point, thus causing obesity. Obesity causes diabetes. It&#8217;s also possible that eating sugar during the day &#8212; at the wrong time &#8212; hurts sleep. Maybe sugar during the day raises insulin and thus reduces the conversion of sugar to glycogen. Less glycogen causes bad sleep, bad sleep causes diabetes. My blood sugar levels clearly improved when I started eating sweets in the evening &#8212; opposite to what the sugar-diabetes link would predict.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I say that Nobel Prize in Medicine is usually given for research of little or no proven value, one counterexample I&#8217;ve heard is the 2008 prize for the discovery that cervical cancer is caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). This should allow us to reduce cervical cancer via vaccination.</p>
<p>There are several things wrong with this example:</p>
<p>1. The predicted improvement has not been observed. The average age at which a woman is diagnosed with cervical cancer is 48 years old. To assess the effect of HPV vaccination &#8212; usually given to young girls &#8212; on cervical cancer <a href="http://mobile.oralcancersupport.org/dental/pdf/guidelines_for_vacination_2008.pdf" target="_blank">you need to wait thirty years</a>. Thirty years haven&#8217;t passed. The history of medicine is full of examples where treatments that supposedly worked &#8212; such as tonsillectomies, given to millions &#8212; when tested turned out to not work. The history of medicine is also full of examples where supposedly wonderful treatments (e.g., frontal lobotomies) turned out to have side effects so bad the treatment was stopped. </p>
<p>2. Cervical cancer is not a big source of death. In the United States, it kills perhaps five thousand women per year. Heart disease kills hundreds of thousands of people per year; so do all forms of cancer taken together. And pap smears, which cost little, actually work. &#8220;Cervical cancer is 100% curable if detected early,&#8221; <a href="http://www.uihealthcare.org/health-topics-pap-tests-and-cervical-cancer/" target="_blank">says one website</a>.</p>
<p>3. Because pap smears work well, it isn&#8217;t clear there is room for improvement. To find out you&#8217;d want to compare two groups: (a) pap smears plus HPV vaccination and (b) pap smears alone.</p>
<p>4. It isn&#8217;t clear the vaccine will work, even if HPV infection does cause cancer. There are at least 100 varieties of HPV; the vaccine protects against two. Does vaccination against two varieties increase infection by other varieties (because different viruses compete for the same niche)? Hard to rule this out. Again, there are many examples in medicine where actually helping people turned out to be far harder than experts had predicted, even when the initial idea wasn&#8217;t nonsense. An example is the oncogene theory of cancer, which also has a Nobel Prize associated with it.</p>
<p>In summary, not a counterexample.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1995, hoping to improve my sleep, I decided to watch TV early in the morning, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">for reasons explained here</a>. One Monday morning I watched tapes of Jay Leno and David Letterman that I&#8217;d made. Nothing happened. On Tuesday, however, I woke up and felt great: cheerful, eager and yet somehow calm. I had never felt so good so early in the morning. Monday had been a normal day, I had slept a normal length of time. The good feeling was puzzling. Then I remembered the TV I had watched. It had seemed so innocuous. The notion that 20 minutes of ordinary TV Monday morning could make me feel better Tuesday <strong>but not Monday</strong> seemed preposterous. Absurd. Couldn&#8217;t possibly be true.</p>
<p>Except for one thing. I had done something to improve my sleep. Plenty of research connected sleep and depression. That research made it more plausible that something done to improve sleep would improve mood. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">I went on to confirm the morning faces/mood linkage in many ways</a>. The research connecting sleep and depression had been the first signs of a hidden mechanism (we need to see morning faces for our mood regulatory system to work properly) I consider very important.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140131230851.htm" target="_blank">Two new studies</a> further connect sleep and depression. One of them found that people who sleep normal amounts of time are less influenced by genes associated with depression than those who sleep longer or shorter lengths of time. The other found that teenagers who sleep less than usual are at greater risk of depression.</p>
<p>The theories that psychiatrists have used to justify anti-depressants (e.g., &#8220;chemical imbalance&#8221;) do not explain the many connections between sleep and depression. Depression is associated with lots of bad things, unsurprisingly, but the association with bad sleep is especially strong. It is not easily explained away. You might think that if you are depressed you are more tired than usual and therefore sleep more/better than usual. The opposite is true.  All this might have generated, among psychiatric researchers, a search for a better theory &#8212; an explanation of depression that <strong>can</strong> explain the sleep/depression connections &#8212; but it hasn&#8217;t.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When friends complain about evil government (e.g., NSA surveillance), I tell them &#8220;never underestimate the stupidity of government employees&#8221; &#8212; by which I mean their stupidity outweighs their self-interest. The Obamacare website fiasco is a good illustration. Everyone has heard &#8220;power corrupts&#8221; but closer to the truth is power makes you stupid.</p>
<p>The Obama website fiasco had many precursors. One was in the 1950s &#8212; in the details of <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html" target="_blank">the introduction of the polio vaccine</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather than staging a long series of careful field trials with appropriate scientific evaluation, Salk darted ahead on his own in the remainder of 1953 and 1954. The trials were successful. The foundation released the results to the press, and such were the nation’s expectations that from that point there was no turning back. In August 1954 the foundation ordered five drug companies to begin producing mass lots of vaccine, on the basis of a formula for inactivating the virus with formaldehyde, according to a procedure Salk himself had devised. . . . James Shannon remembered very well what happened next. At this point he had become the associate director of the NIH.  “I was working over the weekend and I got a telephone call from Los Angeles, and this is eight or nine o’clock on Friday night. It was the Health officer of the City of Los Angeles and he said they just had two reports of polio in some children who had been vaccinated nine days earlier. He wanted to know what should be done about it?”</p>
<p>One of the companies that contracted to make the vaccine, the Cutter Laboratories in Berkeley, California, had released several lots of vaccine that had been improperly inactivated. Live polio virus was being injected into children. The gratitude of the public turned to horror, as the cutter vaccine gave polio to almost 80 recipients; these children in turn went on to spread the disease to another 120 playmates and relatives; three quarters of the victims were paralysed and 11 died. . . . NIH&#8217;s Laboratory of Biologics Control, which had certified the Salk vaccine, had received advance warning of problems. . . .</p>
<p>In 1954 the rush was on. [Eddy's] lab had gotten samples of the inactivated polio vaccine to certify on a &#8220;due-yesterday&#8221; basis. &#8220;This was a product that had never been made before and they were going to use it right away,” she recalled. She and her staff worked around the clock. &#8220;We had eighteen monkeys. We inoculated these eighteen monkeys with each vaccine that came in. And we started getting paralyzed monkeys.&#8221; She reported to her superiors that the lots were Cutter&#8217;s, and sent pictures of the paralyzed monkeys along as well. &#8220;They were going to be injecting this thing into children. . . .They went ahead and released the vaccine anyway, a lot of it. The monkeys they just disregarded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shannon called the Surgeon General Satur­day morning. Additional cases of paralysis continued to occur. &#8220;It seemed obvious that we had a crisis on our hands, the magnitude of which was unknown.&#8221; Late Saturday afternoon a working group of senior virus specialists, whose advice the polio foundation had started to ignore a year earlier, began meeting in Shannon&#8217;s office. Note that Shannon had completely taken charge of the crisis. &#8220;Sebrell was not the man to manage this,&#8221; DeWitt Stetten recalled. &#8216;James Shannon was a man of quite different character.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shannon had brought in the Surgeon General, who called polio chief Basil O&#8217;Connor in New York. On Monday evening O&#8217;Connor and his advisers came down to Bethesda. Shannon wanted to withdraw the vaccine, &#8220;It was a very stormy meeting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;O&#8217;Connor and the polio group in general disallowed any possibility of induced infections [as a result of the vaccine]. &#8230; So Basil O&#8217;Connor stormed out with dire warning of what he was going to do to the NIH and the Public Health Service. Further vaccination was stopped. I had many sleepless nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The basic problem had really not been the carelessness of the Cutter company, which rightly or wrongly was exonerated in a later report. It was the difficulty in jumping from Salk&#8217;s lab experiments with killing (formalinizing) the virus to large-scale industrial production.</p>
<p>. . . Ruth Kirschstein, the director today of an important NIH institute, added, &#8220;The Cutter incident resulted in everybody up the line who had anything to do with it—very few people know this story—being dismissed because of it.&#8221; All went out: the director of the microbiology institute lost his post, as did the equivalent of the assistant secretary for health. Oveta Culp Hobby, the secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (or Oveta &#8220;Culpable&#8221; Hobby, as she was known), stepped down. Dr. Sebrell, the director of the NIH, resigned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whereas I think the &#8220;basic problem&#8221; was overestimating the competence of powerful people, especially powerful experts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many researchers were shocked when a large 1984 experiment found that a beta-carotene supplement <strong>increased</strong> lung cancer. Because beta-carotene is a potent antioxidant, and epidemiology had linked eating vegetables with less cancer, it was supposed to decrease lung cancer. My Berkeley neighbor Bruce Ames was the foremost proponent of the idea that antioxidants will decrease cancer.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/antioxidants-including-vitamin-e-promote-lung-cancer-study-190119863--finance.html" target="_blank">more evidence</a> supports the idea that antioxidants may increase cancer.</p>
<p>A request for comment elicited this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s disappointing but not surprising that people&#8217;s beliefs are not modified by scientific evidence,&#8221; said Dr Paul Marantz, an epidemiologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. &#8220;People so want to believe there is a magic bullet out there.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One commenter on the article rightly says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s disappointing but not surprising that people&#8217;s beliefs are not modified by scientific evidence,&#8221; . . . Rather a snide comment considering the fact that it was science that spent years telling everyone that antioxidants and supplements were beneficial.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hsu, who has <a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">an excellent blog</a>, recently became Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies at Michigan State University. Before that, he was a professor of physics. At a dinner for faculty promoted to full professor, <a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2013/12/one-in-thousand.html" target="_blank">he said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When an attorney prepares a case it is for her client. When a Google engineer develops a new algorithm, it is for Google &#8212; for money. Fewer than one in a thousand individuals in our society has the privilege, the freedom, to pursue <i>their own</i> ideas and creations. The vast majority of such people are at research universities. A smaller number are at think tanks or national labs, but most are professors like yourselves. It is you who will make the future better than the past; who will bring new wonders into existence.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this blog, in thousands of posts, I have argued a much different view: <strong>everyone</strong> can make the future better than the past in the way Stephen is talking about, by adding to our understanding. In particular, anyone &#8212; not just professional researchers, such as professors at research universities &#8212; can increase our understanding of how to be healthy. This has already started to happen. Some examples:<span id="more-12894"></span></p>
<p>1. Stuart King (a musician) commented <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/11/association-of-sleep-and-chronic-illness/#comment-1150683" target="_blank">how much bedtime honey helped him sleep better</a>. Learning about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">this effect</a> is a big step forward in knowing how to be healthy &#8212; good sleep is at the center of good health. No professional researcher has come close to Stuart&#8217;s insight.</p>
<p>2. Katherine Reid (trained as a protein chemist but not a professor) discovered that if she removed all glutamate from her daughter&#8217;s diet, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/17/journal-of-personal-science-one-childs-autism-eliminated-by-removal-of-glutamate-from-her-diet/" target="_blank">her daughter&#8217;s autism disappeared.</a> This is more progress than any professional researcher has made. None of them has made even one case of autism disappear.</p>
<p>3. Many people told me about how various treatments they learned about from this blog have helped them &#8212; for example Vitamin D3 in the morning and bedtime honey. I recently posted <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/14/bedtime-honey-is-a-godsend/" target="_blank">a comment about bedtime honey</a>, for instance. These treatments are so new and surprising that these experiences are meaningful. They help others decide if these treatments should be taken seriously. (For anyone who dismisses these reports as &#8220;anecdotes&#8221;, I have one question: What have you discovered?)</p>
<p>4. I have used a brain tracking test to find out new things about how my environment affects my brain, including the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">benefits of butter</a> and the <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">bad effect of tofu</a>. At least a billion people &#8212; everyone in China, for starters &#8212; eat tofu regularly. You might think that such a popular food would have been extensively tested for safety but, shockingly, other research supports my conclusion that tofu is bad. Anyone can do the sort of tests I did. Let me repeat my offer to give my brain tracking R software (which only works under Windows) to others who want to use it. There is an associated <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114619130176100669530" target="_blank">Google Community</a> to join.</p>
<p>5. Although I am a professor, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">my self-experimental discoveries about sleep, mood and weight</a> were outside the area of my graduate school training (animal learning). For example, I am not a sleep expert. I made my discoveries without expensive equipment or university resources beyond the library &#8212; that is, I made them with resources to which almost anyone has access.</p>
<p>I am sure these examples are the beginning of something important. They are easy to explain. Who is better equipped to discover important stuff about health, professional researchers (e.g, professors) or non-professionals (the rest of us)? Although professional researchers have big advantages over the rest of us &#8212; this is the usual view &#8212; non-professionals have big advantages over professionals that few people seem aware of. Sometimes the non-professional advantages outweigh the professional advantages and the non-professionals get there first. For example, a professional autism researcher could have done what Reid did (measure the effect of removing all glutamate on autism), but Reid did it first.</p>
<p>The advantages of non-professionals over professionals, a topic I have discussed <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">many times</a>, include:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Ability to self-track and self-experiment</strong>. This is too humble for many professionals. In <em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em>, Thorstein Veblen emphasized that professors like to show off via their work. This is a disaster for science, where small (low status) and fast is much more effective than big (high status) and slow &#8212; a lesson that few health scientists have learned.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Freedom</strong>. Non-professionals can study anything, consider any crazy idea, test any treatment. Professionals must be respectable. Institutional rules and committees also constrain them.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Time</strong>. Non-professionals can study any problem for as long as they want. Professionals must publish regularly.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Motivation</strong>. Because they study their own problems, non-professionals are highly motivated to find the truth. For example, no one cares more about the safety of your food than you do. Professionals usually study problems whose solution gives them no practical benefit. While non-professionals care only about their own health, professionals care a great deal about their career, which makes it <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/11/joseph-biederman-is-still-at-harvard/" target="_blank">quite a bit harder</a> to do the best thing for other people&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>5. <strong>IQ</strong> (which Stephen often blogs about). If you randomly select one professor who studies health, and compare him/her to a thousand randomly-selected non-professionals, the top IQs among the non-professionals will be much higher than the professor&#8217;s IQ.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/" target="_blank">keep writing about this</a> &#8212; hardly saying anything new &#8212; because it is so important, so non-intuitive (in almost every other area of knowledge, such as physics, only professionals make lasting contributions) and no one else says it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <em>New York Times</em>, a writer named Kira Piekoff, a graduate student in Bioethics, tells how <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/science/i-had-my-dna-picture-taken-with-varying-results.html" target="_blank">she sent her blood to three different companies</a>, including 23andMe, for genetic analysis and got back results that differed greatly. As usual, none of the companies told her anything about the error of measurement in their reports, judging from what she wrote. So she&#8217;s naive and they&#8217;re naive (or dishonest). Fine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m unsurprised that a graduate student in bioethics has no understanding of measurement error. What&#8217;s fascinating is that the experts she consulted didn&#8217;t either, judging by what they said.</p>
<p>A medical ethicist named Arthur L. Caplan weighed in. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ‘risk is in the eye of the beholder’ standard is not going to work.We need to get some kind of agreement on what is high risk, medium risk and low risk. [Irrelevant -- Seth] If you want to spend money wisely to protect your health and you have a few hundred dollars, buy a scale, stand on it, and act accordingly.</p></blockquote>
<p>As if blood sugar and blood pressure measurements aren&#8217;t useful. <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30190013/" target="_blank">A good scale costs $15</a>.</p>
<p>A director of clinical genetics named Wendy Chung said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if they are accurately looking at 5 percent of the attributable risk, they’ve ignored the vast majority of the other risk factors — the dark matter for genetics — because we as a scientific community haven’t yet identified those risk factors.</p></blockquote>
<p>She changed the subject.</p>
<p>J. Craig Venter, the famous gene sequencer, does not understand the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your results are not the least bit surprising. Anything short of sequencing is going to be short on accuracy — and even then, there’s almost no comprehensive data sets to compare to.</p></blockquote>
<p>The notion that &#8220;anything short of [complete] sequencing&#8221; cannot be helpful is absurd, if I understand what &#8220;short on accuracy&#8221; means. He reminds me of doctors who don&#8217;t understand that a <em>t</em> test corrects for sample size. They believe any study with less than 100 subjects cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>I told a friend recently that I have become very afraid of doctors. For exactly the reason illustrated in these quotes, from well-known experts who are presumably much more competent than any doctor I am likely to see. The experts were unable to comment usefully on something as basic as measurement error. Failing to understand basics makes them easy marks &#8212; for drug companies, for example &#8212; just as the writer of the article was an easy mark for the experts, who managed to be quoted in the <i>Times</i>, making them appear competent. Surely almost any doctor will be worse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One reason personal science is a good idea is it is simple and immediate (in the sense of near). You study one person, you do experiments (easier to interpret than surveys), you can easily repeat the experiment (so you are not confused by secular trends &#8212; big changes over time &#8212; and implausible statistical assumptions), you are aware of unusual events during the experiment (so you are less confused by anomalous results and outliers), you are close to the data collection (so you understand the limits and error rates of the measurements). These elements make good interpretation of your data much easier. Professional science generally lacks some of these elements. For example, the person who writes the paper may not have collected the data. This makes it harder to understand what the data mean.</p>
<p>I hear criticism of (professional) science more now than ten years ago. Lack of replicability, for example. What I rarely hear &#8212; actually, never &#8212; is how often science critics make big blunders. As far as I can tell, as often as those they criticize. This is not to say they are wrong &#8212; who knows. Just overstated.<br />
An example is <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/2/311.full#ref-7" target="_blank">a critique of salt and blood pressure studies</a> I read recently. Many people say salt raises blood pressure. The critique, by Michael Alderman, a professor of epidemiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said, <em>not so fast</em>. The title is: &#8220;Salt, blood pressure and health: a cautionary tale.&#8221; It&#8217;s a good review, with lots of interesting data, but the reviewer, at the same time he is criticizing others, makes a major blunder.</p>
<p>He describes a study in which people were placed on a low-salt diet. Their blood pressure was measured twice, before the diet (Time 1) and after they had been on the diet for quite a while (Time 2). Comparison of the two readings showed a wide range of changes. Some people&#8217;s blood pressure went up, some people&#8217;s blood pressure stayed the same, and some people&#8217;s blood pressure went down. Alderman called this result &#8220;enormous variation between individuals on the effect of salt on pressure&#8221;. Oh no! He assumes that if your blood pressure is different at Time 2 than Time 1, it was because of the change in dietary salt. There are dozens of possible reasons a person&#8217;s blood pressure might differ at the two times (leaving aside measurement error, another possibility). Dozens of things that affect blood pressure were not kept constant.</p>
<p>Had there been a second group that did not change their diet and was also measured at Time 1 and Time 2 &#8212; and had the subjects given the low-salt diet showed a larger spread of Time 2/Time 1 difference scores than the no-change group, then you could reasonably conclude that there was variation in the response to the low-salt diet. To conclude &#8220;enormous variation&#8221; you&#8217;d want to see an enormous increase in difference-score variability. But there was no second group.</p>
<p>This is not some small detail. Alderman actually believes there is great variation in response to salt reduction. It is the main point of his article. <i>Spy</i> magazine had a great column called Review of Reviewers. Such as book and movie reviewers. Unfortunately there is no such thing in science.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/20/dispatches-from-the-front-lines-of-personal-science-why-did-i-sleep-so-well/" target="_blank">A few days ago I noted</a> that I had slept unusually well. I wondered why. The previous day had been unusual in five ways (yogurt blueberries and honey 2 hours before bedtime, only one blackout curtain, chocolate, unusual timing of morning faces, new brand of honey). Was one of them responsible? Or was it random variation?</p>
<p>The next day I repeated four of the five unusual things: only one blackout curtain, chocolate, unusual timing of morning faces, new brand of honey. Result: I did <strong>not</strong> sleep unusually well. This pointed to either yogurt blueberries and honey or random variation as the explanation. Those happened to be the explanations I had considered most plausible (yogurt blueberries and honey) and least plausible (random variation).</p>
<p>Yesterday I repeated all five of the unusual things. Yesterday evening it took longer than usual to fall asleep. Usually I fall asleep within a minute, but this time it took about 4 minutes. As I was lying there, I attributed the long latency to lack of exercise that day. In the morning, for the first time in my whole life, I woke up what a friend called &#8220;full of jitters&#8221;. Very rested, yes, but also too much energy. As if I&#8217;d had too much caffeine. Usually I have a cup of black tea first thing in the morning. I started to make one and realized it would make things worse, not better. As I said, this has never happened before.</p>
<p>So it was the yogurt blueberries and honey. The first time I had it I had added the honey just for sweetener and hadn&#8217;t measured it. The second time I did measure the honey &#8212; 14 g, about 2 teaspoons. Probably more than I had used the first time, which may explain the different results (1st time: very rested, 2nd time: very rested and jittery). Both times I ate 125 g blueberries, which has 12 g sugar (half glucose, half fructose). I doubt the yogurt (homemade, no sugar added) matters.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best dose (for me) will turn out to be one teaspoon honey 2 hours before bedtime <strong>and</strong> one tablespoon of honey at bedtime. I had tried taking more than one tablespoon of honey at bedtime; it seemed to produce the same effect as one tablespoon. </p>
<p>I want to test with and without blueberries, of course, and different amounts of honey 2 hours before bedtime. If honey alone is powerful, then I will test different forms of sugar. I don&#8217;t want to be at the mercy of differences between brands of honey, although honey is very convenient.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say it turns out to be the sugar in honey that produces these big improvements in sleep. Then it will turn out that the nutritionists of the world have been even more wrong about sugar than they were about saturated fat. All the data is not yet in, let me repeat. But the data so far unquestionably point in a surprising direction. It is entirely possible that sugar &#8212; in the right amounts at the right times of day &#8212; will turn out to be the greatest health food of all.</p>
<p>Which would explain what has never been well-explained: why we like it so much.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I posted that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">tofu made me stupid</a> &#8212; made me slower on a reaction-time test &#8212; a reader named Ann, who lives in Florida, said she had discovered that her migraine headaches were caused by soy. How she discovered this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was 49 years old and in that hot flashes stage of life, had read that soy could help alleviate them and tried a soy capsule not at a meal, immediately noticed sinus pressure and itchiness.</p>
<p>So I started reading all labels and eliminated soy from my diet and my migraines and sinus headaches went away! The hot flashes eventually went away on their own. I was losing whole days every month to the migraines. Every now and then the soy sneaks in at a restaurant but not as bad as before. Whenever anyone says they have migraines I always suggest looking at soy. Regretfully my daughter has the same issue, but she has way fewer headaches after eliminating soy.</p>
<p>I used to blame a lot of my headaches on allergies, never thinking it could be something I was eating. At age 60 now, my cholesterol numbers are excellent and I weigh 122 pounds when so many of my friends are overweight.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked how long it had taken to discover this.</p>
<blockquote><p>I had been having migraines for years, 10-20, but in the mid 90s they got worse (could have coincided with more soy in food).  Saw a doctor but he just prescribed imitrex which helped but did not prevent them. He never suggested looking for a food cause. It was dumb luck or divine intervention that I tried that soy capsule in 2001 or 2002. I am often amazed at how much better I feel health wise since then. Since soy is in so much processed food my diet is very basic &#8220;real&#8221; food. Raw fruits and veggies, plain nuts, fresh meat, real cheese, eggs, yogurt, any desserts I make from scratch with real butter. I&#8217;m always excited when I find a cracker that doesn&#8217;t have soy since that&#8217;s usually my bread substitute.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me repeat part of that: A doctor she saw because of migrains did not suggest trying to find an environmental cause. The same thing happened to <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html" target="_blank">a woman I wrote about for Boing Boing</a>. Her doctor just prescribed one drug after another. Her migraines turned out to be caused by cleaning products. Not knowing that migraines often have environmental causes is like not knowing the germ theory of disease. </p>
<p>Few soy eaters realize the dangers of soy, as far as I can tell. I wrote to one of them, <a href="http://www.theveganrd.com/about" target="_blank">Virginia Messina</a>, a nutritionist who has said &#8220;there is no reason to believe that eating soyfoods is harmful to brain aging.&#8221; She has not replied.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://uhs.berkeley.edu/home/healthtopics/pdf/triggers.pdf" target="_blank">long list of possible migraine triggers</a> (from the UC Berkeley health service) does <strong>not</strong> list soy, although it does mention soy sauce. It says soy milk should be safe. In a 2006 interview,  <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5364970" target="_blank">one headache doctor</a> recommended avoiding all soy. In the comments to <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/01/24/migraine-triggers-may-not-be-so-potent-after-all/" target="_blank">this</a>, a woman says:</p>
<blockquote><p>SOY is the biggest trigger for my migraines.  For years I suffered daily from migraines but after watching EVERYTHING I eat and reading all labels and avoiding SOY as best I can I am doing better.  The biggest problem is that SOY is in everything!!!!  I think one day they will find out how bad it is for us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine that. Putting something that damages the brain in everything.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reader of this blog named Nile McAdams, who lives in Minnesota, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I read <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/05/honey-at-bedtime-improves-sleep/" target="_blank">your first blog post</a> about honey I was gobsmacked. Not so much by the improved sleep &#8212; the idea of a bedtime snack improving sleep has been around a long time &#8212; but by the fact that a tablespoon of honey could double the time you were able to stand on one leg. [One bent leg. After being roughly constant for a year, the time doubled in two weeks. -- Seth] Impossible!! Not that I thought you were lying &#8212; I didn’t &#8212; it is just that a lot can go wrong between collecting the data and interpreting the data. So I had to try it for myself.<span id="more-12340"></span></p>
<p>A little back story. In June I began lifting lifting some 40-pound dumbbells I had laying around. I would hold one in each hand and then, alternating arms, lift them over my head for a total of 10 lifts &#8212; 5 for each arm (right arm, left arm, right arm, and so on). For me, the dumbbells were very heavy. I had trouble keeping them stable especially with my left, weaker, arm. Every time I lifted I had a little anxiety that I would lose control and the dumbbell would come crashing down and break stuff. The last straw was that I wasn’t really getting better or not getting better fast enough. I lifted almost every day for a month or so but then gradually drifted away. Here is the point of the back story: I had very minor improvement, if any, over the course of that month. I felt a little stronger and I may have been able to do 12 lifts but I was too unsure of how steady I would be on lifts 11 and 12 so I never tried it.</p>
<p>When I decided to try the experiment with honey I thought that these dumbbells would be a good test of strength. I am 70 years old and quite obese &#8212; 6’ and 300 lbs. I take 2 or 2 ½ tablespoons of honey right before I go to bed &#8212; my thinking is that my body mass could be almost double yours or other people taking honey so I should adjust the dose a little bit.</p>
<p>I started lifting on the same day I took the honey or perhaps the day after I took the honey. Here are my dumbbell lifts by day.</p>
<div></div>
<div>10,10,10,10,10,10,12,10,[three day gap]</div>
<div></div>
<p>I went to Chicago for a long weekend so I did not lift that Friday, Saturday or Sunday. I also did not take any honey.  I didn&#8217;t think much of the day I had lifted 12 times, even though it is a 20% improvement.  I felt it was similar to when I was lifting back in June &#8212; random variation.  Here are my lifts since I came back from Chicago after missing 3 days.</p>
<div></div>
<div>16,14,16,20,14,20,18, 22,16,[1 day gap],22,24</div>
<div></div>
<p>These lifts are outside the bounds of any random variation as far as I&#8217;m concerned. In 15 days I doubled my lift with weights I had prior experience with!! This is incredible! The effect is real, at least for me.</p></blockquote>
<p>A prediction of something that sounds impossible (bedtime honey quickly doubles a measure of strength) is confirmed &#8212; how often does that happen? I agree with the underlying idea. Lots of things improve sleep. It isn&#8217;t astonishing that X or Y improves sleep. The strength improvement, however, astonished me.</p>
<p>When I was standing on one bent leg to improve my sleep, I knew that if I did the exercise every other day instead of every day, my legs would get stronger &#8212; much stronger. I didn&#8217;t want that. I wanted to sleep well every night (that was the reason for the exercise) and I didn&#8217;t want the exercise to take too long. (To improve sleep, I am pretty sure the exercise must be done to exhaustion.)  When he started lifting in June, apparently Nile did not realize that he would get better results &#8212; become stronger faster &#8212; if he lifted weights every other day instead of every day. The strength increase, it appears, happens whether you want it  (Nile) or not (me).</p>
<p>Niles added later:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am now certain that it is easier for me to go up and down stairs. When I first started lifting these weights, both in June and when I started again in November, I had a lot of &#8220;popping&#8221; and &#8220;cracking&#8221; in my shoulder and elbow joints. That has all but disappeared. I have definitely added muscle.  My lifts show it and I have gained 3 or 4 pounds.</p>
<p>It took me awhile to feel the effects of the honey both in lifts and in sleep.  I didn’t notice any differences in lifts until about 11 days and I didn’t notice any difference in sleep until 2 weeks or more. About half the nights my sleep is heavier or deeper [than before honey].  I’m not sure of the correct adjective but when it happens it seems clear.  On those nights I have deep sleep I don’t take a nap the next day.  I don’t wake up feeling “refreshed” as others have reported but I am not a morning person and it takes me awhile to wake up and get going. I am more productive the day after one of these deep sleeps.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am on an Ancestral Health Society (AHS) steering committee. After the first symposium, some members of the committee wanted to make recommendations about how to eat. I argued against this, saying it was too early to be sure. No paleo theorist, as far as I know, has said that sweets have value, but at the same time, the honey effect supports the practical value of evolutionary thinking, the rationale for AHS. A big reason I believed the effect of honey on sleep was very important is that it provided an evolutionary explanation of dessert. Another big reason was my sudden strength improvement. Repetition of the sudden improvement suggests that evolutionary thinking pushed me in the right direction.</p>
<p>So bedtime honey doesn&#8217;t just improve sleep, it also increases muscle growth &#8212; a lot. I wonder how to test its effect on memory. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/20/bedtime-honey-improves-sleep-1000-crazy-good-tip/" target="_blank">Jason DeFillippio of Grumpy Old Geeks</a> said, &#8220;My memory has really improved&#8221;. A reader named Crystal made <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/05/honey-at-bedtime-improves-sleep/#comment-1158414" target="_blank">the astute comment</a> that the impact of a sugar-containing food (honey) on growth would explain why children like sweets so much, something that has never been well explained.</p>
<p>Nile&#8217;s experience impresses me not just because of the strength increase but also because the effect of the honey increased over a few weeks (&#8220;It took me awhile to feel the effects of the honey both in lifts and in sleep&#8221;). Maybe the honey caused healing. Some healing processes take years. Maybe bedtime honey speeds them up. The long-term benefits may be more than sleep and strength.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/health/risk-calculator-for-cholesterol-appears-flawed.html" target="_blank">A <em>New York Times</em> article about error in a risk calculator</a> paints an unflattering picture of doctors:</p>
<p>1. The risk calculator supposedly tells you your risk of a heart attack, to help you decide if you should take statins. It overestimates risk by about 100%. The doctors in charge of it were told about the error a year ago. They failed to fix the problem.</p>
<p>2. The doctors in charge of the risk calculator are having trouble figuring out how to respond. The possibility of a simple retraction seems to not have occurred to them. As one commenter said, &#8220;That the researchers, once confronted with the evidence it was faulty, struggled with how to handle the issue is quite telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. In the comments, a retired doctor thinks the problem of causation of heart disease is very simple:</p>
<blockquote><p>Statins . . . are only one component in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease. Item number one is to have a normal weight. Item two is never smoke. Item three is exercise. Four is to eat an intelligent diet. Five is to remove stress from your life as much as practical. If everybody did these five things (all of which are free), the incidence of coronary artery disease would plummet and many fewer would need statins.</p></blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of a doctor who told me she knew why people are fat: <em>They eat too much and exercise too little</em>. She was sure.</p>
<p>4. In the comments, a former medical writer writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several years ago, I wrote up, as internal reports, about two dozen transcripts recorded at meetings with local doctors that a major drug company held all around the country. The meetings concerned its statin. Two ideas presented at these meetings by the marketing team, and agreed with by the physician attendees, were: 1) the muscle pain reported by patients was almost never caused by the statin but was the result of excessive gardening, golfing, etc; 2) many children should be prescribed a statin and told that they would have to take the drug for life.</p></blockquote>
<p>5. Another doctor, in the comments, says something perfectly reasonable, but even her comment makes doctors look bad:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a physician and I took statins for 2 years. Within the first 6 months, I developed five new serious medical problems, resulting in thousands of dollars spent on treatments, diagnostic tests, more prescription medications, and lost work. Neither I nor any of my 6 or 7 different specialists thought to suspect the statin as the source of my problems. I finally figured it out on my own. It took 3 more years for me to get back to my baseline state of health. I had been poisoned. I see this all the time now in my practice of dermatology. Elderly patients are on statins and feel lousy, some of whom are also on Alzheimer’s drugs, antidepressants, Neurontin for chronic pain, steroids for fibromyalgia. These poor people have their symptoms written off as “getting older” by their primary physicians, most of whom I imagine are harried but well intentioned, trying to follow guidelines such as these, and so focused on treating the numbers that they fail to see the person sitting in front of them. The new guidelines, with their de-emphasis on cholesterol targets, seem to tacitly acknowledge that cholesterol lowering has little to do with the beneficial actions of statins. The cholesterol hypothesis is dying. If statins “work” by exerting anti-inflammatory benefits, then perhaps we should seek safer alternative ways to accomplish this, without subjecting patients to metabolic derangement.</p></blockquote>
<p>6. A patient:</p>
<blockquote><p>My previous doctor saw an ultrasound of my Carotid Artery with a very small buildup and told me I needed to take crestor to make it go away. That was four years ago and I still suffer from some memory loss episodes as a result. The experience was terrible and he&#8217;s toast because he denied it could happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>7. A bystander:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the past couple of years my job has involved working with academic physicians at a major medical school. After watching them in action &#8212; more concerned with personal reputation, funding and internecine politics than with patients &#8212; it&#8217;s a wonder any of us are limping along. And their Mickey Mouse labs and admin organizations can barely organize the annual staff holiday potluck without confusion and strife. So these botched-up results don&#8217;t surprise me at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not leaving out stuff that makes doctors look good. Maybe this is a biassed picture, maybe not. What I find curious is the wide range of bad behavior. I cannot explain it. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444709004577652201640230514" target="_blank">Marty Makary argued</a> that doctors behave badly due to lack of accountability but that doesn&#8217;t easily explain ignoring a big error when pointed out (#1), an immature response (#2), a simplistic view of heart disease (#3), extraordinary callousness (#4) and so on.  In her last book (<em>Dark Age Ahead</em>), Jane Jacobs wrote about failure of learned professions (such as doctors) to police themselves. Again, however, I don&#8217;t see why better policing would improve the situation.</p>
