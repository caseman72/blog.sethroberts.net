<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That’s what makes medicine such an effective academic discipline.</p>
<p>By &#8220;that&#8221; he meant certain methodologies, especially randomized experiments. I disagree with this assessment. My opinion is that health care is in a state of profound stagnation, unable to make much progress on major problems.</p>
<p>Here are six signs of the stagnation in health care (by which I mean everything related to health):</p>

				<small>Monday, May 9th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1044471/Meat-consumption-and-weight-gain.html">This article by Eoin O&#8217;Connell</a> reports <a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/92/2/398.abstract">a study in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em></a> (the top nutrition journal) that found a correlation between meat consumption and weight gain: The more meat you ate, the more weight you gained over five years. <em>Meat is fattening! </em>reported several newspapers.</p>
<p>Mr. O&#8217;Connell did something unusual for a health journalist: He thought for himself. I don&#8217;t mean he applied a formulaic criticism (e.g., &#8220;correlation does not equal causation&#8221;). That&#8217;s not thinking, that&#8217;s knee-jerking. Mr. O&#8217;Connell read the paper. And he noticed an interaction: The correlation between meat consumption and weight gain depended on activity level. The study involved about 400,000 people. The researchers put each person in one of four activity levels: inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, and active. There was a correlation between red-meat consumption and weight only for the two most active groups (moderately active and active). The original article reported that this interaction was significant:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The relation between red meat                      and weight gain was also stronger in physically  active subjects compared with moderately inactive or inactive subjects (<em>P</em> values for interaction = 0.02)</p>
<p>The obvious implication of this interaction, as Mr. O&#8217;Connell says, is that meat caused muscle gain. Weight differences between more-meat and less-meat eaters were due to differences in muscle mass. This puts an entirely different spin on the results. The alternative explanation is quite plausible. I once had a grad student who was a vegetarian. When he was an undergrad, he told me, he and his roommate would go to the weight room and do similar sets. His roommate, who ate meat, rapidly gained muscle; he did not. Of course, meat = animal muscle.</p>
<p>Mr. O&#8217;Connell continued to the really interesting part of his article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Perhaps not so surprisingly, the consideration that muscle is a form of  weight gain does not appear in the newspaper articles but much more  surprising is the fact that it does not appear in the original journal  article either.</p>
<p>The <em>AJCN </em>article has <strong>fifty authors</strong>. Not one of them, apparently, noticed this all-important point! Nor did the reviewers for this prestigious journal. The article concludes: &#8220;Our results                      are therefore in favor of the public health  recommendation to decrease meat consumption for health improvement.&#8221; No, they&#8217;re not, if the <em>more meat, more muscle</em> explanation is correct.</p>
<p>Most prestigious journal. Fifty authors. Huge expense. Total F-up in the sense that the final conclusion is probably wrong. (To be fair, the paper has plenty of value in other ways.) Congratulations, Mr. O&#8217;Connell, for noticing.</p>

					<p>You have surely heard the phrase <em>economies of scale</em> &#8212; meaning that when you make many copies of something each instance costs less than when you make only a few copies. Large companies are said to benefit from &#8220;economies of scale&#8221; &#8212; so there is pressure to become bigger.

					<p>The notion that high cholesterol (more specifically, high &#8220;bad&#8221; &#8212; LDL &#8212; cholesterol)  causes heart disease may be as widely accepted as the notion that humans have caused dangerous global warming. It is much easier to test, however. <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/113/3/427">An excellent study published in 2006</a> compared two groups of people at risk for heart disease: those given a high dose of statins and those given a low dose. The high dose reducd LDL cholesterol levels; as it was meant to; the low dose did not. But there was <strong>no effect</strong> on coronary heart disease progression. After a year of statins, persons in both groups had increased their coronary artery calcification score by the same amount &#8212; about 25%. Totally contradicting the cholesterol hypothesis.</p>
<p>Regular readers of this blog may remember that after a year of eating butter (half a stick per day), <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/28/new-heart-scan-results-good-news/">my coronary artery calcification score <strong>decreased</strong> 24%</a>. Because increases of about 25% are the norm, my score was about 50% less than expected. Decreases are very rare, I was told.</p>

					<p><a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/rethinking-normal-blood-pressure/?hp#comment-657310">Apparently not</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was a very naughty patient and, after taking Atacand for 135/75  blood pressure (benign essential hypertension was the description) for a  number of years on my doctorâ€™s prescription, decided to do a little  experiment. That is, I cut back on it gradually, monitoring my BP every  day. No change.</p>
<p>I eventually got to no Atacand at all and have been there for the  past four years, during which time the BP has remained the same as when  taking the drug.  Now, whether the BP is going to kill me is perhaps a  separate question (I seem to be in excellent health at 65) but the  Atacand doesnâ€™t appear to have made much difference at all â€” except for  the $600/year it cost me, even after insurance had picked up on some of  the expense.</p></blockquote>
<p>I began to grasp how helpful self-experimentation could be when I discovered that tetracycline, an antibiotic that my dermatologist had prescribed, did not reduce my acne. When I told my dermatologist about the research that revealed this, he said, &#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Had this person&#8217;s doctor told him that Atacand might not work? Clearly not. Did the doctor even <strong>know </strong>that Atacand might not work? Apparently not, since there was no doctor-guided attempt to find out. Perhaps the doctor who prescribed Atacand would defend himself by saying, lamely, that all he knew is what the drug company told him. I wonder what the drug company knew.</p>
<p>How much money could be saved by stopping the prescription of drugs that turn out not to work? Should all drugs come with a label that says <strong>the fraction of patients for whom this drug doesn&#8217;t work</strong>? It is a warning that is truly needed.</p>

					<p>My friends know I like examples. My mother has complained I like them too much. Here, <a href="http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/003429.html">via Jonathan Schwarz</a>, is a good example of why I like examples. From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Wikileaks-t.html">a long article by Bill Keller</a>, executive editor of the <em>New York Times</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m the first to admit that news organizations, including this one, sometimes get things wrong. We can be overly credulous (as in some of the prewar reporting about Iraq&#8217;s supposed weapons of mass destruction) or <strong>overly cynical about official claims and motives</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added. The lack of an example of being &#8220;overly cynical about official claims and motives&#8221; speaks volumes about the <em>New York Times&#8217;</em> relationship to those in power.</p>

				<small>Saturday, November 27th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/hope-of-liberation-portraits-of-ms-therapy-patients/article1815108/">This story from the <em>Globe and Mail</em></a> describes what happened to ten Canadians who left the country to get liberation therapy for their multiple sclerosis (MS). The therapy consists of widening veins that drain blood from the brain. The therapy does not always work, but it usually does. The improvement is so fast and large &#8212; comparable to giving someone with scurvy Vitamin C &#8212; that the thing being changed must be the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Mainstream MS researchers missed this completely. The mainstream view is that MS is an auto-immune disease (e.g., <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/DS00188/DSECTION=causes">according to Mayo Clinic staff</a>). This view would never lead you to the liberation surgery. Doctors not only have the wrong idea, they are unwilling to defend it. A woman in the <em>Globe and Mail</em> story tried to get the anti-liberation argument from neurologists. She couldn&#8217;t:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately the neurologists are all hysterical. You can&#8217;t talk to them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember this the next time someone tells you that ulcers are not caused by stress but are actually caused by bacteria &#8212; as several contributors to <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/thaler10/thaler10_index.html">this EDGE symposium</a> claim.</p>
<p>The vast improvement in understanding of MS came about because someone with the necessary expertise (a professor of surgery) cared more than most MS researchers because his wife had MS. I think this is why my self-experimentation found such different solutions than mainstream science: because (a) I cared more than the professional researchers who studied the subject (e.g., sleep) and (b) I had the necessary expertise to do research. I discuss this <a href="http://www.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>

				<small>Friday, November 26th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>&#8230; is the title of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/magazine/21Epilepsy-t.html">a <em>New York Times Magazine </em>article</a> about the ketogenic diet, a treatment for childhood epilepsy, which I&#8217;ve blogged about several times (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/10/the-ketogenic-diet/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/15/the-ketogenic-diet-and-evidence-snobs/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/30/the-ketogenic-diet-continued/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/01/24/animal-fat-sleep-and-the-ketogenic-diet/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/06/12/goes-against-everything-i-was-taught-in-med-school/">here</a>). It&#8217;s a very-high-fat diet. It interests me for two reasons: (a) It connects a high-fat diet with proper brain function, as my self-experiments have done. A curious feature of the ketogenic diet is that it isn&#8217;t permanent. After several years the child can go off it. My self-experimentation suggests that Americans eat far too little of certain fats. Perhaps eating enough of these fats would prevent childhood epilepsy. (b) It shows how someone who cares enough &#8212; in this case, Jim Abrahams, whose son had epilepsy &#8212; can be more effective than professional researchers and doctors. Abrahams rediscovered the diet. He saw its value, the professionals didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve argued that this is part of why my self-experimentation found new solutions to common problems: because I had those problems. I cared more about finding a workable solution than researchers in those areas, who had several other concerns (publication, funding, acceptance, etc.).</p>
<p>The details of the article reminded me of something I learned in the BBC series <em>The Story of Science</em>. For hundreds of years, medical students were told, following Aristotle, that the liver has three lobes. It doesn&#8217;t. You might think that examination of thousands of actual livers would have dispelled the wrong idea, but it didn&#8217;t. The article contains many examples of doctors ignoring perfectly good evidence in favor of nonsense they read in a book or heard in a lecture. Epilepsy is easy to measure. If a child has 100 seizures per day, and has been having them at this rate for years, and this goes down to 5 shortly after he starts the ketogenic diet, and goes up again when the child goes off the diet, there is no doubt the diet works. As early as the 1930s, this had been observed hundreds of times. This was overwhelming evidence of effectiveness. Doctors ignored it, probably based on the modern equivalent of the three-lobed liver. They complained, according to the article, that there was &#8220;no evidence it worked&#8221; or that the evidence wasn&#8217;t &#8220;controlled&#8221; or &#8220;scientific&#8221; (whatever that means). A study published in 2008 &#8220;answered doubts about keto&#8217;s clinical effectiveness&#8221; &#8212; as if doctors needed the equivalent of a very-large-type book to be able to read what most of us can read with normal-sized type.</p>
<p>According to the article, &#8220;by 2000, more people were asking about keto, but most pediatric neurologists still would not prescribe it&#8221; &#8212; as if the parents needed the approval of their doctor to try it. You don&#8217;t need a prescription to buy food.</p>

					<p>At Tsinghua I am teaching a class called Frontiers of Psychology. The students are reading <a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/JMichael-Bailey/TMWWBQ.pdf"><em>The Man Who Would Be Queen</em></a> by Michael Bailey. At one point Bailey mentions what is sometimes called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternal_birth_order_and_male_sexual_orientation"><em>the older brother effect</em></a>: If a man has one older brother, he is more likely to be gay than if he has no older brothers, controlling for several things. This has been seen many times. In 1962 it was reported that gay men have more older siblings than other men but not until 1996 was it determined that this was due to more older brothers.</p>
<p>Bailey doesn&#8217;t mention the strength of the effect. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds"><em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em></a> by James Surowiecki is about research that found that non-experts can do an excellent job of estimating this or that number (such as the weight of a particular cow) even when they know little about it. Their answers are excellent in the sense that the average of their answers is very accurate. Perhaps my students, who had read two-thirds of Bailey&#8217;s book, could accurately estimate the strength of the effect.</p>
<p>I posed the question like this. Suppose that when a man has no older brothers, his chance of being gay is 2.0%. What is his chance of being gay if he has one older brother? I gathered an estimate from every student. The median of their estimates was 8%. The correct answer is 2.7%.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, September 21st, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Tim Lundeen writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We [Tim and his partner, Alexandra] first noticed that eating avocados raised our blood glucose when we were on a low-protein/low-fat/high-fruit nutrition plan. After 1/4 avocado each, we would both have fasting glucose of 95-99 instead of 80-85, with the effect lasting for about 4 days. It was quite repeatable, so we stopped eating avocados. We speculated at the time that it was due to the omega-6 content of the avocado fat.</p>
<div>We just tried avocado again with more typical nutrition, with about 25% protein, 25% fat, 50% carbohydrate with very low fructose, thinking that because we were eating more fat the effect might not be so pronounced, but saw the same elevated fasting blood glucose as before.</div>
<p>After some more research, we found out it isÂ because avocados contain a sugar called mannoheptulose, which causes temporary dysregulation of blood sugar.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Mannoheptulose was first isolated in 1917. Mannoheptulose has been proven to be present in many foods, but is found most abundantly in the avocado (La Forge 1916-1917). In 1957, the first research was published in the Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics (Volume 69, page 592), suggesting that avocado extract blocked normal insulin secretion. In 1963, it was demonstrated that avocado extract blocks glucose-stimulated release of insulin (Nature, Volume 197, page 1264). By 1967, low doses of avocado extract were found to inhibit both pancreatic secretion and synthesis of insulin without eliciting measurable hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) (Nature, Volume 214, page 276). This finding was significant because it demonstrated that a controlled dose of avocado extract could suppress pancreatic production of insulin without inducing a diabetic state. [<a href="http://www.health-marketplace.com/p-Obesity-3.htm" target="_blank">http://www.health-marketplace.com/p-Obesity-3.htm</a>]<br />
The problem with this is that your cells don&#8217;t absorb nutrition because insulin is reduced, so we have strong cravings for food, feel extra hungry all the time, and have been eating about 50% more calories to feel full. The net effect is not a good feeling&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes sense. And it is methodologically interesting. Spending zero research dollars, Tim and Alexandra learned something important about blood sugar control that the rest of the world seems not to know. (Except perhaps the researchers who did the avocado extract research.) None of the research articles they mention make clear the practical significance of the effect. To say that avocado extract does X doesn&#8217;t tell you how much avocado you need to get the effect.</p>
<p>When I google &#8220;avocado&#8221; and &#8220;blood sugar&#8221; (together), the first page of links all claim, at least at first glance, that avocado <strong>lowers</strong> blood sugar. But that&#8217;s just the internet. (Although Google is supposed to put the most reliable links at the top.) Then I went to the most authoritative possible source on what we should eat: the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em>. I found only three articles that mention avocados in their title or abstract. None was about this effect. I also looked in <em>Eat Drink and Be Healthy </em>by Walter Willett and the Harvard School of Public Health. Nothing about this effect of avocado.</p>

					<p>The <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> website has a blog about &#8220;ideas, culture, and the arts [that] features some of the best minds in academic and policy circles&#8221;. One of the bloggers &#8212; Gina Barreca, a professor of English and Feminist Theory at the University of Connecticut and <a href="http://www.ginabarreca.com/">a humorist</a> &#8212; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Why-College-Professors-Dont/8765/">wrote about being older than her students</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think about the fact that my students and I no longer listen to same  music or revere the same actors; I wonder about the implications of the  fact that even some of the smart ones like <em>I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I pointed this out to Tucker Max (author of <em>I Hope . . . </em>). He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I like how she implies that some of her students are stupid. Great prof.</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought that was a great point. I asked if I could use it on this blog. He agreed, and added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other thing about her statement is that she implicitly scoffs at the notion that someone smart could&#8211;gasp&#8211;DISAGREE with her. It doesn&#8217;t even occur to her that she might be wrong, that her worldview might be the one that needs examining. To her, nothing legitimate can exist outside of her prejudices and opinions. Even the idea that it could is rejected out of hand.</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, she hasn&#8217;t read your book but it must be ridiculous. Of course. I  praised the film <em>Gladiator </em>(pre-Oscar) to someone I knew and she said,  to a friend, that this made me an inferior person. Because <em>Gladiator </em>was  popular, it must be bad. If I liked it, there was something wrong with  me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tucker replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Exactly&#8211;the idea that THEY might be wrong doesn&#8217;t even occur to them. Like it&#8217;s not even in the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>These are the same people that Nassim Taleb rails against, and the same people who read Socrates, and completely miss the point, but still praise it because they think they&#8217;re supposed to. And these are the people that the internet/the age of connectivity is destroying. Because you can&#8217;t hide behind status anymore. Results are measurable, and everyone is on the playing field now.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree.</p>

				<small>Friday, August 6th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Gary Taubes pointed to <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/06/04/1003187107.short?rss=1&#038;ssource=mfc">this PNAS paper</a> about climate change and noted that one of the authors, Stephen Schneider, had a big non-financial conflict of interest: If it turns out the whole argument is wrong, he looks like a fool. The accompanying statement (&#8220;The authors declare no conflict of interest&#8221;) is, if taken to mean the authors have no conflict of interest, wildly inaccurate. Readers unaware of Schneider&#8217;s history wouldn&#8217;t know this.</p>
<p>I came across a similar example today. A reader of this blog wrote extensive criticisms (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/05/24/autism-and-prenatal-ultrasound-more/#comment-479976">here</a> and <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/05/24/autism-and-prenatal-ultrasound-more/#comment-480247">here</a>) of the idea that <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/05/24/autism-and-prenatal-ultrasound-more/">prenatal ultrasound may cause autism</a>. He believed Caroline Rodgers, my source for that idea, misrepresented the evidence. In particular, Rodgers pointed to a study that found ultrasound disturbed neuronal migration in mouse fetuses. She said it supported her idea. The reader disagreed, saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>The bottom line for me is that Dr. Rakic (from the mouse study)  clarified, â€œOur study in mice does not mean that use of ultrasound on  human fetuses for appropriate diagnostic and medical purposes should be  abandoned. Instead, our study warns against its non-medical use.â€ Yes.  Okay. No more boutiquey, keepsake ultrasounds. Great. But for Rodgers to  skew this data (along with the FDAâ€™s and othersâ€™) into claiming that  ultrasounds under the care of an Obstetrics professional (and for  medical use) are causing autism is disingenuous at best, unethical  propaganda for the Midwifery Way at worst.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reader is a professor who teaches composition. Maybe an English professor.Â  He or she takes Rakic seriously, where I completely ignore his statement because of a conflict of interest. If Rakic questions &#8220;appropriate&#8221; ultrasound, he will be attacked in many ways, making his life unpleasant. I have no idea whether this swayed Rakic, but he would be only human if it did.</p>
<p>Of course developing neurons are unable to distinguish appropriate and inappropriate ultrasound. Rakic&#8217;s statement is ridiculous as Rakic and all insiders (neuroscientists) know, I believe. All insiders know that there are dozens of examples where findings from mouse brains have turned out to be true for human brains, in spite of the many differences between them, and that there are thousands of grant proposals in which mouse brains are claimed to be a worthwhile model for human brains. All insiders know this, realize the pressure on Rakic to say what he said, and, like me, just ignore it. As far as I can tell, Rakic pays no price for misleading outsiders because the outsiders don&#8217;t know they are being misled. (Just as with political lobbying: the public doesn&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s happening.) The composition professor doesn&#8217;t know this, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Rodgers is not claiming that ultrasounds &#8220;are causing autism&#8221;. She is saying they might cause autism, that there are several reasons to think so, and therefore (a) the ultrasound-autism idea deserves further scrutiny and (b) ultrasounds should be avoided as much as possible until more is known.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/saskatchewans-wall-vows-to-fund-contentious-ms-treatment/article1653519/">How strange</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n a striking departure from his  political counterparts across the country, Saskatchewan Premier Brad  Wall says his government will finance clinical trials of liberation  therapy, a contentious experimental procedure for multiple sclerosis patients.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the heads of provinces don&#8217;t usually get involved in research at this level of detail. However, &#8220;Saskatchewan has the highest rate of MS in the country,&#8221; says the article.</p>
<p>In Part 5 of <em>The Story of Science</em> (BBC), Michael Mosley, the presenter, said that for hundreds of years medical students were shown a human liver and told it had three lobes. They were told that because that&#8217;s what Galen had said. However, human livers do not have three lobes. As the students could see. Mosely is a doctor. &#8220;When I was a medical student,&#8221; said Mosley, &#8220;there was tremendous pressure to conform.&#8221; MS researchers have said for a long time that MS is an autoimmune disease. Could this have been as misleading as Galen&#8217;s description of the liver?<br />

					<p>Rereading <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/03/28/omega-3-and-dental-health/">an old post</a>, I found this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today I had my teeth cleaned and was told my gums were in excellent  shape, better than ever before [due to flaxseed oil]. They were less inflamed than usual.  â€œWhat causes inflammation?â€ I asked. â€œTartar,â€ I was told.</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that reddish gums are a great sign (so easy to see) that overall your body has too much inflammation, putting you at higher risk for many common diseases. (Perhaps due to too little omega-3, which the body uses to make an anti-inflammation hormone.) Every day my dentist measured, or at least saw, a great correlate of health (the redness of his patients&#8217; gums) and failed to notice. It&#8217;s like failing to notice an oil field under your property. If dentists became experts in measuring gum redness and helped their patients lower overall inflammation, the public health contribution would be great. (Writing this makes me wonder why <strong>I</strong> haven&#8217;t become skilled at measuring the redness of <strong>my </strong>gums.)<br />
Experimental psychologists are in a similar position. I believe brain health is closely correlated with health of the rest of the body. In other words, the foods that make the brain work better make the rest of the body work better. I discovered the anti-inflammatory effects of flaxseed oil because it improved my balance. The brain is much easier to study (via behavior) than the rest of the body &#8212; it&#8217;s a model system for the rest of the body. Experimental psychologists are as unaware of their good fortune as dentists. By using their skills to figure out how to have the healthiest possible brain, they could make a great contribution to human welfare.</p>

					<p>Nassim Taleb has honed <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2010/06/god-cameron-detractors">his replies to common questions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Why did economists get the crisis so wrong?</strong><br />
That&#8217;s  like asking why fortune-tellers don&#8217;t get things right. Their tools  don&#8217;t work, but they continue to use them. And the Nobel committee gives  prizes to people who aren&#8217;t scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is what I&#8217;m saying about geneticists &#8212; <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/12/22/modern-biology-cargo-cult-science-continued/">their tools don&#8217;t work</a> (also <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/06/13/the-dreams-of-geneticists/">here</a>) and <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/10/28/too-big-to-fail/">the Nobel committee fails to notice</a> (e.g., the recent award for teleomere research, which hasn&#8217;t yet had practical value).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>You have a great  phrase in <em>The Black Swan</em>: &#8220;Don&#8217;t drive a school bus  blindfolded.&#8221; Is that still happening?</strong><br />
Worse. I was talking  about Bernanke &#8211; they&#8217;ve given him a bigger bus.</p></blockquote>

					<p>Jonathan Cole used to be provost of Colombia University. He has written a book called T<em>he Great American University</em>, in which, according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/books/review/Goldin-t.html?ref=books">this review</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>He lists their dazzling achievements, which in biology and medicine include findings on gene-splicing, recombinant DNA, retroviruses, cancer therapies, cochÂ­lear implants, the fetal ultrasound scanner, the hepatitis B vaccine, prions, <a title="Recent and archival health news about stem cells." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/stemcells/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">stem cells</a>, organ transplantation and even a treatment for head lice. . . . In a chapter on the social sciences, he cites, among many others, such useful innovations as theories of human capital and social mobility, research in linguistics and even the use of prices to reduce traffic jams.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Research in linguistics&#8221;? Yes, that sounds dazzling. I&#8217;m sure those &#8220;theories of human capital&#8221; have been v v &#8220;useful&#8221;. And who would have thought that if you raise the price of something (&#8220;use of prices to reduce traffic jams&#8221;) . . . people use less of it? Which was traffic engineering, not social science. Did the reviewer, an economics professor at Harvard named Claudia Goldin, write this with a straight face?</p>
<p>The &#8220;dazzling achievements&#8221; in biology and medicine are only slightly less unconvincing.&#8221;Gene splicing&#8221; and &#8220;recombinant DNA&#8221; research are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering">different names for the same thing</a>. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/01/23/does-prenatal-ultrasound-cause-autism/">Fetal ultrasound scanners may cause autism</a>. Vaccines were not invented by an American university professor. The discovery of prions has had no obvious non-laboratory use &#8212; besides being questionable. Stem-cell research has yet to produce anything of use outside of labs. To be fair, gene splicing has been used to produce human insulin, which is better than the insulin previously available, but conspicuously absent from the list of accomplishments is prevention of diabetes &#8212; not to mention allergies, obesity, depression, arthritis, stroke, or any of the other lifestyle problems that a large fraction of Americans suffer from. Such achievements would be truly useful. Great American universities haven&#8217;t given us any of those . . but they have given us a treatment for head lice.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason for the term <em>ivory tower</em>. Apparently Cole, conscious of the term, is trying to argue against it &#8212; but merely shows why it exists. (I&#8217;m assuming the review is accurate.)  It reminds me of the time that top Chinese students, visiting top American colleges such as Harvard and Yale, found the American students <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/12/10/when-is-science-helpful/">ignorant and arrogant</a>. The theme of Cole&#8217;s book is that American universities are in trouble and need more support. What useful stuff they&#8217;ve accomplished is central to his argument. When I was an undergrad, I read Thorstein Veblen&#8217;s bitter <em>The Higher Learning in America</em>, which said American universities were dysfunctional. He mentioned &#8220;committees for the sifting of sawdust.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>More </strong><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Big-Lie-About-the-Life-of/63937/">&#8220;Graduate school in the humanities is a trap&#8221;</a> (via <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/02/assorted-links-8.html">Marginal Revolution</a>).</p>
