				<small>Friday, October 12th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>As usual, there is plenty of disease and disability in the world: depression, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke, obesity, autoimmune disease, and so on. As usual, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &#8212; supposed to be given for the most useful research &#8212; is given for research with no proven benefit to anyone (except career-wise). Once again implying that the world&#8217;s best biomedical researchers &#8212; judging by who wins Nobel Prizes &#8212; either don&#8217;t want to or don&#8217;t know how to do useful research.</p>
<p>Once again <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/press.html">the press release</a> tries to hide this. &#8220;From surprising discovery to medical use&#8221; reads one heading. If you read the text, however, you learn there is no actual &#8220;medical use&#8221;. Here&#8217;s what it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>These discoveries have also provided new tools for scientists around the world and led to remarkable progress in many areas of medicine. iPS cells can also be prepared from human cells. For instance, skin cells can be obtained from patients with various diseases, reprogrammed, and examined in the laboratory to determine how they differ from cells of healthy individuals. Such cells constitute invaluable tools for understanding disease mechanisms and so provide new opportunities to develop medical therapies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently you can make &#8220;remarkable progress&#8221; in medicine without helping a single person, which says a lot about what passes for medical progress. Although iPS cells are supposedly &#8220;invaluable tools&#8221; for understanding disease mechanisms, we are not told a single disease that has thereby been understood or a single therapy that has been developed.</p>
<p><em>The Guardian</em> printed <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/oct/08/nobel-prize-2012-live-medicine-physiology">a roundup of responses</a> to the award. I read it eagerly. Maybe one of the comments will explain how the prize-winning work actually helped someone (besides career-wise). After all, Yamanaka, one of the winners, had previously won the Finland Prize, given to research that &#8220;significantly improves the quality of human life today and for future generations&#8221;. Paul Nurse says the prize-winning work did such-and-such, &#8220;paving the way for important developments in the diagnosis and treatment of disease&#8221; unfortunately not saying what those &#8220;important developments&#8221; are. Martin Evans says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The practical outcome is that now we not only know that it might be theoretically possible to convert one cell type into another but it is also practically possible. These are very important foundation studies for <strong>future</strong> cellular therapies in medicine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added. Another comment: &#8220;These breakthroughs <strong>will</strong> ultimately lead to new and better treatments for conditions like Parkinson’s and improve the lives of millions of people around the world.&#8221; A bold prediction, given that they have not yet improved the life of even one person. Julian Savescu, an ethicist at Oxford, says &#8220;This is as significant as the discovery of antibiotics. Given the millions, or more lives, which could be saved, this is a truly momentous award.&#8221;</p>
<p>Year after year, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is given for research that, we are told by biologists with huge conflicts of interest, will &#8212; no doubt! &#8212; be incredibly valuable in the future. Indicating there was no research that might be honored that had already been useful. It is as if you have a baseball award for best hitter but all hitters all over the world strike out all the time so you end up giving the award to people who strike out best. <em>They are the best hitters</em>, you tell credulous sportswriters. They receive the prestigious award for best hitter at an elaborate ceremony, with toasts all around. Nobody says they cannot hit.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, August 1st, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A week ago I had my teeth cleaned. <em>So dirty!</em> said the dental hygienist. This wasn&#8217;t surprising. Because I am in China a lot, I get my teeth cleaned only twice per year. Long ago they got dirty so fast my dentist insisted on four cleanings per year. &#8220;But aren&#8217;t my gums okay?&#8221; I asked the hygienist. They felt okay. Not tender. They did&#8217;t bleed when I flossed (which wasn&#8217;t often). <em>No</em>, she said. <em>You have pockets of 5</em> (= 5 mm depth). <em>There is bleeding.</em> Indeed, when I washed out my mouth with water at the end, there was some blood.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had my teeth examined. The hygienist was wrong. Almost all my pockets were 2&#8242;s, with a few 3s. That&#8217;s very good and a vast improvement from the 4s and 5s I had before I became a big fan of flaxseed oil. My gums improved exactly when I started drinking flaxseed oil, no doubt because the omega-3 in flaxseed oil reduces inflammation. My gums were fine in spite of all the plaque &#8212; which is supposed to make gums bad. Apparently the hygienist was so devoted to her theory (lots of plaque = bad gums) that she failed to see an exception she stared at for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>There is a well-established correlation between gum disease and heart disease (more gum disease, more heart disease), probably because both are caused by inflammation. So good gums is very good news &#8212; it shows I am doing a good job of reducing inflammation throughout my body. These results also support two of my pet theories:</p>
<p>1.<em> Studying what foods make the brain work best is a good way to improve overall health</em>. I started studying flaxseed oil, and how much to take, because I discovered by accident that it improved my balance. Experiments (what is the effect of flaxseed oil on my balance?) soon showed the optimum amount/day was more than flaxseed oil makers recommended! Before I started eating lots of butter, the optimum for me was about 3 tablespoons/day. After I started eating lots of butter, the optimum seems to have gone down to 2 tablespoons/day. Gum improvement seems to be easy to notice at about 1 tablespoon/day.</p>
<p>2. <em>Our health care system fails to get the simplest things right</em>. Omega-3 is not a mysterious nutrient. It has been shown to improve health in thousands of studies. It is well-known that it is anti-inflammatory. It is also well-known that too much inflammation is a major problem. Even so, our health care system has failed to grasp that a large fraction of the population eats too little omega-3 and this has an easy fix. Other examples of failure to get the simplest things right include <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/07/31/mark-bittman-glimpses-a-big-truth/">gastroenterologists not realizing that digestive problems may be caused by food</a>, <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2005/09/15/seth-roberts-on-acne-guest-blog-pt-iv/">dermatologists not realizing that acne may be caused by food</a>, and everyone not realizing that <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html">cutting off part of the immune system (tonsillectomies) is a terrible idea</a>. </p>
<p>What other simple things does our health care system get wrong?</p>

				<small>Tuesday, June 12th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Scurvy is a disease of civilization because you need civilization to make long ocean voyages. It is the first disease of civilization to be understood and eliminated. In <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/p46128q5lgt85xpn/fulltext.pdf">a paper called &#8220;Innovation and Evaluation&#8221;</a> (gated), Frederick Mosteller, a professor of statistics at Harvard, noted how long it took. In 1601, James Lancaster, a sea captain, did an experiment involving four ships on a long voyage. Men on one ship got lemon juice, men on the other three ships did not. The men given lemon juice were far less likely to get scurvy.  In 1747, James Lind, a doctor, compared six purported cures for scurvy. Lemons and oranges (one cure) were much better than the other five (as Lind expected). In 1795 the British Navy started using citrus juice regularly and wiped out scurvy on their ships. In 1865, the British Board of Trade recommended citrus juice for commercial ships. It took more than 200 years for a simple and effective remedy &#8212; discovered before Lancaster &#8212; to spread widely.</p>
<p>The sailors at risk of scurvy did not control what they ate. The people who controlled what they ate never got scurvy. Sure, the people who controlled what sailors ate did not want them to get scurvy (high rates of scurvy were a big problem) but they also had other concerns. The lesson I draw from this story is <em>do not let <strong>anyone else</strong> (doctor, expert, etc.) solve your health problems for you</em>. Sure, other people, as part of their job, will sell you something, provide advice, write a prescription, provide therapy, do surgery, whatever. It might work. They <strong>want</strong> to help you &#8212; the more they help you, the better they look, the more business they attract. But it is entirely possible, this bit of history teaches, that they are slow on the uptake or have conflicts of interest and a much better solution is available.</p>

				<small>Monday, June 11th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/06/05/what-to-do-about-antibiotic-resistance-improve-immune-function/">a recent post</a> I made an obvious point. If our immune systems were stronger, we would need antibiotics less often and antibiotic resistance would become less of a problem. I hadn&#8217;t heard this point made (for example, <a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2012/9789241503181_eng.pdf">this WHO report</a> fails to say it). This was one example, I said, of how mainstream health care ignores the immune system. Perfectly obvious things, such as this idea about antibiotic resistance, fail to be noticed. I gave five more examples. Since then I have come across even more examples:</p>
<p>1. Hospitals do little to help patients sleep and often interrupt sleep, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/06/05/what-to-do-about-antibiotic-resistance-improve-immune-function/#comment-969914">Nancy Lebovitz pointed out</a> (better sleep &#8211;&gt; better immune function). <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/need-sleep-stay-out-of-the-hospital/">This article</a> describes the problem. One way to improve hospital sleep &#8212; beyond <strong>don&#8217;t wake patients up</strong> &#8212; would be to provide exposure to strong sunlight-like light in the morning and prevent exposure to sunlight-like light after dark. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I found that an hour of sunlight or similar light from fluorescent lamps in the morning improved my sleep</a>. Most fluorescent light resembles sunlight (both have strong bluish components), incandescent light (reddish) does not. Until they install dual lighting systems (bluish light during the day, reddish light at night), hospitals can provide blue-blocker glasses to wear after dark.</p>
<p>2. The book <a href="http://immortalbirdpostscript.wordpress.com/"><em>Immortal Bird</em></a> (sent me by the publisher) tells how Damon Weber, born with a defective heart, had a heart transplant when he was a teenager. After the transplant, problems arose. The doctors involved (at <a href="http://nyp.org/">NewYork-Presbyterian ­Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center</a>) took the problems to be signs of transplant rejection. In fact they were due to infection. Drugs given to deal with the mistakenly-assumed rejection suppressed Damon&#8217;s immune system. They reduced his ability to fight off the infection and he died. The author of the book, Damon&#8217;s father, sued the doctors and hospital for malpractice. The doctors did not exactly &#8220;ignore&#8221; the immune system, but they apparently failed to fully grasp the danger of immune suppression, even though the infection that killed Damon is common in transplant cases. (Although Columbia Presbyterian charged half a million dollars for the transplant, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/books/review/immortal-bird-doron-webers-lament-for-his-son.html?pagewanted=all">&#8220;three years into the lawsuit the [hospital's] medical director claimed Damon’s post-op records couldn’t be located</a>.&#8221;)</p>
<p>3. I asked a UCSF medical student what she&#8217;d been taught about the immune system. &#8220;We cover it!&#8221; she said. In a section called &#8220;Infectious Disease, Immunology, and Inflammation&#8221;. <em>What makes the immune system work better or worse</em>? I asked. &#8220;If you&#8217;re stressed out, it doesn&#8217;t work well,&#8221; she said. If you&#8217;re malnourished, like in Bangladesh. You need &#8220;nutrients and vitamins&#8221;. (A booklet I got telling me to take less antibiotics told me to &#8220;eat healthy&#8221;.) She also said the students get entire lectures on how to treat diseases so rare they might never be encountered. There is a whole section on genetics. Sure, they cover it. So superficially that they don&#8217;t remember the most basic idea: Better sleep &#8211;&gt; better immune function. I said our health care system is built around <strong>first, let them get sick</strong>. That&#8217;s right, she said. Ignoring the immune system is an excellent way to allow people to get sick.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://huntgatherlove.com/">Melissa McEwen</a> pointed out that proton pump inhibitors, such as Nexium, reduce the body&#8217;s ability to fight infection. They are prescribed for acid reflux and reduce how much acid the stomach makes. Because stomach acid kills bacteria, there should have been far more concern about their safety. &#8220;Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide [billions of prescriptions]. . . . The collective body of information overwhelmingly suggests an increased risk of infectious complications,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19786155">this article</a>. Because the drugs are so common, the damage is great and, because of more infection, not restricted to those who take them. It could have been avoided by research into treatments that do not harm the immune system.</p>

					<p><em>First do no harm</em> . . . As <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/03/21/robin-hanson-on-doctors/">Robin Hanson has said</a>, what does that mean? In contrast, the rule illustrated by this story, from Bryan Castañeda, who works for a Los Angeles law firm, is quite clear:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the old firm I used to work at, I was talking to one of the senior attorneys and the topic of medical malpractice cases came up. He said he avoids them. Why, I asked. He said &#8212; I&#8217;m paraphrasing here &#8212; &#8220;Because you won&#8217;t find a doctor who will testify against another doctor in open court. They may advise you in private, &#8216;Oh yeah, so-and-so definitely screwed up,&#8217; but you won&#8217;t get them to say that on the stand. They all protect each other.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Judging by this story, if your doctor makes a mistake, the only person who will suffer consequences is you. Thank heavens the rest of us <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/16/dr-eileen-consorti-and-patient-power/">have more power than ever before</a>.  <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e1069?etoc=">A recent survey of doctors</a> found that  &#8220;more than a 10th (11.3%) admitted to telling patients something that was not true.&#8221; The survey did not ask about lies of omission (when silence is misleading); unwillingness to testify that someone else made a mistake is that sort of lie. <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/when-doctors-dont-tell-the-truth/">The survey also showed</a> that doctors (at least, those who took the survey) have a self-serving interpretation of the<em></em> term <em>not true</em>. Although only about 10% said they had said something &#8220;that was not true&#8221; &#8212; meaning something that they knew wasn&#8217;t true &#8212; &#8220;more than half had described a patient’s prognosis more optimistically than warranted.&#8221; Apparently they consider such descriptions not instances of &#8220;not true&#8221;.</p>
<p>In <em>Systems of Survival</em>, Jane Jacobs described two moral systems (lists of rules/values): The guardian syndrome and the commercial syndrome. In certain areas of life (e.g., military), the guardian syndrome prevailed; in other areas (e.g., small business), the commercial syndrome prevailed. Loyalty (e.g., &#8220;never testify against a fellow doctor&#8221;) is a guardian value &#8212; indeed, the main guardian value. In contrast, honesty is the main commercial value. Jacobs said that the two syndromes corresponded to two ways of making a living: taking and trading. Doctors do not represent themselves as predatory (= taking). But, according to Jacobs, this sort of rule (&#8220;never testify against a fellow doctor&#8221;) puts them squarely in that camp.</p>
<p>I asked Jim Jacobs, one of Jane Jacobs&#8217;s sons, for comment. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Exactly right. Jane experienced this herself, unfortunately. It&#8217;s really a major problem. I see the very same behavior among medical researchers too.</p></blockquote>

					<p>Because I am in China, I want my new credit card sent here. After 45 minutes arranging this, my credit-card company asked me one last security question: What were the last four digits of the bank account used to pay my most recent bill? I told them. They said my answer was wrong. Huh?</p>
<p>I pay my credit card bills through Fidelity Investments (which is not a bank). I contacted them. I was routed to their BillPay department. The person who helped me, whose name I wish I had written down, said that he was as puzzled as I was. It was not clear at all why my answer was wrong. He suggested a conference call. He started a conference call with my credit-card company. Within a few minutes, he and the credit-card company representative figured out that there was a mistake in the number listed by the credit-card company. Their software had lost the last digit of my account number, so that if my account number had ended in 12345, their records would have showed 1234. (Yet the payment still went through.)</p>
<p>I was greatly relieved. &#8220;At least the problem had a solution!&#8221; I told the credit-card-company representative. Imagine not being able to control one&#8217;s money because of a software error. I was/am grateful to the Fidelity representative for quickly solving a problem that had nothing to do with Fidelity.</p>
<p>You might think that such heavily-used software would by now be free of bugs. But it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/12/28/the-legacy-of-steve-jobs/">a recent post</a> I said that Steve Jobs seemed to live in a very limited intellectual world. I gave <a href="http://www.livingdharma.org/Real.World.Buddhism/SteveJobs-Commencement.html">his Stanford graduation speech</a> as an example. Someone asked me to explain. Here is my explanation.</p>
<p>The speech shows no sign of having read a book. It shows no sign of any intellectual interest outside his job.</p>
<p>It makes the insanely self-centered point that &#8220;if I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>It shows no sign of learning from anyone else (except his calligraphy teacher, which hardly counts). It shows no sign of even having noticed anyone else &#8212; it is all Steve all the time. It mentions Stewart Brand, but only to comment about the Whole Earth Catalog.</p>
<p>It makes the banal point <em>what seemed like bad news was actually good news</em> (&#8220;it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me&#8221;).</p>
<p>It ends with a long string of banalities about death: &#8220;And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.&#8221; A high school student could have said that &#8212; at a funeral, perhaps.</p>
<p>This is from someone at the center of an enormous on-going revolution. I tried to find praise for it but all I found was that <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5827086/ukranian-defense-chief-plagiarizes-steve-jobs-graduation-speech">someone in the Ukrainian government had plagiarized it</a>.</p>

				<small>Saturday, December 31st, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A blog called <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/">Adventures in Nutritional Therapy</a> (started March 2011) is about what the author learned while trying to solve her health problems via nutrition and a few other things. She usually assumed her health problems were due to too much or too little of some nutrient. She puts it like this: &#8220;using mostly non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) supplements and treatments to address depression, brain fog, insomnia, migraines, hypothyroidism, restless legs, carpal tunnel syndrome, and a bunch of other annoyances.&#8221; In contrast to what &#8220;the American medical establishment&#8221; advises. Mostly it is nutritional self-experimentation about a wide range of health problems.</p>
<p>Interesting things I learned from the archives:</p>
<p>1. Question: Did Lance Armstrong take performance-enhancing drugs? I learned that LiveStrong (Armstrong&#8217;s site) is a content farm. Now answer that question again.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;If you return repeatedly to a conventional doctor with a problem they can’t solve, they will eventually suggest you need antidepressants.&#8221;</p>
<p>3.  &#8220;When I mentioned [to Dr. CFS] the mild success I’d had with zinc, he said it was in my mind: I wanted it to work and it did. When I pointed out that 70% of the things I tried didn’t work, he changed the subject. Dr. CFS’ lack of basic reasoning skills did nothing to rebuild my confidence in the health care system.&#8221; Quite right. I have had the same experience. Most things I tried failed. When something finally worked, it could hardly be a placebo effect. This line of reasoning has been difficult for some supposedly smart people to grasp.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/04/the-story-of-the-end-of-my-depression/">A list of things that helped her with depression</a>. &#8220;Quit gluten&#8221; is number one.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">Pepsi caused her to get acne</a>. Same here.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">100 mg/day of iron caused terrible acne</a> that persisted for weeks after she stopped taking the iron.</p>
<p>7. &#8220;<a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/08/abdominal-pain/">In September 2008</a> I started a journey that serves as a good example of the limits of the American health care system, where you can go through three months, 15 doctor visits, $7,000 in medical tests, three prescriptions and five over-the-counter medications trying to treat your abdominal pain, and after you lose ten pounds due to said pain, you are asked by the “specialists” if you have an eating disorder.&#8221; I agree. Also an example of the inability of people within the American health care system to see those limits.  If they recognized that people outside their belief system might have something valuable to contribute, apparently something awful would happen.</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/07/six-weeks-of-sciatica/">Acupuncture relieved her sciatica</a>, but not for long. &#8220;By the time I left [the acupuncturist's office] the pain was gone, but it crept back during my 30-minute drive home.&#8221;</p>
<p>9. Pointing out many wrongs does not equal a right. She praises <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/09/sugar-bitter-pill-video/">a talk by Robert Lustig</a> about evil fructose. I am quite sure that fructose (by itself) did not cause the obesity epidemic. For one thing, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I lost a lot of weight by drinking it</a>. (<a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">Here is an advanced discussion</a>.) In other words, being a good critic of other people&#8217;s work (as Lustig may be) doesn&#8217;t get you very far. I think it is hard for non-scientists (and even some scientists) to understand that all scientific work has dozens of &#8220;flaws&#8221;. Pointing out the flaws in this or that is little help, unless those flaws haven&#8217;t been noticed. What usually helps isn&#8217;t seeing flaws, it is seeing what can be learned.</p>
<p>10. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/06/headaches-and-migraines/">A list of what caused headaches and migraines</a>. One was MSG. Another was Vitamin D3, because it made her Vitamin B1 level too low.</p>
<p>She is a good writer. Mostly I found support for my beliefs: 1. Of the two aspects of self-experimentation (measure, change),  change is more powerful. She does little or no self-tracking  (= keeping records) as far as I could tell, yet has made a lot of progress. She has done a huge amount of trying different things. 2. Nutritional deficiencies cause a lot of problems. 3. Fermented food is overlooked. She never tries it, in spite of major digestive problems. She does try probiotics. 4.

					<p>In 1995, I visited my Swedish relatives. We argued about the Euro. They thought it was a good idea, I thought it had a serious weakness.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ME</strong> It ties together economies that are different.</p>
<p><strong>MY AUNT</strong> It reduces the chance of war in Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>You could say we were both right. There have been no wars between Eurozone countries (supporting my aunt) and the Eurozone is now on the verge of breaking apart for exactly the reason I and many others pointed out (supporting me).</p>
<p>Last week a friend said to me that Europe was in worse shape than America. I was unconvinced. I said that I opposed Geithner&#8217;s &#8220;duct-tape solution&#8221;. It would have been better to let things fall apart and then put them back together in a safer way.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MY FRIEND</strong> Duct-tape works.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong> What Geithner did helped those who benefit from the status quo and hurt those who benefit from change. Just like duct tape.</p></blockquote>
<p>This struck me as utterly banal until I read <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21540255">a one-sided editorial in <em>The Economist</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The consequences of the euro’s destruction are so catastrophic that no sensible policymaker could stand by and let it happen. . . .  the threat of a disaster . . . can anything be done to avert disaster?</p></blockquote>
<p>and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/12/05/111205ta_talk_surowiecki">similar remarks in <em>The New Yorker</em></a> (James Surowiecki):</p>
<blockquote><p>The financial crisis in Europe . . . has now entered a potentially disastrous phase.. . . with dire consequences not just for Europe but also for the rest of us. . . . This is that rarest of problems—one that you really can solve just by throwing money at it [= duct tape]</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a sec. What if the Eurozone is a <strong>bad idea</strong>? Like I (and many others) said in 1995? Why perpetuate a bad idea? Why drive further in the wrong direction? Sure, the dissolution will bring temporary trouble (&#8220;disaster&#8221;, &#8220;dire consequences&#8221;), but that will be a small price to pay for getting rid of a bad idea. Of course the Euro had/has pluses and minuses. Anyone who claimed to know that the pluses outweighed the minuses (or vice-verse) was a fool or <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/26/climategate-2-0-behind-the-curtain/">an expert</a>. Now we know more. Given that what the nay-sayers said has come to pass, it is reasonable to think that they (or we) were right: The minuses outweigh the pluses.</p>
<p>You have seen the phrase <em>Japan&#8217;s lost decade</em> a thousand times. You have never seen the phrase <em>Greece&#8217;s lost decade.</em> But Greeks lost an enormous amount from being able to borrow money for stupid conventional projects at too low a rate. Had loans been less available, they would have been more original (the less debt involved, the easier it is to take risks) and started at a smaller scale. Which I believe would have been a better use of their time and led to more innovation. Both <em>The Economist</em>&#8216;s editorial writer and Surowiecki have a status-quo &#8220;duct-tape&#8221; bias without realizing it.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s important here is not what two writers, however influential their magazines, think or fail to think. It is that they are so sure of themselves. They fail to take seriously an alternative (breakup of the Eurozone would in the long run be a good thing) that has at least as much to recommend it as what they are sure of (the breakup would be a &#8220;disaster&#8221;). I believe they are so sure of themselves because they have absorbed (and now imitate) the <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hemineglect">hemineglect</a> of modern economics. The whole field, they haven&#8217;t noticed, has an enormous status-quo bias in its failure to study innovation. Innovation &#8212; how new goods and services are invented and prosper &#8212; should be half the field. Let me repeat: A few years ago I picked up an 800-page introductory economics textbook. It had <strong>one page</strong> (one worthless page) on innovation. In this staggering neglect, it reflected the entire field. The hemineglect of economics professors is just as bad as the hemineglect of epidemiologists (who ignore immune function, study of what makes us better or worse at fighting off microbes) and statisticians (who pay almost no attention to idea generation).</p>
<p><strong>MORE</strong> Even Joe Nocera, whom I like, has trouble grasping that the Euro might be a bad idea. &#8220;The only thing that should matter is what works,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/opinion/nocera-germany-cuts-off-its-nose.html?hp">he writes</a>. Not managing to see that the Euro isn&#8217;t working.</p>

					<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/02/it-matters-when-you-take-vitamin-d-a-stunning-discovery/">I blogged earlier</a> about what I called a &#8220;stunning discovery&#8221;: <a href="http://www.primalgirl.com/2011/11/01/nprimalgirl-sleep-issues-vitamin-d/">Primal Girl found her sleep got much better</a> when she started taking Vitamin D first thing in the morning (= soon after she got up) rather than mid-afternoon. This suggested that Vitamin D acts on your circadian system similar to a blast of sunlight. (More evidence and discussion <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/03/vitamin-d-sunlight-and-sleep-more/">here</a>.) In <a href="http://www.aquatic-ape-diet.com/blog/2011/11/25/dont-take-vitamin-d-at-night/">his blog</a>, Joseph Buchignani reports another experience that supports the idea that you should take Vitamin D first thing in the morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>I picked up a bottle of Vit-D and Calcium. Dosage of Vit-D per pill was 1.6ud. Per the instructions, I took 1 at morning and 1 at night. I began this regimin on the night of the 24th of November. It’s now the night of the 25th of November, and my circadian rhythm is completely fucked. . . .  I’m fully awake now (12:30 AM), and I probably took the last dose of Vit-D around 7-8 PM. . . . I woke up with dark eye rings on the morning of the 25th. My energy level did not rise as it should have, but sort of meandered in the middle, before finally tailing off. Stress levels and depression were both elevated. I got little productive done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I started taking Vitamin D first thing in the morning. I took 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 at 8 am. In the afternoon I felt more energetic than usual. The next morning (this morning) I woke up feeling more rested than usual. This also supports Primal Girl&#8217;s experience. </p>
<p>Let me repeat: first thing in morning. If you wake up before sunrise, take at sunrise (say, 7 am). Sunlight has a considerably different effect on your circadian system at 7 am than 10 am. (Look up <em>circadian phase-response curve</em> and especially the work of <a href="http://www.biol.sc.edu/faculty/decoursy.html">Patricia DeCoursey</a> if you want to understand why three hours makes a big difference.) I have two bottles of Vitamin D. Neither mentions time of day. Both say <em>take with meals</em>.</p>

					<p>The Nobel Prizes awarded each year resemble a kind of report card where each prize-worthy discipline (Physics, Chemistry, etc.) gets a grade that depends on the prize-winning research. If the prize-winning research is useful and surprising, the grade is high. If not the grade is low. More generally, at least to me, the intellectual history of the prize winners sheds light on the whole profession. Perhaps some biologists were unaware of the behavior of Eric Kandel described in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Explorers-Black-Box-Search-Cellular/dp/0595189628"><em>Explorers of the Black Box</em></a> when he was awarded the biology prize. Kandel, I hasten to add, is an unusual case.</p>
<p>Thomas Sargent is one of the winners of this year&#8217;s Economics prize. In 2007, he gave <a href="https://files.nyu.edu/ts43/public/personal/UC_graduation.pdf">a graduation speech</a> at Berkeley to economics majors (via <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/10/assorted-links-247.html">Marginal Revolution</a>). In the speech, Sargent called economics &#8220;organized common sense&#8221;. He went on to list 12 common-sense ideas, such as &#8220;Individuals and communities face trade-offs&#8221; and &#8220;governments and voters respond to incentives&#8221; that economists believe. The reasons for their belief weren&#8217;t stated.</p>
<p>When I started as a professor (at Berkeley) I did many experiments with rats and, to my annoyance, discovered an inconvenient truth: I understood rats less well than I thought. Even in a heavily-controlled heavily-studied situation (Skinner box), my rats often did not do what I expected. My common sense was often wrong, in other words. This experience made me considerably more skeptical of other people&#8217;s &#8220;common sense&#8221;.</p>
<p>To me, and I think to most scientists, science <strong>begins</strong> with common sense. Experimental psychology certainly does. I used common sense to design my experiments. Had I not done those experiments, I would not have learned that my common sense was wrong. So relying on common sense was helpful &#8212; as a place to start. As a way to begin to understand. You begin with common-sense ideas and you test them. That common sense is often wrong is a theme of <em>Freakonomics</em>, in agreement with my experience. Yet Sargent seemed content (he called economics &#8220;our beautiful subject&#8221;) to <strong>end</strong> with common sense, perhaps tidied up.</p>
<p>This is really unfortunate because economics, beautiful or not, is so important. <strong>If you ignore data, the answer to every hard question is the same: the most powerful people are right</strong>. That way lies stagnation (problems build up unsolved because powerful people prefer the status quo) and collapse (when the problems become overwhelming). Alan Greenspan&#8217;s faith-based belief in free markets and the 2008 financial crisis &#8212; after Sargent&#8217;s speech &#8212; is an example. In 2009, Sargent&#8217;s speech might have been less well-received.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, September 28th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/">Edward Jay Epstein</a>&#8216;s newest Kindle book is <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/James-Jesus-Angleton-Original-ebook/dp/B005LPE5SC">James Jesus Angleton: Was He Right?</a></em>. Angleton worked at the CIA most of his career, which spanned the Cold War. He struck some of his colleagues as paranoid: He believed that the CIA could easily contain Russian spies. Colleagues said <em>Oh, no, that couldn&#8217;t happen</em>. After his death, it turned out he was right (e.g., Aldrich Ames). At one point he warned the CIA director, &#8220;an intelligence [agency] is most vulnerable to deception when it considers itself invulnerable to deception.&#8221; </p>
<p>What interests me is the asymmetry of the mistakes. When it really matters, we overestimate far more than underestimate our understanding. CIA employees&#8217; overestimation of their ability to detect deception is a big example. There are innumerable small examples. When people are asked to guess everyday facts (e.g., height of the Empire State Building) and provide 95% confidence intervals for their guesses, their intervals are too short, usually much too short (e.g., the correct answer is outside the intervals 20% of the time). People arrive at destinations more often later than expected than earlier than expected. Projects large and small take longer than expected far more often than shorter than expected. For any one example, there are many possible explanations. But the diversity of examples suggests the common thread is true: We are too sure of what we know.</p>
<p>There are several plausible explanations. One is that it helps groups work together. If people work together toward a single goal, they are more likely to reach that goal and at least learn what happens than if they squabble. Another is the same idea at an individual level. Overconfidence in our beliefs helps us act on them. By acting on them, we learn. Doing nothing teaches less. A third is a mismatch idea: We are overconfident because modern life is more complicated than the Stone-Age world to which evolution adjusted our brains. No one asked Stone-Age people <em>How tall is the Empire State Building?</em> A fourth is that we assume what physicists assume: the distant world follows the same rules as the world close to us. This is a natural assumption, but it&#8217;s wrong. </p>
<p>Early in Angleton&#8217;s career, he had a very unpleasant shock: He realized he had been fooled by the Russians in a big way for a long time. This led him to try to understand why he&#8217;d been fooled. Early in my scientific career, I too was shocked: Rats in Skinner boxes did not act as expected far more often than I would have thought. I overestimated my understanding of them. In a heavily-controlled heavily-studied situation! I generalized from this. If I couldn&#8217;t predict the behavior of rats in a Skinner box, I couldn&#8217;t predict human behavior  in ordinary life. My conclusion was <strong>data is more precious than we think</strong>. In other words, data is underpriced. If a stock is underpriced, you buy as much of it as possible. I tried to collect as much data as possible. Personal science &#8212; studying my sleep, my weight, and so on &#8212; was a way to gather data at essentially zero cost. And, indeed, the results surprised me far more than I expected. I could <strong>act</strong> based on the overconfidence effect but I could not remove it from my expectations.</p>

I liked <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/">Part 1</a> because she described the excellent work of Irving Kirsch (<em>The Emperor&#8217;s New Drugs</em>). <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jul/14/illusions-of-psychiatry/?pagination=false">Part 2</a>, however, is a disaster.</p>
<p>She goes on and on about the evils of the <em>DSM</em>s &#8212; the diagnostic manuals of psychiatry. Improving the reliability of diagnosis is playing into the hands of the drug companies, she seems to say. She complains that the number of diagnoses is increasing. Well, yes, all diagnostic systems get larger over time. This is a good thing; if you don&#8217;t have a name for a problem, it is hard to do cumulative research about it and hard to communicate research results to everyone else. She complains, apparently, that new categories are being added:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are proposals for entirely new entries, such as “hypersexual disorder,” “restless legs syndrome,” and “binge eating.”</p>
<p>She does not say why this is bad. Maybe she thinks it&#8217;s obvious. It isn&#8217;t obvious to me. Diagnostic categories help researchers and doctors and the rest of us communicate. For example, <a href="http://mangans.blogspot.com/2009/05/niacin-for-restless-legs.html">Dennis Mangan&#8217;s research</a> shows why it is a good idea for the term <em>restless legs syndrome</em> to have an agreed-upon meaning.</p>
<p>She complains that the DSM doesn&#8217;t have enough &#8220;citations&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are no citations of scientific studies to support its decisions.  That is an astonishing omission, because in all medical publications,  whether journal articles or textbooks, statements of fact are supposed  to be supported by citations of published scientific studies. (There are  four separate “sourcebooks” for the current edition of the <em>DSM</em> that present the rationale for some decisions, along with references, but that is not the same thing as specific references.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Please. This is clueless. A diagnostic manual is a dictionary. It assigns meanings to diagnostic categories. You can make a useful dictionary without &#8220;citations of scientific studies&#8221;. Long before you can do scientific studies about the best way to define <em>dog</em> you can come up with a definition of <em>dog </em>that is better than nothing.</p>
<p>She ends her review with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Above all, we should remember the time-honored medical dictum: first, do no harm (<em>primum non nocere</em>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Gag me with a spoon. <em>Time-honored</em>? Doctors &#8212; with the support of <em>JAMA</em>, not to mention the rest of the health-care establishment &#8212; continually prescribe drugs with bad side effects and high prices and suppress innovative alternatives. (Not only that. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/08/29/suppose-you-write-the-times-to-fix-an-error-part-2/">My own surgeon</a> recommended a dangerous surgery of no clear value.) How they can claim to do no harm escapes me.</p>
<p>Sure, psychiatry is awful. For a long time psychiatrists rallied around a transparent intellectual fraud (Freud and his offshoots). Now they rally around a less transparent intellectual fraud (neurotransmitter theories of mental illness). Psychotherapists and their wacky theories and no-more-effective treatments are no better so I wouldn&#8217;t blame the drug companies for the underlying problem. I put the problem like this: Our health care system consists of a very large number of people, many with very large salaries, who <strong>must get paid</strong>. Being human, they strongly oppose any progress that would reduce their salary or influence or, heaven forbid, eliminate their job. Because of them, many promising lines of research, such as prevention via environmental change or cure via nutrition, are completely or almost completely ignored. This is the fundamental reason Angell&#8217;s critique is so bad: She is part of the problem. She is very smart, but she&#8217;s been brainwashed (&#8220;<em>primum non nocere</em>&#8220;!). She utterly ignores the fact that we don&#8217;t know what causes depression, what causes schizophrenia, what causes autism, and so forth. Only when we learn what causes these and other mental disorders will we be in a good position to improve our mental health.</p>
