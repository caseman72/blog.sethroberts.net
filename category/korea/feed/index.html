				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I wrote <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/04/13/burnt-sugar-grapefruit-give-thanks-for-south-korea/" target="_blank">my recent post about Korean innovation</a>, I noticed an example in downtown Berkeley. A few months ago, the Korean bakery Paris Baguette opened a branch in a good location (next to a BART station) that has seen two businesses &#8212; two different cafe chains &#8212; fail in the last 5 or 6 years. It seemed to be doing well. There were more customers than I&#8217;d ever seen with the previous business (Tully&#8217;s Coffee). <a href="http://www.parisbaguetteusa.com/" target="_blank">Paris Baguette</a> has about 20 American branches.</p>
<p>Jane Jacobs once called Berkeley a &#8220;pretentious suburb&#8221; but it is where Peet&#8217;s &#8212; the original of Starbucks &#8212; began and where Chez Panisse is. It had a farmer&#8217;s market and an emphasis on organic food long before the rest of America. (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/case-study/organic-food-doesn%E2%80%99t-lower-overall-cancer-risk" target="_blank">A new survey</a> suggests the health benefit of organic food is small or zero.) If you could call a location an &#8220;early adopter&#8221; Berkeley would qualify, but that would be understating it. Via the Free Speech Movement and the whole notion of student protest, little Berkeley shaped an entire decade (the Sixties). But it seems to have been a long time, like half a century, since anything important started here. The Bay Area, however, remains enormously innovative (Google, Twitter, Intel, and so on).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Marginal Revolution commenter <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/04/jurgen-osterhammel-on-the-crimean-war.html" target="_blank">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>South Korea being prosperous has had no benefit to me, yet I have borne the cost.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say: Wait ten years. No country combines innovation and quality like South Korea. Samsung illustrates quality but the innovation is less clear. Here are examples.<span id="more-13453"></span></p>
<p>1. <strong>Food preparation</strong>. In Seoul, a friend took me to an American-style buffet. <em>Nothing could be worse</em>, I thought. But I was blown away by original treatments of familiar things. One was an octopus salad. It was truly chewy and crunchy, in contrast to most restaurant salads. Whoever designed it understood underlying principles &#8212; they weren&#8217;t just mindlessly copying. The fruit on offer included burnt sugar grapefruit &#8212; small pieces of grapefruit with a little bit of added sugar, then torched. The burnt sugar adds complexity. A simple small cheap attractive practical dish &#8212; not grilled grapefruit with too much brown sugar.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Cafes</strong>. Seoul is bursting with little cafes that are pleasant places to spend a few hours. They are well-decorated (many individually-decorated), serve interesting food and drink, and make Starbucks look cold, hard and stodgy. You can easily spend $6 on dinner and $6 on a drink afterwards but the $6 drink seems worth it. One Korean explained the profusion of beautiful useful cafes on competition (&#8220;Koreans are very competitive&#8221;). Another Korean said it was the TV series <em>Sex in the City</em> (&#8220;The characters spent a lot of time in cafes&#8221;). There are two Korean cafes near where I live in Beijing.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Bakery</strong>. <a href="http://discoveringkorea.com/100218/seouls-best-bakeries/" target="_blank">Korean bakeries</a> have what Americans expect in a bakery, such as bread and croissants, but also have many more products, both baked goods and other food, than American bakeries. There are many Korean bakeries in Beijing.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Airport</strong>. Incheon Airport was voted the best airport in the world for 7 years; in the most recent two years, it was voted second best. I&#8217;m not sure this reflects innovation that future airport architects will want to study; new airports have a huge advantage for which I cannot adjust. But Incheon has free wifi that works; Beijing International Airport has free wifi that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Door lock</strong>. Nice houses and apartments in Seoul have a kind of digital door lock I haven&#8217;t seen anywhere else. Via Google I found <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Security-Keyless-Entry-Electronic-Digital-Door-lock-Milre-MI-3710-Aurora-/271027354688" target="_blank">this</a> &#8212; which, lo and behold, comes from South Korea. These locks are better in several ways than other electronic door locks. For example, the keys are lit. My guess is that new houses and apartments in America don&#8217;t have these locks because Americans don&#8217;t even know they exist. Apparently a South Korean company (Milre) figured out that substantial improvement was possible. There isn&#8217;t even an English Wikipedia entry for Milre, yet it will have more effect on your life than, oh, 99.999% of the current entries.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Pop music</strong>. Gangnam style, obviously; K-Pop, slightly less obviously, if you don&#8217;t live in Asia. Gangnam style = K-Pop plus humor.</p>
<p>Keep in mind South Korea is small (population 50 million; the population of Japan is 130 million). A country that is a lot more prosperous now than 30 years ago is a good place to innovate because all the crummy old stuff is being replaced &#8212; that is clear. It is also a big plus for innovation if its citizens are well-educated. If you understand that, and how bad the United States is at innovation (housing, health care, cars, education . . . ), you will see that helping South Korea become prosperous was a great investment. Inadvertently great, but great nonetheless.</p>
<p>In <i>Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel&#8217;s Economic Miracle</i>, the authors (Dan Senor and Saul Singer) argued that Israel is unusually innovative because no one defers to their superiors, everyone challenges everyone else (&#8220;The Israeli said, &#8220;What does &#8220;excuse me&#8221; mean?&#8221;). In The Ethnic Theory of Air Crashes, a chapter in <i>Outliers</i>, Malcolm Gladwell repeated the theory that Korean Air had a lot of crashes because co-pilots were too deferential. Which is only to say we have a lot to learn about innovation and South Korea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I was in Seoul, at <a href="http://casapepepark.com/" target="_blank">Casa Pepe Guest House</a>. Sensationally good at a very low price. It really is a guest house &#8212; attached to a house &#8212; with a separate entrance. There are four rooms, with shared kitchen and bathroom. The owner is an renowned chef. The first evening he brought salad and wine from his (Japanese) restaurant. The first morning, he invited me to come with him to buy fish at the Seoul fish market. Every morning, he made breakfast &#8212; something different each time.</p>
<p>I found it through hotels.com. On their map, it was off by itself. I thought that meant bad location, but the opposite was true. It is the sort of good location you cannot normally get. It is near the Blue House (Korea&#8217;s White House) and many foreign embassies and is very safe. Dozens of interesting restaurants and cafes are nearby. (Even more than the rest of Seoul.) The neighborhood is the Beverly Hills of Korea, with better (and cheaper) restaurants and less pretentious architecture. Casa Pepe started about a year ago, with a remodelling. Everything is new and clean. The floor is heated. The building is up a steep path and has a nice view of streets, hills and houses. Free laundry. All for less than $50/day.</p>
<p>During my stay I briefly overlapped with <i>a Tsinghua student</i> (how could that possibly happen?) but otherwise I was the only person.</p>
<p>Why is it so nice? The owner said, &#8220;It&#8217;s my hobby.&#8221; I think that explains it.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve said</a> that doing a job and doing science are fundamentally incompatible. Any job requires steady and repeated output. You do the same thing over and over. The goal of science is discovery &#8212; and a discovery is inherently unpredictable and unrepeatable. (Art is a job with science-like elements &#8212; and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">artists were the first scientists</a>.) Casa Pepe Guest House illustrates another side of the job/science conflict: A job is inherently conformist. You give people, especially customers and your boss, what they expect. Science is inherently nonconformist. The more a discovery challenges &#8220;what everyone knows&#8221;, the better. Hobbies make this point because they can vary more than jobs. If you make tables as a hobby, for example, your tables can vary more than if you make tables for a living. Casa Pepe is way outside (better) what one expects from a rented room.</p>
<p>Another way Casa Pepe is unusual is that it is very hard to find, even if you study <a href="http://casapepepark.com/sub01/sub02.php" target="_blank">the directions</a>. I found it by knocking on a neighbor&#8217;s door. The neighbor called Casa Pepe. Someone from Casa Pepe came to meet the neighbor and me on the street &#8212; it was too hard <em>to tell the neighbor</em> where it was. Here are better directions. From Incheon Airport, take airport bus 6112 to the Hangsun University stop. Go to Exit 6 of the nearby subway station (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansung_University_Station" target="_blank">Hangsun University Station</a> on Line 4). Walk up the street (Seongbuk-ro) indicated by Exit 6 &#8212; toward the hills. After walking about 13 minutes, where the road veers right, you will see a sign that says <strong>Seongbuk-ro 19-gil</strong> (gil = side street), which points almost exactly to a steep concrete path on the left perpendicular to the street. It is the width of a driveway. Go up about 40 meters. Casa Pepe is on the right &#8212; a white house with a red door, with a sign that says &#8220;casa pepe&#8221;. Don&#8217;t be misled by the fact that the listed address is not on Seongbuk-ro 19-gil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, a Korean friend of mine spent a college year abroad in Tanzania. In South Korea, access to information about North Korea on the Internet was blocked. In Tanzania, it wasn&#8217;t. Impressed by what she learned, she cut-and-pasted some of it into an email to her sister.</p>
<p>After she sent the email, she remembered that in South Korea it was illegal to cut-and-paste from a website. She called her mom to tell her sister not to read the email. The message was successfully conveyed and her sister deleted the email without reading it.</p>
<p>In the last year, however, the South Korean government has changed its policy and is now trying to educate citizens about life in North Korea. Information is no longer blocked. Now and then people escape. They are put on show and tell about North Korean life many times. The intention is to prepare for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_reunification" target="_blank">the coming reunification</a>. <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/south-korea-forming-committee-to-prepare-for-reunifcation-with-north-korea/1858571.html" target="_blank">Special committees have been formed</a> to discuss how to solve the anticipated problems.</p>
<p>We are used to hearing about the advantages of dividing one country into two, but my friend had no trouble explaining why the South Korean government wanted reunification. One reason was that the war with North Korea was very expensive. Another was that families had been divided. A third was that since North Korea has nuclear weapons, reunification will mean that South Korea has them. (My friend had not read <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2014-03/03/c_133156820.htm" target="_blank">a certain newspaper article</a> the day she said that.) <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25911981" target="_blank">This article</a> suggests that the real reason cannot be said out loud. It is that reunification will allow South Korea to take advantage of the land and people freed by the collapse of North Korea.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you learned from the reunification of Germany?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be chaos for a long time,&#8221; she said.</p>
