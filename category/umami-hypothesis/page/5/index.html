				<small>Wednesday, February 10th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>Gut And Psychology Syndrome</em> (GAPS) is a book by Natasha Campbell-McBride about how to treat allergies, autism, and similar conditions.Â  In <a href="http://www.cheeseslave.com/2008/08/22/gaps-diet-testimonial-aspergers-allergies-and-asthma/">this entry</a>, Cheeseslave talks about her own son and then quotes another mother about the effects of the GAPS diet (plus other changes) on her autistic son.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kevin lacked oxygen at birth, so in the first year of life, I already saw that he was not developing like my other kids (he is our 5th). His motor skills lagged and he cried a lot, didnâ€™t sleep so well, etc.At two, his behavior was just not right. He never responded right to correction, would throw things in anger or frustration, cried all the time, especially when waking up, basically never happy. He didnâ€™t walk until two and then he would fall down constantly.</p>
<p>He also began to always be starving. When he was really hungry, his face would get distorted and frozen in a strange way. I now think he was having seizures of sorts.</p>
<p>We did not vaccinate at all and we figured out that if we fed him lots of protein type foods like meats, he would relax his body and face and be able to go play for a bit until it happened all over again in a short time.</p>
<p>I do think that because we didnâ€™t vaccinate and figured out to keep feeding him this way, we were able to â€œcoast alongâ€ like this for years. He had learning disabilities, lacked social skills and continued to have autistic traits like sensory issues, hiding under blankets, reacting to sounds, not liking people around, rigid in routines, and spinning and going on his head along with head banging.</p>
<p>Long story shorter, we did get a diagnosis of Aspergers at one point. We took him to doctor after doctor, specialist after specialist to no avail. He also strangely was NEVER once sick (we later learned that his immune system was not working a bit).</p>
<p>At 9 years old, he got pneumonia, followed by asthma and allergies. His eating [problems] had escalated to the point of feeding him every 20-30 minutes or he would have gigantic meltdowns. We eventually could not even have people over.</p>
<p>He was given an inhaler for the asthma and suddenly, without us making the connection, he began to not respond when called, became extremely hyperactive and began to run away at all hours of the day and night requiring police to find him and being very dangerous. (we once lost him in the middle of downtown Chicago). He would also try to jump out of moving vehicles, out of windows and required constant restraining.</p>
<p>The seizures got bad, he would fall down the stairs and lose consciousness several times per day. They tried psych drugs and he almost died twice from his reaction to them (I am now grateful that we couldnâ€™t go that route).</p>
<p>We became so desperate that we brought him home from hospital and got deadbolts to keep him from running, did all our own restraining and called alternative docs to help us.</p>
<p>We began kefir and diet from nutritionist (basically a BED [Body Ecology Diet]/GAPS version), took him off inhaler. His allergies were totally out of control, he could barely open his eyes from swelling, and his chin was deformed and swollen, his belly too, his whole body. He would only eat junk food and fast foods and it was incredibly difficult to transition him to the diet.</p>
<p>The DAN (Defeat Autism Now) protocols we followed, made him worse in lots of ways b/c the chelation made him extremely violent, the B12 shots kept him awake for nights on end without any sleep, the antifungals and all those other interventions were nightmarish for him.</p>
<p>Eventually, I resolved to use only foods and do this without any kind of doctors. So for this past year, I researched and researched and was determined to bring him back from this state. We have done a combo of GAPS (and BED) very successfully along with lots of fermented foods and drinks.</p>
<p>The allergies and asthma are 100% gone, the seizures we have had only one in 65 days and very mild (compared to 5-10 per day). He sings every morning and has cried once in the last 2.5 months (he used to cry for 1-3 hours at a time each day) and he can go outside again without running away. He is in martial arts, acting appropriately at church, having eye contact, no autistic traits of late and learning academics after two years of not being able to open a book. He reads before bed at an 8th grade level.</p></blockquote>
<p>This story has many interesting elements. 1. Huge improvement. Very plausible that it&#8217;s due to the dietary change. 2. Autism and allergies go away at the same time, suggesting same cause. 3. Treatment with fermented foods. 4. A different &#8220;radical&#8221; solution failed, meaning there is no reason to think this is a placebo effect. 5. The mystery of why an inhaler made things worse. 6. Autism not due to vaccination.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, February 3rd, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A new study in the <em>Archives of General Psychiatry</em>, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704107204575039590838522222.html">summarized in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers in the new study identified 81 people, ages 13 to 25, with warning signs of psychosis, including sleeping much more or less than usual, growing suspicious of others, believing someone is putting thoughts in their head or believing they have magical powers. Forty-one were randomly assigned to take four fish oil pills a day for three months. The other patients took dummy pills.</p>
<p>After a year of monitoring, 2 of the 41 patients in the fish oil group, or about 5%, had become psychotic, or completely out of touch with reality. In the placebo group, 11 of 40 became psychotic, about 28%.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study is impressive not only because it uses ordinary food (fish oil) rather thanÂ  dangerous drugs (such as Prozac) but also because it studies prevention. Just as <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/01/24/animal-fat-sleep-and-the-ketogenic-diet/">the ketogenic diet suggests a widespread animal-fat deficiency</a>, so this study suggests a widespread omega-3 deficiency, which won&#8217;t surprise any reader of this blog. Completing the picture &#8212; I believe most Americans eat far too little animal fat, omega-3, and fermented food &#8212; <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100202201622.htm">baker&#8217;s yeast is being studied as a cure for cancer</a>.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, January 26th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.carlsfinefilms.com/">Carl Willat</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2007/5384.html">this press release</a> about some remarkable research:</p>
<blockquote><p>Treatment of mice with a â€˜friendlyâ€™ bacteria, normally found in the soil, altered their behavior in a way similar to that produced by antidepressant drugs, reports research published in the latest issue of <em>Neuroscience. </em><em>. . .Â </em></p>
<p>Interest in the project arose after human cancer patients being treated with the bacteria Mycobacterium vaccae unexpectedly reported increases in their quality of life.</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/umami-hypothesis/">we need a substantial daily intake of microbes (in our food) to be healthy</a>. The obvious microbe-produced improvements are in immune function and digestion. But this study and the research on which it&#8217;s based suggest we also need microbes to make our nervous systems work properly.</p>
<p>When I started eating lots of fermented food I did notice an improvement in mood. Not dramatic, but clear. On a trip to Boston last year, I thought: I&#8217;ll go without fermented foods to see what it&#8217;s like. But after a day or so without them, I felt so bad I stopped the experiment. A friend of mine says something similar, that kombucha improves his mood in a way that doesn&#8217;t seem to be due to caffeine.</p>
<p>I asked Carl how he learned about a three-year-old press release. (The research article &#8212; <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&#038;_udi=B6T0F-4NC5T69-D&#038;_user=4420&#038;_coverDate=05%2F11%2F2007&#038;_alid=1180771615&#038;_rdoc=7&#038;_fmt=high&#038;_orig=search&#038;_cdi=4861&#038;_sort=r&#038;_docanchor=&#038;view=c&#038;_ct=9&#038;_acct=C000059607&#038;_version=1&#038;_urlVersion=0&#038;_userid=4420&#038;md5=54d3f714f991346c2dc5f456817b5f78">gated version here</a> &#8212; appeared in 2007.) &#8220;Neil Gaiman tweeted about it,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<small>Sunday, January 17th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>At a Beijing &#8220;food and wine exhibition&#8221; (which was 95% wine) my favorite drinks were the Lindemans fruity beers &#8212; a type of beer called <em>lambic</em>. The label of the raspberry (<em>framboise</em>) one says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lindemans Framboise is a lambic made from local barley, unmalted wheat, and wild [= air-borne] yeast.Â  After spontaneous fermentation, raspberries are added, creating a secondary fermentation and yielding a beer of exceptional flavor and complexity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe the presence of two quite different fermentations (grain and fruit) <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/01/04/psychophysics-of-complexity/">is why it tastes so good</a>, just as this says. To me, the more important point is the linkage of fermentation and complexity &#8212; the idea that fermentation creates complexity.</p>

					<p>There isn&#8217;t one fermented food on <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/the-11-best-foods-you-arent-eating/?em">a list of &#8220;the 11 best foods you aren&#8217;t eating&#8221;</a> compiled by Tara Parker-Pope, author of the world&#8217;s most visible health blog. Nor do any of the listed foods contain animal fat. One of them (sardines) is high in omega-3, so the list gets a D instead of an F. Fermented foods and animal fat (in sufficient quantity) have easily-noticed benefits, in contrast to every food on the list. Parker-Pope and the nutritionist she consulted (Jenny Bowden) have large gaps in their understanding of nutrition.</p>

					<p>Of course I loved <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/01/04/psychophysics-of-complexity/#comment-379792">this comment</a> on <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/01/04/psychophysics-of-complexity/">a recent post of mine about how to flavor stuff</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I made a vegetable soup today spiced by small amounts of vegetable stock, hoi sin sauce, angostura bitters, lea &amp; perrins worcestershire sauce, Kikkomann soy sauce, maggi wrze, marmite, maille mustard. I can honestly say it was the best tasting soup I, or any of my guests, can remember having been served.</p></blockquote>
<p>I routinely make soups that taste clearly better than any of the thousands of soups I had before I figured out the secret. There is no failure (I&#8217;ve done it 20-odd times), no worry about over- or under-cooking. Something else odd: There seems to be a ceiling effect. The texture could be better, the appearance could be much better, the creaminess could be better, sometimes the temperature could be better, the sourness could be better, but I can&#8217;t imagine it could be more delicious.<br />
Why wasn&#8217;t this figured out earlier? I&#8217;ve looked at hundreds of cookbooks and thousands of recipes. I haven&#8217;t seen one that combines three or more sources of great complexity, as I do and the commenter did. There may be more trial and error surrounding cooking than anything else in human life. Billions of meals, day after day.</p>
<p>I think it goes back to my old comment (derived from Jane Jacobs) that <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/05/02/how-could-they-know-the-case-of-healthy-gums/">farmers didn&#8217;t invent tractors</a>. Some people claimed they did but I think we can all agree farmers didn&#8217;t invent the engine on which tractors are based. You can&#8217;t get to tractors from trial and error around pre-tractor farming methods. Even though farmers are expert at farming. I think that&#8217;s what happened here. I am not a food professional or even a skilled cook. My expertise is in psychology (especially psychology and food). Wondering why we like umami, sour, and complex flavors led me to a theory (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/umami-hypothesis/">the umami hypothesis</a>) that led me to a new idea about how to cook.</p>
<p>And this goes back to what many people, including Atul Gawande, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/05/29/the-american-health-paradox-what-causes-it/">fail to understand about how to improve our healthcare system</a>. The supposed experts, with their vast credentials, can&#8217;t fix it &#8212; just as farmers couldn&#8217;t invent tractors. Impossible. The experts (doctors, medical school professors, drug companies, alternative healers) have a serious case of <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/11/17/gatekeeper-syndrome/">gatekeeper syndrome</a>. The really big improvements will come from outsiders. Outsiders who benefit from change. To fix our healthcare system, empower them.</p>

					<p>If I need evidence that we like complex flavors, I will quote <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/11/23/091123fa_fact_colapinto?currentPage=all">this passage from <em>The New Yorker</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œThis sauce is really good,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s so Jean-Georges. He does this French-and-Asian thing.â€ She warned me that she would need a few seconds to figure out its precise ingredients. (She refused to divulge them, on the ground that Vongerichten would consider the recipe â€œa trade secret.â€ I later learned from one of the waiters that the ingredients include powdered English mustard and soy sauce.) â€œItâ€™s so complex,â€ she said. â€œIt makes me smile.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>The soy sauce is fermented. As any regular reader of this blog knows, I believe we evolved to like complex flavors so that we would eat more bacteria-rich food. So we have something in our brain that measures complexity of smell/flavor and translates that into pleasure: the more complexity, the more pleasure.</p>
<p>My experience of cooking is that it isn&#8217;t easy to produce a lot of complexity using spices and stuff like garlic and ginger. It&#8217;s possible but not easy. Ordinary recipes, such as in <em>Saveur</em>, aim for a low level, with 5-8 spices. Chinese Five Spice has 5 spices; spice mixtures might have 8; curry powders might have 10. At Whole Foods, the ready-to-eat soups have twenty-odd ingredients. Apparently their soup designers don&#8217;t find it easy, either.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/03/29/the-nutrition-lesson-hidden-in-a-bowl-of-miso-soup/">I discovered that miso<strong> by itself</strong> produced sufficient complexity</a>. Miso soup doesn&#8217;t feel &#8220;under-complex&#8221;. Finally I understood why wine is such a powerful flavoring agent; wine, like miso, is fermented. It makes sense that foods that our complexity detectorÂ  evolved to make us eat do a better job of setting off that detector than other foods.</p>
<p>Now consider how that detector works. Suppose you have two sources of sodium &#8212; two different salts, for example. You get the same saltiness from 2 g of Salt A as you do from 1 g of Salt A and 1 g of Salt B. I think complexity is quite different. I suspect that 2 g of Source A (e.g., miso) will produce a lot less complexity than 1 g of Source A and 1 g of Source B (e.g., wine).</p>
<p>I tried adding two fermented flavoring agents (miso and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukudani">tsukudani</a>) to soup. It worked! The result tasted clearly better than miso alone. Now I do this routinely. It&#8217;s very easy. The results have a level of deliciousness I can&#8217;t remember encountering before. Everything else I can eat (such as restaurant food) now seems less delicious. I think that three sources works better than two; whether four is noticeably better than three I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>The basic idea is there are strong sources of complexity (fermented foods) and weak ones (all other flavoring agents). One strong source = 10-20 weak sources. You get the best results by using several strong sources of complexity, perhaps three or more. Once you know this you no longer: 1. Obsess over recipe details (as in the <em>New Yorker</em> quote) because all complexity is alike and easily produced, just as no one worries about the source of saltiness. 2. Think traditional, time-honored recipes are better than what you can make yourself (e.g., <em>Saveur</em>). As far as I can tell food professionals (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/01/18/how-things-begin-sparkling-tea/">with one big exception)</a> don&#8217;t understand this. I really enjoyed <em>Top Chef Masters</em> (a competition between 12 of the best chefs in America) but there was an almost total absence of fermented foods. Perhaps one chef used soy sauce. The winner, Rick Bayless, made a mole sauce. Mole sauces, which combine 20-odd weak sources of complexity, take hours. I think they produce less complexity than three fermented sources put together, which takes about a minute.</p>

					<p>In James Michener&#8217;s <em>Poland </em>(1983), a Polish peasant in a concentration camp tries to survive by thinking about food (p. 532 of the paperback):</p>
<blockquote><p>He then transferred his imagination to a supper served at the wedding of a well-to-do farmer, where huge platters of sauerkraut, sausage, boiled pork and pickles had been provided, one to each of six tables, and he had helped himself piggishly, moving from one to the other so as not to reveal his gluttony. Â He recalled this particular feast for two reasons: as a peasant, he knew that the acid bite of the pickled kraut was good for him, all peasants knew that and it was one reason why they survived so long; and he could see in the rich fat of the meats the strength that came from them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later he thinks about animal fat:</p>
<blockquote><p>He imagined himself luxuriating with platters of butter, or grease, or pork drippings, or oil that rich people bought from Spain, or the golden globules at the edge of a roast, or plain lard.</p>

At my local Beijing supermarket yesterday, I asked a butcher to cut the meat off a piece of pork fat. Reverse trimming. At the moment, I think about 180 g of animal fat/day is a good dose. I&#8217;m much less concerned about amount of meat. Another instance, I thought to myself, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/04/22/trying-to-buy-expired-food/">where I want the opposite of everyone else</a>.

				<small>Friday, December 18th, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>At a dinner for foreign teachers at Tsinghua, I met a Canadian woman who teaches English literature. Soon after she moved to China, she started having nightmares every night. For dreams, they were unusually linear and realistic. They were nightmares in the sense that they felt &#8220;sinister&#8221;. This hadn&#8217;t happened to her before. It was especially puzzling because she was having a good time.</p>
<p>On a forum for foreigners in Beijing, she asked what might be causing the problem. MSG, she was told. All Chinese restaurants use MSG. She started cooking her own food. The problem went away. Whenever she ate a restaurant meal, the problem returned. The time between meal and sleep made a difference. The dreams would be more vivid if she slept soon after the meal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msgmyth.com/discus/messages/1/326.html?1222538916">Here</a> is a discussion of the MSG/nightmare link with many stories about it. I believe we like the taste of MSG because glutamate is created when proteins are digested by bacteria. We like glutamate because we need to eat bacteria to be healthy. Bacteria are too big and varied to detect directly; it&#8217;s much easier to evolve a glutamate detector.Â  The problem is that now you can have glutamate in your food without bacteria. Apparently cooked tomatoes and garlic are other sources.</p>
<p>With PubMed I found two relevant articles. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2909977?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&#038;ordinalpos=13">One reported an experiment</a> where hyperactive boys got better when additives, including MSG, were removed from their food. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/724894?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&#038;ordinalpos=20">The other</a> is a review article about the effects of MSG that mentions sleep.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure from the personal stories that MSG causes nightmares &#8212; and therefore probably also causes other problems. (That glutamate is a neurotransmitter makes the MSG-nightmare link even more likely.) Here are <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19389112?ordinalpos=1&#038;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum">researchers from the Scripps Clinic in San Diego saying MSG is safe</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the first description of the &#8216;Monosodium glutamate symptom complex&#8217;, originally described in 1968 as the &#8216;Chinese restaurant syndrome&#8217;, a number of anecdotal reports and small clinical studies of variable quality have attributed a variety of symptoms to the dietary ingestion of MSG. . . . Despite concerns raised by early reports, decades of research [this review was published in 2009] have failed to demonstrate a clear and consistent relationship between MSG ingestion and the development of these conditions..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the woman I met did in a week or so (establish that MSG has bad effects), medical researchers &#8212; at least, judging by this review &#8212; have failed to do in 41 years (&#8220;decades of research&#8221;). Just as dermatologists have been unable to figure out that <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/acne/">acne is caused by diet</a>.</p>

					<p>According to BBC News, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8373690.stm">recent research supports the hygiene hypothesis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Normal bacteria living on the skin trigger a pathway that helps prevent inflammation when we get hurt, the US team discovered. The bugs dampen down overactive immune responses that can cause cuts and grazes to swell, they say.</p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8241774.stm">other recent research says it&#8217;s wrong</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decades-old &#8220;hygiene hypothesis&#8221; holds that early exposure to microbes somehow challenges the immune system and strengthens it against allergies. Studies have shown children exposed to bugs by older siblings or attending nursery cut their future allergy risk.</p>
<p>But new work published by the American Thoracic Society casts doubt on this.</p>
<p>The study by Dutch investigators at the Erasmus University found although children in day care got more colds and other infections, they were just as likely as other children to go on to develop asthma or another allergy by the age of eight. The children who went to nursery and who had older siblings had more than quadruple the risk of frequent chest infections and double the risk of wheezing in early life, with no obvious pay off in terms of later protection from allergy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The original hygiene hypothesis said that exposure to <strong>harmful </strong>germs (e.g., that cause colds) cuts down on allergy risk. But it&#8217;s now clear it&#8217;s the exposure to <strong>harmless </strong>germs (e.g., in dirt) that&#8217;s helpful.</p>
<p>Allergies in the UK have tripled in the last 10 years. I believe this is due to greater consumption of food that is germ-free, such as factory food and restaurant food. Shelf-life considerations and food-safety laws, in other words.</p>
<p>Advice given by Allergy UK:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best advice we can currently give to parents is not to smoke around their children and make sure they have a balanced diet and get plenty of exercise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not even close to what I think. My advice is: Feed your kids plenty of fermented food, such as yogurt. I&#8217;d bet a lot of money that my advice is better.<br />

					<p>A year and a half ago, Charles Richardson was given antibiotics for an ulcer. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When they put me on the course of antibiotics for the ulcer, my digestion absolutely went south. Stools became runny and smelly and irregularly timed. Even though I took a lot of supposedly high-end probiotic capsules, that went on for months after the antibiotics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Six months ago &#8212; a year after the antibiotics &#8212; he started drinking kefir because of this blog. &#8220;After about a month [of kefir], I was back to normal,&#8221; he writes. He got the starter culture from <a href="http://kefirlady.com/">kefirlady.com</a> (where they cost $20 cash).</p>
<p>More recently he has seen further improvements:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had a number of food allergies, particularly wheat. If I ate any wheat, I&#8217;d get hemorrhoids immediately, and sometimes what looked like a herpes outbreak.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had that for 30 years or so, but it appears to have gone away in the last month. I had to eat some pasta at a formal dinner, and was expecting a reaction, but had none. I was shocked. I also have a similar reaction to chicken, and had the some non-experience with some of that recently.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know to what I can attribute that change. The kefir could have helped,and possibly the Vitamin D [about 4000 units/day]. I also started take an amino acid dipeptide of L-glutamine/L-alanine. <a href="http://www.kyowa-usa.com/brands/sustamine.html" target="_blank">http://www.kyowa-usa.com/brands/sustamine.html</a>) [about 10 g/day]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is informative for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, the bad effects of the antibiotics lasted a really long time (a year). This indicates how bacteria-poor a normal American diet is. Richardson probably ate healthier than normal given that he once owned a health-food store.</p>
<p>Second, expensive probiotics didn&#8217;t help. This is why I make kombucha and yogurt, to have more quality control. And yogurt is surely closer to what our ancient ancestors ate to get bacteria than probiotic capsules.</p>
<p>Third, the kefir took about a month to solve the problem. This gives an idea of the time it takes to repopulate your intestine with bacteria. And thus how long you should try this or that solution before giving up.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.reutershealth.com/archive/2009/11/20/eline/links/20091120elin012.html">A study using a rat model of acid reflux</a> found that the problem is inflammation caused by the immune system, not stomach acid damaging tissue, as had previously been thought.</p>
<blockquote><p>[The] study in rats showed that gastroesophageal refluxÂ  causes tissue in the esophagus to release immune chemicals called cytokines, which attract inflammatory cells. These cause the heartburn and chest pain that make GERD [gastroesophageal reflux disease]<font face="Arial, Sans-Serif"> so distressing.</font></p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, we treat GERD by giving medications to prevent the stomach from making acid,&#8221; said Dr. Rhonda Souza, who led the study published in the November issue of Gastroenterology.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if GERD is really an immune-mediated injury, maybe we should create medications that would prevent these cytokines from attracting inflammatory cells to the esophagus and starting the injury in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Months ago <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/08/10/acid-reflux-cured-by-kombucha-yes/">I posted about a friend of mine whose acid reflux was cured by drinking kombucha</a>. The implication of that case and the rat study is that acid reflux is caused by an over-active immune system. Perhaps stomach acid often gets into the esophagus. Only if your immune system is under-stimulated does this cause trouble.</p>
<p>Acid reflux is very common. According to the article, 20% of Americans &#8220;have it regularly&#8221;. All this supports my view that we need plenty of bacteria in our diet to be healthy, that few Americans get enough bacteria in their diet, and that the deficiency causes all sorts of digestive and immune problems.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, November 4th, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A friend writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As of today I&#8217;m getting over my fourth cold since I began eating lots of yogurt (maybe 1-2 cups a day, homemade), which was roughly in March of this year. So that would be a rate of about a cold every two months. On the one hand that sounds pretty terrible. On the other hand, a couple of things to think about:</p>
<p>1. I used to always get colds and other sicknesses as well. They just seem to be attracted to me. By my intuition, the current rate doesn&#8217;t seem particularly unusual, although I never kept track before. If anyone had a cold anywhere around me, invariably I got it. It&#8217;s been that way as long as I can remember, especially when I was traveling, as I have been during these last few months.</p>
<p>2. Each of the colds I have had in this last eight month period has been remarkably short. Really remarkable, so I will remark, by way of example, that this cold came out of the blue yesterday evening with a fit of sneezing. I hadn&#8217;t felt bad at all earlier in the day although in retrospect it&#8217;s possible I was a bit worn down (or maybe not: I took a half-hour swim in the late afternoon and felt pretty good). So I sneezed my way through an evening, nose dripping like a faucet. Before going to sleep I took some sort of medicine for cold symptoms (maybe something made by Bufferin maybe? Night/day something&#8230;), and in the morning I took the same thing (day version). During that whole time I was still pretty symptomatic: sneezing, nose dripping etc., but I guess the medicine might have been somewhat useful. Now here it is 2:30 in the afternoon and all of a sudden I realize my nose is dry and I haven&#8217;t sneezed for hours. I reckon this is about the end of the cold: less than 24 hours. The other three were like that as well: very quick onset, then disappearing almost before I could have time to realize I had a cold. For me this is particularly noteworthy because in years past I always seemed to get the worst of the colds, going on for days and often progressing into a hacking cough that would linger for weeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect if my friend improved his sleep he would get see further improvement of these measures of illness. In <a href="http://www.ehjournal.net/content/pdf/1476-069X-4-25.pdf">this study</a>, the frequency of sickness episodes went down for workers given a probiotic but their duration, when they happened, didn&#8217;t change &#8212; perhaps because it was nice to be away from work.</p>
<p>After I copy-and-pasted that, <strong>I</strong> got sick. It wasn&#8217;t sickness as most people know it. After an afternoon walk (1 hour) I felt tired; that was the first sign. After dinner, I felt really tired. That was an unmistakable sign. I went to bed early, slept about 8 hours (1-2 hours more than usual) and woke up rested. But an hour later I fell back asleep for 15 minutes. At that point I was sure something was wrong. I had a class that morning starting at 10 am. <em>Should I cancel it?</em> I got much more tired and, about two hours before class, was too tired to get out of bed to turn off the beeping yogurt maker. <em>Okay, I&#8217;ll cancel class. </em>I phoned the TA to cancel the class but he couldn&#8217;t &#8212; he had a bad cold. I phoned a student and she phoned the other students.</p>
<p>An hour later, however, I felt much better. By class time I felt well enough to go to class, although I walked rather than ride my bike. (The student did her best to uncancel the class.) In the afternoon I took a long nap (1.5 hours). The next day I was just barely more tired than usual. Today I feel completely well.</p>
<p>I was sick, yes, but without chills, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat &#8212; without any discomfort at all unless feeling tired counts as discomfort. And I felt distinctly more tired than usual for only about a day. I think this is what happens when your immune system works properly. You fight stuff off much faster than the five days or so many people take to get better. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">Before I figured out how to improve my sleep, I got the usual 4-6 colds per year</a>. After I started to sleep much better, I never got sick in the usual runny-nose way so long as my sleep was good. The current episode is striking to me because I was <strong>more </strong>sick &#8212; that is, more tired &#8212; than usual. I do only two things to make my immune system work better: (a) improve my sleep in several ways (eat animal fat, get plenty of morning light, stand on one foot); and (b) eat plenty of fermented foods (mostly yogurt, but also miso, kimchi, natto, and kombucha).</p>

					<p>I watched <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/16/60minutes/main5390519.shtml">this <em>60 Minutes</em> piece on swine flu</a>. Of course nothing was said about boosting immunity as a defense. &#8220;The best way to reduce your chances of one of those terrible outcomes [hospitalization, death] is to be vaccinated,&#8221; said Anne Schuchat, who has a very high position at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>This is just part of a bigger delusion. The story centers on a football player who gets seriously sick after a football game. Schuchat said this:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is one of the tragic parts of this epidemic. That people who are in the prime of their life, totally healthy, can suddenly become so sick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Totally healthy</strong>. This is the bigger delusion: That the average American who appears healthy is healthy. I believe that practically all Americans have grossly-impaired immunity. Their immune systems work much worse than they could. The poor performance is due to suboptimal sleep and far too little bacteria in their diet. The football player was near death because he had <strong>two </strong> out-of-control infections. That&#8217;s how poorly his immune system was working. And a top CDC official called him &#8220;totally healthy&#8221;! Apparently she has no idea that people&#8217;s immune systems can vary in how well they work. This is even worse than <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/09/02/infectious-disease-specialist-ignores-the-immune-system/">the UCLA medical school prof specializing in infectious disease who also failed to understand this</a>. Schuchat is one of the top public health officials in America! Public health is about prevention. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Schuchat">According to Wikipedia</a>, Schuchat &#8220;has emphasized prevention of infectious diseases in children.&#8221;</p>

					<p>In <a href="http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0091-6749/PIIS0091674907017678.pdf">a 2008 study</a>, researchers took fecal samples from 35 babies when they were one week old. They measured the diversity of bacteria in those samples. When the babies were 18 months old, they were divided into two groups: with (n = 15) and without (n = 20) atopic dermatitis, commonly called a rash. Atopic dermatitis is a sign of an oversensitive immune system. Children with this problem are more likely to have allergy problems when they are older. The 2008 study found that the babies with atopic dermatitis had less diverse fecal bacteria.</p>
<p>This is more evidence connecting lack of bacteria with immune problems.</p>

				<small>Monday, October 26th, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin">Jilin Province</a>, where it gets very cold in the winter, the older residents engage in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_swimming">winter swimming</a>. It&#8217;s good for their health, they say. Everyone knows this, a friend of mine who grew up there told me. On TV, she once saw an old woman say that she was having heart problems, but once she started winter swimming they got better.</p>
<p>When he was a grad student at Harvard, a friend of mine raised rats to be in learning experiments. He found that if he handled the rats &#8212; stressing them, essentially &#8212; they grew larger and healthier than unstressed rats.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/10/20/cosmic-radiation-makes-trees-grow-faster/">The cosmic ray effect I mentioned earlier</a> &#8212; that trees grow more when there is more cosmic radiation &#8212; occurred with older trees but not younger trees.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever designed an experiment, you know that both the treatment and the measurement need to be neither too high nor too low. With the treatment, that&#8217;s obvious. I suspect all three of these phenomena are examples of positioning the measurement appropriately. They suggest that everyone needs some sort of stress to be in the best health, but only in certain situations is it easy to see this.</p>
