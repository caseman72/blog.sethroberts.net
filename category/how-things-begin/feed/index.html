				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/03/23/why-do-sweet-foods-taste-good-the-importance-of-a-simple-observation/#comment-1179169" target="_blank">dearime asks:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Why do people fuss so much about paleo life? The population has grown so much since that it’s easy to believe that we’ve evolved a long way from then.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jared Diamond wrote a paper about rapid evolution on an isolated island. When modern (factory) food was introduced to the island (in the 1940s?), there was a very high rate of diabetes, presumably due to the new food. Since then, the rate of diabetes on the island has gone way down, although they still eat modern food. Diamond took this to be due to evolution (people with diabetes-resistant genes had more offspring), supporting dearime&#8217;s point of view.</p>
<p>After the first Ancestral Health Symposium, Melissa McEwen commented how unhealthy many of the top people looked. On the other hand, Tucker Max commented how healthy the attendees looked in general. I agree with both observations. A paradox.</p>
<p>When I was an assistant professor, and wanted to sleep better, I believed wondering about paleo life was unhelpful because (a) we knew so little about it and (b) it must have differed in thousands of ways from modern life. Should I spend an hour trying to find out about paleo life and/or what paleo gurus recommend for bad sleep? Or should I spend an hour trying to find out how ordinary people have improved their sleep? My answer was the latter. I ignored paleo life.</p>
<p>Looking into how ordinary people improved their sleep did help. I eventually reached a non-trivial conclusion: Eating breakfast made my sleep worse. No paleo guru had said that &#8212; I had been right to ignore them. Yet it made evolutionary sense. Cavemen did not eat breakfast, I was pretty sure. (No refrigerators.) After that I paid more attention to what evolutionary thinking would suggest. This led to <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">several discoveries</a>: the effect of faces in the morning on mood, the effect of standing on sleep, and the Shangri-La Diet. It is incredibly hard to discover big new experimental effects (such as the effect of morning faces), especially in fields you know little about (my specialty in psychology was animal learning, not mood, sleep or weight control). I was impressed.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">The effect of bedtime honey</a> (more generally sweets in the evening) on sleep emphasizes the paradox or puzzle or whatever you call it. I found out about the honey effect by paying attention to what works. No paleo involved. Stuart King told me it improved his sleep. Here are three reasons to look at ordinary experience and avoid paleo theorists: 1. It turned out to help. 2. It&#8217;s a huge effect and very easy. 3. Paleo theorists have said the opposite: avoid carbs, avoid sugar. If you followed their advice, you would do the opposite of what helped Stuart and me. On the other hand, I increased my belief in the effect because it made evolutionary sense: 1. It makes sense of why we like sweets. 2. It makes sense of why our liking for sweets goes down when we are hungry (surely due to an evolved mechanism). 3. It makes sense of why we eat sweets more in the evening (presumably due to an evolved mechanism that makes sweets taste better in the evening).</p>
<p>The short answer to dearime&#8217;s question is that, in my experience, it is incredibly hard to learn anything about health. There are so many possibilities and evolutionary thinking helps choose among them &#8212; decide which to take the trouble to test.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ed Rickards, a retired lawyer and journalist, writes <a href="http://dukecheck.com/" target="_blank">Duke Check</a>, a blog about Duke University, which I enjoy reading even though I have no connection with Duke. It emphasizes scandals and bad governance but also <a href="http://dukecheck.com/?p=16535" target="_blank">praises</a>. He started it in 2009. There have been plenty of scandals since then, including <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57376073/deception-at-duke-fraud-in-cancer-care/" target="_blank">the Anil Potti cancer research fraud</a>.</p>
<p>I recently asked him a few questions.<span id="more-11630"></span></p>
<p><strong>Why did you start Duke Check?</strong></p>
<p>I started DukeCheck &#8212; originally Duke Fact Checker &#8212; because of a lack of transparency and accountability on the part of the school&#8217;s administration. You may want to review <a href="http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2011/10/25/fact-checker-story-universitys-unorthodox-critic" target="_blank">this Chronicle profile</a>, especially the comments from the late law professor John (Jack) Johnston, about the need for such a column and my goals. I want to provide stakeholders in Duke &#8212; students, parents, faculty, alumni, workers, everyone &#8212; with the information so that they can participate and have their thoughts count. I really do not care if they agree with me or not, just so long as they step forward.</p>
<p><strong>After you graduated from Duke, did you have further association with the school (e.g., worked there)?</strong></p>
<p>I graduated from Duke 1963 and Duke Law 1966.  No, I never worked for Duke or had any relationship other than alum. I continued to stay in touch, I wrote various letters about my feelings, but the internet is what opened it all up. and made it possible for me to write my blog from either NY (where I used to live) or Coconut Grove (dead of the winter).  I have recently closed up NY and live near Princeton NJ . . . on a golf course which is a big switch.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been a professional writer?</strong></p>
<p>After brief flirtation with the law, and a job in private equity that was totally boring, I returned to my first love, Journalism, which attracted me while I was in college, and also during the summers when I worked for a local daily newspaper in my hometown.  I have worked at the Associated Press, ABC, CBS and NBC, so I have been all around!</p>
<p><strong>[This makes Duke Check a super-hobby -- combining the freedom of a hobby with the skills of a professional. This blog, too, is a super-hobby.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Duke has just opened a campus in China, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunshan" target="_blank">Kunshan</a>, which is near Shanghai. The campus is called Duke Kunshan University (DKU). Does the DKU story point to/illustrate any general lesson(s)?</strong></p>
<p>The DKU story will end with an empty campus in Kunshan. Many colleges have hit brick walls with their international adventures and this will be another. 15 years ago, Duke was gung-ho to open in Frankfurt; our president at the time, Nan Keohane, held an international news conference linked by satellite with reporters asking questions in Durham, NY, and Frankfurt.  Six years, $15 to 20 million later, it died.</p>
<p>Duke should pursue international opportunities; but trying to export bricks and mortar to China will not fly. For one thing, academic freedom is a very strong tradition at Duke, and no Chinese leader will tolerate it. The new campus cannot teach nor allow religious services. We were founded by Quakers and Methodists.</p>
<p>We also see our administration going overboard on finances. At a time when money is tight, unbelievably tight, we&#8217;re exporting green like mad. The numbers do not add up: number of students, amount we can charge them. This may well be the first thing to implode, academic freedom the 2nd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big public works projects inevitably cost far more than the original budget. I heard a talk about this a few years ago. The speaker gave many examples, including Boston&#8217;s Big Dig. His explanation was that these projects would not be approved if voters were told the truth. The German <del>newspaper</del> magazine <em>Der </em><em>Spiegel</em> has just published <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/de-meuron-von-gerkan-and-ingenhoven-on-german-construction-headaches-a-905472.html" target="_blank">an interview with several architects</a> responsible for recent German projects with especially large discrepancies between what people were told at the beginning and the unfolding reality &#8212; Berlin&#8217;s new airport, for example. The article&#8217;s headline calls them &#8220;debacles&#8221;. One architect gives the same explanation as the speaker I heard: &#8220;The pure truth doesn&#8217;t get you far in this business. The opera house in Sydney would never have been approved if they had known how much it would cost from the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree. I see the same massive underestimation of time and effort in projects that I do and that my colleagues and friends do, projects we do for ourselves that require no one&#8217;s approval. I think something will take an hour. It takes five hours. Plainly the world is more complicated than our mental model of it, sure, but there is more to it than that. Someone did a survey of people in Maryland who had been in a car accident so bad they had had to go to the hospital. Within only a year, a large fraction of them (half?) had forgotten about it. When asked if within the last year they had had an accident so bad they were hospitalized, they said no. Apparently we forget difficulties, even extreme ones, really fast. If you forget difficulties, you will underestimate them.</p>
<p><em>If I had realized how difficult everything would be, I couldn&#8217;t have done any of it</em> is one explanation, which I&#8217;ve heard attributed to Gregory Bateson. From <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2013/06/24/130624crbo_books_gladwell" target="_blank">Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s excellent review</a> in this week&#8217;s <em>New Yorker</em> of a biography of Albert Hirschman, the economist, I learned that Hirschman &#8212; had he realized that this was human nature &#8212; would have had a different evolutionary explanation: We underestimate difficulties because this way of thinking increases innovation. <span style="font-size: 13px;">Debacle . . . or opportunity? </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">Difficulty is the mother of invention. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was curious <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/11/how-things-begin-tisano-tea/" target="_blank">how Tisano Tea began</a> (yesterday&#8217;s post) because it was an unusual product (chocolate tea). There wasn&#8217;t any point I was trying to make. At a party last night, however, I found myself talking to the daughter of a diplomat (Tisano Tea was started by the son of a diplomat). I told her the story of Tisano Tea. And I couldn&#8217;t help pointing out two generalizations it supports:</p>
<p>1. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/scientific-method/insideroutsider/" target="_blank">blogged many times</a> about the value of insider/outsiders &#8212; people who have the knowledge of insiders but the freedom of outsiders. Patrick Pineda, the founder of Tisano Tea, was not an insider/outsider but he connected two worlds &#8212; the United States and Venezuela (in particular poor Venezuelan farmers) &#8212; that are rarely connected.</p>
<p>2. When people from rich countries try to help people in poor countries, the usual approach is to bring something from the rich country to the poor country. Nutritional knowledge, medicine, dams, and so on. One Laptop Per Child is an extreme example. Microcredit is <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/12/17/best-books-of-the-year-2012/" target="_blank">a deceptively attractive example</a>. In recent years, the flaws in this approach have become more apparent and there has been a shift toward local solutions to problems (e.g., the best ideas to help Uganda will come from Ugandans and those who have lived there a long time). Tisano Tea illustrates something that people in rich countries have had an even harder time imagining: <em>people in a poor country (Venezuela) knew something that improved life in a rich country (the United States) &#8212; </em>namely, that you can make tea from cacao husks. A small thing, but not trivial (maybe chocolate tea supplies important nutrients). An American desire for Venezuelan cacao husks improves life in Venezuela. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/magazine/the-food-truck-business-stinks.html?ref=magazine&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Ethnic food trucks</a> are a more subtle example.  When immigrants from poor countries manage to make a living in a rich country &#8212; using knowledge of their own cuisine is a good way to do this &#8212; they often send money home. As far as I know, this possibility has been ignored in development studies.</p>
<p>My research, which shows how a non-expert can do research that teaches something to experts, is related to the second generalization. For example, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">my research on faces and mood</a> has something to teach experts on depression and bipolar disorder. Although the term &#8220;home remedy&#8221; is standard, and lots of non-experts have improved their health in ways not approved by doctors, I have never heard a health expert show a realization that this could happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://tisano.com/" target="_blank">Tisano Tea</a>, based in San Francisco, sells chocolate tea. It was started in 2010 by Patrick Pineda, Leonardo Zambrano, and Lucas Azpurua. I was curious about the company because I like two chocolate tea blends very much: Red Cloud Cacao (a black tea/chocolate tea blend from Peet’s, no longer available but they will bring it back) and CocoMate (from <a href="http://www.americantearoom.com/" target="_blank">American Tea Room</a>).<span id="more-10390"></span></p>
<p>Patrick’s father was an ambassador from Venezuela. Patrick grew up in California and England and went to college at the University of East Anglia. After studying for a Master’s in Film Production from Columbia University (New York), he started working for Al Jazerra in Venezuela making documentaries. He also worked for a local TV station making segments for a children’s program. One segment was about cacao. He learned that Venezuelan cacao beans were among the most highly-valued cacao beans in the world. The cacao beans from one valley (Chuao) sold for ten times the usual price.</p>
<p>While making the segment, he met cacao farmers. He discovered a group of cacao farmers whose beans had been organically certified by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) due to local NGO sponsorship (the NGO paid for it). The farmers saw it as free training. The organic certification took lots of paperwork to maintain. The farmers had hoped that the certification would allow them to sell their beans at a premium. However, after four years, this hadn’t yet happened. At the end of each harvest, they’d had to sell their beans at the conventional (non-organic) price.</p>
<p>This struck Patrick as an opportunity – a niche (organic) within a niche (Venezualan). In the US, there was a growing demand for organic products. The co-op grew about 16 metric tons of organic cacao beans each year. In 2009, with the financial help of his older brother and friends, he bought 10 metric tons ($40,000). A month earlier, he hadn’t known that chocolate comes from cacao.</p>
<p>He soon realized there was a problem: How to get it out of the country? If taken straight out, the government would fumigate it and it would lose its organic certification. It would have to be processed in Venezuela. There were several cacao processing plants in Venezuela but to them 10 metric tons was nothing. Patrick finally convinced one of them that organic might be the future. He taught the employees how to process the beans organically while learning it himself. After that it was relatively easy to get the processing plant certified organic.</p>
<p>During processing, 12% of the weight is “lost” in shells that are normally discarded. Patrick took the shells with him back to America hoping he could do something with them. In Venezuela, he had met an indigenous tribal community that drank tea made from cacao shells as remedy for asthma and to sooth coughs. He looked academic journals for other uses. He eventually found about 120 published papers. The shells had been used as toothpaste and to increase the Vitamin D content of milk by feeding them to cows. The only common uses, it turned out, were as fertilizer (due to the nitrogen content) and animal feed (due to the fiber and Vitamin D content). Neither use was high-price.</p>
<p>What about tea? Patrick sent samples to his partners. They were unenthusiastic. “This tastes like grass. Why would anybody drink tea from a by-product?” However, he was selling chocolate butter and nibs online. With each order, he included an 8-ounce pouch of cacao shells with instructions how to brew the tea. His customers – at least, some of them – were enthusiastic: <em>How unique, how great</em>, they emailed him. A German woman said she hadn’t drunk such tea since World War II ended. During World War II, cacao shells had been added to tea to extend it. His customers wanted to buy more.</p>
<p>He convinced his partners to go to a trade show. In 2010, they went to Expo West, a natural and healthy food product show in Anaheim. Out of all of their products, the tea got the most attention. It won Best in Show for tea. Out of about 500 new products, it was one of four that won Best New Product of Show. People from Twinings Tea and Stash Tea complimented them on their product.</p>
<p>After the trade show, Patrick decided the tea was a good concept and decided to make it a separate brand. Dark chocolate without the guilt. No sugar, no caffeine. He launched Tisano. The name comes from <em>tisane</em> (herbal tea in French) and <em>artesano</em> (artisanal in Spanish).</p>
<p>When I tasted Tisano’s chocolate tea, it tasted very familiar. That’s because Tisano’s cacao shells are the cacao shells in both American Tea Room’s CocoMate and Peet’s Red Cloud Cacao. There is no doubt that Patrick has created a new niche within the American (and maybe world) tea market: chocolate tea. I don’t know how well CocoMate is selling at American Tea Room but I decided to buy it after smelling maybe 40 teas. At Peet’s, Red Cloud Cacao sold surprisingly well and they will bring it back seasonally.</p>

When it came time to apply to graduate school, she decided she wanted to work on something important. Energy was important. <span style="font-size: 13px;">She had read and admired</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">The Limits to Growth</em><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">(1972). </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">We are running out of convenient fossil fuels</em><span style="font-size: 13px;">, she thought. We are running out of other things, too, such as arable land and aquifers, but solving these problems would require energy. </span></p>
<p>She decided to go to Princeton and study plasma physics, hoping to improve fusion technology. It was not what she expected. Her professors were brilliant, working on exciting things, such as compact magnetic confinement devices. In the background, however, “everyone’s jumping through hoops,” she says. Her professors were constantly writing grants. Their grant proposals were hard to understand. They went to “dark and foreboding” federal organizations, where they were misunderstood. Funding was cut “randomly and mercilessly” by forces outside the professors’ control. Among the graduate students, she found &#8220;a cadre&#8221; of interesting people but most of them, she thought, were overly concerned with finding something that had not been done before that meshed with a professor&#8217;s interest, in contrast to doing something important that they themselves found interesting. She also thought the other graduate students were not concerned enough with foundational questions. There were &#8220;too many good soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Why rely on political whims I can’t control when I can create my own fortune and fund whatever research I want</em>, she thought. If you were a mediocre physicist at any top graduate school, you could go to Wall Street and become a quant or go to Silicon Valley and build stuff. In 2007, she talked to Wall Street quants. “I was studying their derivative and option pricing theories,” says Danielle. “They assumed that price was given by an infinite series of small independent factors.” The independence assumption struck her as unlikely because much of the market relied on the same pricing theory. “This foundational assumption was poorly founded,” she says. <em>It works</em>, the quants said. The market collapsed three months later. Before it did, she decided to leave Princeton (after two years) and go to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>She moved to the Bay Area and started couch surfing. During her first year there, she worked on several different projects with different cofounders and consulted for a variety of startups. Her &#8220;theory&#8221; was that she would learn how things work and find the right thing to do. She met Paul Graham and consulted for Y Combinator companies. She realized her “limiting factor” – what she needed the most – was a good co-founder. “Innovation is social,” she says. David McIntosh, a co-founder of Redux Games, “read [her] blog” and put her in touch with Max Crane. Max Crane is Steve Crane’s son. Steve was helping someone else start a video game company in Petaluma that needed a part-time programmer. Danielle was living in San Francisco at the time. Steve offered her the job and offered to drive her to Petaluma. “Every time we would drive up we would talk about different ideas,” said Danielle. “I had 50 different ideas for startups.” The one she kept coming back to, kept thinking about, was making a compressed-air-powered vehicle.</p>
<p>A friend, Nick Pilon, had asked her, &#8220;How far can you drive with the [solar] energy you could collect on a garage roof in a day? Is it enough to handle the average American commute?&#8221; To answer this, she had to provide a solution to the problem of making a practical, efficient vehicle. Batteries were a serious problem. They are expensive, heavy, and degrade relatively fast. Better energy storage would make a solar-powered vehicle more plausible. Several years earlier, her dad had sent her a link about a car that ran on compressed air. In that case, the CEO had been arrested for fraud. The car didn’t exist. However, MDI International in France had made some progress. (Well before <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2266632/Car-runs-air-coming-soon-Peugeot-Citroen-unveil-new-117mpg-hybrid.html" target="_blank">Peugeot</a>.) She suggested this possibility to Steve. It could be very inexpensive and fast to refill. They could make a scooter. Steve got really excited. “I’d love to help you get this funded,” he told Danielle. Eventually he put in $100,000 and joined Danielle as a co-founder. He left his other jobs to work with her.</p>
<p>The thermodynamics of air compression were discouraging. (So much so that in 2009 Berkeley researchers published <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/4/4/044011/" target="_blank">a paper</a> arguing that a compressed-air vehicle would not be viable any time soon. &#8220;The BEV [battery electric vehicle] outperforms the compressed-air car [CAC] in every category. Uncertainty in technology specifications is considerably higher for CACs than for BEVs, adding a risk premium.&#8221;) When air is compressed, it gets hot &#8212; and heat may leak away. When air expands, it cools &#8212; and cold air provides little pressure. Danielle realized that you could solve both problems by adding heat capacity to the air. This could be done by adding water (mist) during compression to absorb heat and using the stored heat to warm the air during expansion. If you could continuously supply the expanding air with heat, efficiency would increase from the low 20s to 70-85%. Such an engine – driven by compressed air – would be cheaper, lighter, and more powerful.</p>
<p>They spoke to Ed Berlin (whom Steve called “the most brilliant inventor I know&#8221;). Coincidentally, Ed had been working on a compressed-air hybrid vehicle. They joined forces. Ed introduced them to Keith McCurdy, who advised them about financing. At a party, Keith told Vinod Kholsa, the venture capitalist, about the idea. This led to a meeting with Ford Tamer, one of Kholsa&#8217;s partners, who specialized in two-wheeled vehicles. He was more excited about what they could do for the power grid (by storing excess power during times of low demand). They had a whole PowerPoint presentation about vehicles. They scrapped it and made another one.</p>
<p>Steve and Ed built the first prototype. Danielle measured its performance. “Ed had a machine shop in his garage and knew how to use it,” says Danielle.</p>
<p>An especially important early hire (Employee Number 6) was Kevin Walter, who became Vice President of Development (developing the engine that compresses the air). <span style="font-size: 13px;">He had previously worked for one of the top racing car teams in the world and had developed many race-car engines.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">&#8220;We knew how to build engines in theory,&#8221; says Danielle, &#8220;but he had actually built them.&#8221; He knew, for example, where to drill holes so that oil would get to the right places. He also contributed a great deal of (psychic) energy, focus, and perseverance.</span></p>
<p>Being located in the Bay Area really helped. The Bay Area has many people (in the “low thousands”) who are good at making things. One LightSail employee (Liam McNamara) made a steam-powered automobile from scratch for Burning Man and won Junkyard Wars. Another (Keith Johnson) built electric cupcake cars and an electric pumpkin carriage. The Bay Area has “an atmosphere of possibility,” says Danielle. “The idea that when you have a great idea that is doable, you should do it. No one else is going to do it. Burning Man is a condensation of this. After people come, they feel they really can do something. And once they start, the deadline helps make sure they get it done.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">this essay</a>, which I learned about from <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/03/at-the-frontier-of-personalized-medicine.html">Alex Tabarrok</a>, Paul Graham complains about email. Too easy for someone to send him email. Also slow. He thinks of email as a todo list. Here&#8217;s what he wants:</p>
<blockquote><p>More restrictions on what someone can put on my todo list. And when someone can put something on my todo list, I want them to tell me more about what they want from me. Do they want me to do something beyond just reading some text? How important is it? (There obviously has to be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is important.) When does it have to be done?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I want: <strong>A price per email</strong>. A service that charges people for each email they send me (e.g., $1/email). I get most of the price, the company providing the service gets a small percentage (1%?). With two additional features: 1. The initial charge is just for me to look at it. Then, after I read the email, there is a mechanism that allows me to easily charge more to do what they ask, such as give them Shangri-La Diet advice. 2. I can easily put people on a list that allows them to send me email for free.</p>
<p>Since Google already has Google Checkout, it might be relatively easy for them to add this to gmail.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>At the recent Fancy Food Show in San Francisco, the most impressive product I encountered was a honey wine vinegar made by <a href="http://www.slideridgehoney.com/">Slide Ridge Honey</a>, a small family business in northern Utah. I interviewed the developer, Martin James, about how the business and product began.</em></p>
<p><strong> How did your business begin?<span id="more-5478"></span></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I started keeping bees when I was 9 years old. It was a hobby. When I was in my thirties, I wanted to start a business. I&#8217;d been doing flooring. Carpet, linoleum, that sort of thing. Large commercial jobs and residential. I wanted to be my own boss, control my own destination, have my own business. I started a honey business with my two sisters, one older, one  younger.That was 10 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>How did this product begin?</strong></p>
<p>We wanted a more unique product. We wanted to expand beyond Utah. When you ship butter somewhere, it&#8217;s already there &#8212; local honey. So it&#8217;s hard to enter the market. We wanted to diversify our business so we weren&#8217;t only selling honey. We wanted higher profit margins.</p>
<p>My sisters and I discussed lots of possible products. Eventually vinegar came out the favorite. There are only two other people making honey wine vinegar &#8212; one in Washington State (Honey Ridge Farms), the other in Italy. If you put our products side by side, you&#8217;ll see they&#8217;re totally different.</p>
<p>The development took 7 years. The first step was to use honey to make wine. I got yeasts from wine shops, brewing shops, and mail order. I needed to find a yeast that was compatible with honey. The first ones I tried produced off flavors &#8212; for example, the wine smelled like gasoline. I finally found a yeast that was compatible with honey, that made an excellent honey wine. The next step was <a href="http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2008-12/making-vinegar-home">to produce vinegar</a>. To do that I used an acetobacter &#8212; a microbe that eats alcohol and makes acid. It feels like piece of wet leather. What kombucha makers call a scooby. I found the acetobacter I needed from a vinegar maker in Napa Valley &#8212; a vinegar maker.</p>
<p>There was also four years of paperwork. Local, state, federal.</p>
<p><strong>What has surprised you?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The reception. When they taste it, people&#8217;s eyes light up. I hadn&#8217;t prepared myself for the product to take off so well. Repeat customers buy 3 bottles. A lot of specialty chefs have taken an interest. A lot of TV chefs have come by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sue Halpern has written the first interesting assessment of Steve Jobs I&#8217;ve seen, in the form of <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/jan/12/who-was-steve-jobs/?pagination=false">a book review of Isaacson&#8217;s biography</a>. It happens to be very negative. She says little about his now-well-known bad treatment of coworkers, friends and family (&#8220;a bully, a dissembler, a cheapskate, a deadbeat dad, a manipulator&#8221;) and focusses on the effects of Apple Computer, which are obviously much greater.</p>
<p>She makes one very bad point. He should not call himself an artist, she argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no doubt that the products Steve Jobs brilliantly conceived of and oversaw at Apple were elegant and beautiful, but they were, in the end, products. Artists, typically, aim to put something of enduring beauty into the world; consumer electronics companies aim to sell a lot of gadgets, manufacturing desire for this year’s model in the hope that people will discard last year’s.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In the end, products&#8221;? &#8220;Gadgets&#8221;? Are books gadgets? I cannot imagine a future without books. Nor one without cellphones and laptops. If they are lovely and work well, so much the better for all of us.  Moreover, cellphones and laptops, much more than other necessities (food, clothes, housing, transportation, medicine) help us express ourselves &#8212; our hidden inner selves &#8212; in so many ways. (Like art and books, but better.) Mark Fraunfelder <a href="http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111006/stories-about-steve/slides/14">made a similar point</a> (obliquely).</p>
<p>&#8220;Products&#8221; and &#8220;gadgets&#8221; is Halpern&#8217;s conventional anti-consumerism. She goes on to make two equally conventional but much better points:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a study reported by Bloomberg News last January, Apple ranked at the very bottom of twenty-nine global tech firms “in terms of responsiveness and transparency to health and environmental concerns in China.” Yet walking into the Foxconn factory, where people routinely work six days a week, from early in the morning till late at night standing in enforced silence, Steve Jobs might have entered his biggest reality distortion field of all. “You go into this place and it’s a factory but, my gosh, they’ve got restaurants and movie theaters and hospitals and swimming pools,” he said after being queried by reporters about working conditions there shortly after a spate of suicides. “For a factory, it’s pretty nice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple had (and has) the power to improve working conditions at Foxconn. I completely agree: this was (and is) an enormous missed opportunity, for which Steve Jobs is completely responsible. No doubt he said that Apple products empower individuals (and they do) &#8212; well, how about empowering Foxconn workers?</p>
<p>Halpern&#8217;s final point is about recycling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Next year will bring the iPhone 5, and a new MacBook, and more iPods and iMacs. What this means is that somewhere in the third world, poor people are picking through heaps of electronic waste in an effort to recover bits of gold and other metals and maybe make a dollar or two. Piled high and toxic, it is leaking poisons and carcinogens like lead, cadmium, and mercury that leach into their skin, the ground, the air, the water. Such may be the longest-lasting legacy of Steve Jobs’s art.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Apple could (and can) lead the world in making their products easy to recycle. They haven&#8217;t. Entirely Steve Jobs&#8217; fault. As Halpern says, this really matters.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs spent his working life (a) exploiting the commercial potential of new products (home computer, etc.) in large part by (b) caring obsessively, much more than others in his rarefied position, such as Bill Gates, about how they made him feel. Apple made products that Steve Jobs enjoyed. Fine. The problem is what Steve Jobs enjoyed. My take on him is a lot can be explained by (a) he cared little what others thought of him and (b) he lived in a tiny, uncomplicated intellectual world &#8212; as illustrated by his remarks about Foxconn and his Stanford graduation speech. Nabokov might say he had the emotional development of a child and the curiosity of an adult.</p>
<p>He left behind a company that reflects the shallowness of what he cared about. Those who take over Apple Computer are likely to be less shallow than he was &#8212; most people are. I predict the company will begin to care more about working conditions, ease of recycling, and other things beyond immediate user experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://bacteriality.com/2008/04/13/wolcott/">this interview</a>, a doctor who does research on biofilms named Randall Wolcott makes the same point <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/06/testing-treatments-eight-questions-for-the-authors/">I made about <em>Testing Treatments</em></a> &#8212; that evidence-based medicine, as now practiced, suppresses innovation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I take it you [meaning the interviewer] are familiar with evidence-based medicine? It’s the increasingly accepted approach for making clinical decisions about how to treat a patient. Basically, doctors are trained to make a decision based on the most current evidence derived from research. But what such thinking boils down to [in practice -- theory is different] is that I am supposed to do the same thing that has always been done – to treat my patient in the conventional manner – just because it’s become the most popular approach. However, when it comes to chronic wound biofilms, we are in the midst of a crisis – what has been done and is accepted as the standard treatment doesn’t work and doesn’t meet the needs of the patient.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thus, evidence-based medicine totally regulates against innovation. Essentially doctors suffer if they step away from mainstream thinking. Sure, there are charlatans out there who are trying to sell us treatments that don’t work, but there are many good therapies that are not used because they are unconventional. It is only by considering new treatment options that we can progress.</p>
<p>Right on. He goes on to say that he is unwilling to do a double-blind clinical trial in which some patients do not receive his new therapy because &#8220;we know we’ve got the methods to save most of their limbs&#8221; from amputation.</p>
<p>Almost all scientific and intellectual history (and much serious journalism) is about how things begin. How ideas began and spread, how inventions are invented. If you write about Steve Jobs, for example, that&#8217;s your real subject. How things <strong>fail</strong> to begin &#8212; how good ideas are killed off &#8212; is at least as important, but much harder to write about. This is why <a href="www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Tyler Cowen&#8217;s <em>The Great Stagnation</em></a> is such an important book. It says nothing about the killing-off processes, but at least it describes the stagnation they have caused. Stagnation should scare us. As Jane Jacobs often said, if it lasts long enough, it causes collapse.</p>
<p>Thanks to Heidi.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/03/vitamin-d-sunlight-and-sleep-more/#comment-930611">this comment</a> (thanks, <a href="http://www.elizabethmolin.com/">Elizabeth Molin</a>) I learned of a British book called <em>Testing Treatments</em> (<a href="http://www.testingtreatments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TT-interactive-optimised.pdf">pdf</a>), whose second edition has just come out. Its goal is to make readers more sophisticated consumers of medical research. To help them distinguish &#8220;good&#8221; science from &#8220;bad&#8221; science. Ben Goldacre, the Bad Science columnist, <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2011/10/new-edition-of-testing-treatments-best-lay-text-on-evidence-based-medicine/">fulsomely praises it</a> (&#8220;I genuinely, truly, cannot recommend this awesome book highly enough for its clarity, depth, and humanity&#8221;). He wrote a foreword. The main text is by Imogen Evans (medical journalist), Hazel Thornton (writer),  Iain Chalmers (medical researcher), and Paul Glaziou (medical researcher, editor of <em>Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine</em>).</p>
<p>To me, as I&#8217;ve said, medical research is almost entirely bad. Almost all medical researchers accept two remarkable rules: (a) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/09/18/first-let-them-get-sick/"><strong>first, let them get sick</strong></a> and (b) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/29/no-cheap-remedies/"><strong>no cheap remedies</strong></a>. These rules severely limit what is studied. In terms of useful progress, the price of these limits has been enormous: near total enfeeblement. For many years the Nobel Prize in Medicine has documented the continuing failure of medical researchers all over the world to make significant progress on all major health problems, including depression, heart disease, obesity, cancer, diabetes, stroke, and so on. It is consistent with their level of understanding that some people associated with medicine would write a book about how to do something (good science) the whole field manifestly can&#8217;t do. <em>Testing Treatments</em> isn&#8217;t just a fat person writing a book about how to lose weight, it&#8217;s the author failing to notice he&#8217;s fat.<span id="more-4458"></span></p>
<p>In case the lesson of the Nobel Prizes isn&#8217;t clear, here are some questions for the authors:</p>
<p>1. Why no chapter on prevention research? To fail to discuss prevention, which should be <strong>at least</strong> half of health care, at length is like writing a book using only half the letters of the alphabet. The authors appear unaware they have done so.</p>
<p>2. Why are practically all common medical treatments expensive?</p>
<p>3. Why should some data be ignored (&#8220;clear rules are followed, describing where to look for evidence, what evidence can be included&#8221;)? The &#8220;systematic reviews&#8221; that Goldacre praises here (p. 12) may ignore 95% of available data.</p>
<p>4. The book says: &#8220;Patients with life-threatening conditions can be desperate to try anything, including untested ‘treatments’. But it is far better for them to consider enrolling in a suitable clinical trial in which a new treatment is being compared with the current best treatment.&#8221; Really? Perhaps an ancient treatment (to authors, untested) would be better. Why are there never clinical trials that compare current treatments (e.g., drugs) to ancient treatments? The ancient treatments, unlike the current ones, have passed the test of time. (The authors appear unaware of this test.) Why is the comparison always one relatively new treatment versus another even newer treatment?</p>
<p>5. Why does all the research you discuss center on reducing symptoms rather than discovering underlying causes? Isn&#8217;t the latter vastly more helpful than the former?</p>
<p>6. In a discussion of how to treat arthritis (pp. 170-172), why no mention of omega-3? Many people (with <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/">good reason</a>, including <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/04/flaxseed-oil-heals-bleeding-gums-again/#comment-930756">this</a>) consider omega-3 anti-inflammatory. Isn&#8217;t inflammation a major source of disease?</p>
<p>7. Why is there nothing about how to make your immune system work better? Why is this topic absent from the examples?  The immune system is mentioned only once (&#8220;Bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, which are associated with the children’s weakened immune system, are a common cause of death [in children with AIDS]&#8220;).</p>
<p>8. Care to defend what you say about &#8220;ghostwriting&#8221; (where med school professors are the stated authors of papers they didn&#8217;t write)? You say ghostwriting is when &#8220;a professional writer writes text that is officially credited to someone else&#8221; (p. 124). <strong>Officially</strong> credited? Please explain. You also say &#8220;ghostwritten material appears in academic publications too – and with potentially worrying consequences&#8221; (p. 124). <strong>Potentially </strong>worrying consequences? You&#8217;re not sure?</p>
<p>9. Have you ever discovered a useful treatment? No such discoveries are described in &#8220;About the Authors&#8221; nor does the main text contain examples. If not, why do you think you know how?  If you&#8217;re just repeating what others have said, why do you think your teachers are capable of useful discovery? The authors dedicate the book to someone &#8220;who encouraged us repeatedly to challenge authority.&#8221; Did you ever ask your teachers for evidence that evidence-based medicine is an improvement?</p>
<p>The sad irony of <em>Testing Treatments</em> is that it glorifies evidence-based medicine. According to that line of thinking, doctors should ask for evidence of effectiveness. They should not simply prescribe the conventional treatment. In a meta sense, the authors of <em>Testing Treatments</em> have made exactly the mistake that evidence-based medicine was supposed to fix: Failure to look at evidence. They have failed to see abundant evidence (e.g., the Nobel Prizes) that, better or not, evidence-based medicine is little use.</p>
<p>Above all, the authors of <em>Testing Treatments</em> and the architects of evidence-based medicine have failed to ask: How do new ideas begin? How can we encourage them? Healthy science is more than hypothesis testing; it includes hypothesis generation &#8212; and therefore includes methods for doing so. What are those methods? By denigrating and ignoring and telling others to ignore what they call &#8220;low-quality evidence&#8221; (e.g., case studies), the architects of evidence-based medicine have stifled the growth of new ideas. Ordinary doctors cannot do double-blind clinical trials. Yet they can gather data. They can write case reports. They can do n=1 experiments. They can do n=8 experiments (&#8220;case series&#8221;). There are millions of ordinary doctors, some very smart and creative (e.g., <a href="http://jackkruse.com/">Jack Kruse</a>). They are potentially a great source of new ideas about how to improve health. By denigrating what ordinary doctors can do (the evidence they can collect) &#8212; not to mention what the rest of us can do &#8212; and by failing to understand innovation, the architects of evidence-based medicine have made a bad situation (the two rules I mentioned earlier) even worse. They have further reduced the ability of the whole field to innovate, to find practical solutions to common problems.</p>
<p>Evidence-based medicine is religion-like in its emphasis on hierarchy (grades of evidence) and rule-following. In the design of religions, these features made sense (to the designers). You want unquestioning obedience (followers must not question leaders) and you want the focus to be on procedure (rules and rituals) rather than concrete results. Like many religions, evidence-based medicine draws lines (on this side &#8220;good&#8221;, on that side &#8220;bad&#8221;) where no lines actually exist. Such line-drawing helps religious leaders because it allows their followers to feel superior to someone (to people outside their religion). When it comes to science, however, these features make things worse. Good ideas can come from anybody, high or low in the hierarchy, on either side of any line. And every scientist comes to realize, if they didn&#8217;t already know, that you can&#8217;t do good science simply by following rules. It is harder than that. You have to pay close attention to what happens and be flexible. Evidence-based medicine is the opposite of flexible. &#8220;<a href="http://www.fotuva.org/feynman/what_is_science.html">There is considerable intellectual tyranny in the name of science</a>,&#8221; said Richard Feynman.</p>
<p><em>Testing Treatments</em> has plenty of stories. Here I agree with the authors &#8212; good stories. It&#8217;s the rest of the book that shows their misunderstanding. I would replace the book&#8217;s many pages of advice and sermonizing with a few simple words: <strong><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/08/29/suppose-you-write-the-times-to-fix-an-error-part-2/">Ask your doctor for the evidence behind their treatment recommendation</a>. He or she may not want to tell you. Insist. Don&#8217;t settle for vague banalities (&#8220;It&#8217;s good to catch these things early&#8221;). Don&#8217;t worry about being &#8220;difficult&#8221;.</strong> You won&#8217;t find this advice anywhere in <em>Testing Treatments</em>. If I wanted to help patients, I would find out what happens when it is followed.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> Two of the authors respond in the comments. And I comment on their response.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last four years or so I have daily measured how well my brain is working by means of balance measurements and mental tests. For three years  I have used a test of simple arithmetic (e.g, 7 * 8, 2 + 5). I try to answer as fast as possible. I take faster answers to indicate a better-functioning brain.</p>
<p>Yesterday my score was much better than usual. This shows what happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-10-30-arithmetic-outlier-day2.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4402" title="2011-10-30 arithmetic outlier day" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-10-30-arithmetic-outlier-day2-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>My usual average is about 550 msec or more; my score yesterday was 525 msec. An unexplained improvement of 25 msec. </p>
<p>What caused the improvement? I came up with a list of ways that yesterday was much different than usual, that is, was an outlier in other ways. These are possible causes. From more to less plausible:</p>
<p>1. I had 33 g extra flaxseed last night. (By mistake. I&#8217;m not sure about this.)</p>
<p>2. The test came at the perfect time after I had my afternoon yogurt with 33 g flaxseed. When I took flaxseed oil (now I eat ground flaxseed), it was clear that there was a short-term improvement for a few hours.</p>
<p>3. Many afternoons I eat 33 g ground flaxseed with yogurt. Yesterday I ground the afternoon flaxseed an unusually long time, making made the omega-3 more digestible.</p>
<p>4. I did kettlebells swings and a kettlebell walk about 2 hours before the test. These exercises are not new but usually I do them on different days. Yesterday was the first time I&#8217;ve done them on the same day. I&#8217;m sure ordinary walking improves performance for perhaps 30 minutes after I stop walking.</p>
<p>5. I had duck and miso soup a half-hour before the test. Almost never eat this.</p>
<p>6. I had a fermented egg (&#8220;thousand-year-old egg&#8221;) at noon. I rarely eat them.</p>
<p>7. I had peanuts with my yogurt and ground flaxseed. Peanuts alone seem to have no effect. Perhaps something in the peanuts improves digestion of the omega-3 in the flaxseed.</p>
<p>8. I started watching faces at 7 am that morning instead of 6:30 am or earlier.</p>
<p>Here are eight ideas to test. Perhaps one or two will turn out to be important. Perhaps none will.</p>
<p>After I made this list, I read student papers. The assignment was to comment on a research article. One of the articles was about the effect of holding a warm versus cold coffee cup. Holding a warm coffee cup makes you act &#8220;warmer,&#8221; said the article. Commenting on this, a student said she thought it was ridiculous until she remembered going to the barber. She sees the person who washes her hair (in warm water) as friendly, the barber as cold. Maybe this is due to the warm water used to wash her hair, she noted. This made me realize another unusual feature of yesterday: I had washed my hair in warm water longer than usual. I think I did it at least 30 minutes before the arithmetic test but I&#8217;m not sure. In any case, here is another idea to test. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/05/does-shower-temperature-affect-brain-speed/">I found earlier that cold showers slowed down my arithmetic speed</a>. </p>
<p>This illustrates a big advantage of personal science (science done for personal gain) over professional science (science done because it&#8217;s your job): The random variation in my life may suggest plausible new ideas. As far as I can tell, professional scientists have learned almost nothing about practical ways to make your brain work better. You can find many lists of &#8220;brain food&#8221; on the internet. Inevitably the evidence is weak. I&#8217;d be surprised if any of them helped more than a tiny amount (in my test, a few msec). The real brain foods, in my experience, are butter and omega-3. Perhaps my tests will merely confirm the value of omega-3 (Explanations 1-3). But perhaps not (Explanations 4-8 and head heating).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How did air-breathing evolve? In <em><a href="http://www.robertfulford.com/JacobsBusiness.html">The Nature of Economies</a></em> (p. 87), Jane Jacobs uses it to illustrate the developmental pattern she calls &#8220;bifurcation&#8221; (air-breathing isn&#8217;t a refinement of water-breathing). She speculates on how it started:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lungfish had both gills and a primitive lung, suggesting that their habitat was swampland. The earliest to take to dry land may have inhabited swamps subject to severe droughts or perhaps they were escaping fearsomely-jawed predators who couldn&#8217;t follow them to dry land.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Steve Yegge&#8217;s already-famous <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3101876">&#8220;psst, Googlers&#8221; memo</a>, something much like this was why Amazon started selling web computing services, which wasn&#8217;t a refinement of their earlier business (selling books, toys, etc.):</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon was a product company too, so it took an out-of-band force to make Bezos understand the need for a platform. That force was their evaporating margins; he was cornered and had to think of a way out. But all he had was a bunch of engineers and all these computers&#8230; if only they could be monetized somehow&#8230; you can see how he arrived at AWS [Amazon Web Services], in hindsight.</p></blockquote>
<p>People say <em>necessity is the mother of invention</em>. That isn&#8217;t even close to true. Trial and error is the mother of true, profound invention. The Bezos story, and Jacobs&#8217;s generalization of it, suggest what is actually true: <em>necessity is the mother of development</em>. Necessity pushes people to use, and thereby develop, inventions they had ignored.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Italian surgeon, Paolo Zamboni, claimed that he found low blood flow from the brain in 100% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). He began by studying his wife.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.canada.com/health/studies+still+uncertain+about+liberation+therapy/5494281/story.html#ixzz1ZkjxCmAc">A new study</a> supports the connection:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Canadian researchers analyzed eight studies from Italy, Germany, Jordan and the U.S. that involved 664 MS patients in total. The studies looked at how frequently CCSVI [chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency] was found in people with MS compared to healthy people or those with other neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>One of the studies — Zamboni&#8217;s — found CCSVI in 100 per cent of people with MS, and zero per cent of people without the disease. Other studies found the vein abnormalities in people who didn&#8217;t have MS.</p>
<p>Overall, when the results were combined, people with MS were 13.5 times more likely to have CCSVI. Even when the study by Zamboni — which generated the excitement about CCSVI — was removed, the syndrome was 3.7 times more common in people with MS.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We praise Google and Wikipedia for making knowledge more available &#8212; consider them two of the best innovations of the last 50 years &#8212; but after Aaron Swartz, a friend of mine, apparently tried to do the same thing <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jul/21/aaron-swartz-indicted-hacking-charges">he was charged with wire and computer fraud</a> and faces up to 35 years in jail and a $1 million fine.</p>
<p>The prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, made an interesting statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars. It is equally harmful to the victim whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my experience, tautological statements such as &#8220;stealing is stealing&#8221; or &#8220;correlation is <strong>not</strong> causation&#8221; do not bode well for that side of the argument. As Thorstein Veblen might say, the reason for the tautology was the need for it.</p>
<p>Ortiz&#8217;s statement shows that she, like the rest of us, thinks that what matters is amount of harm. Harm is hard to find here. The only clear harm is that MIT access to JSTOR was shut down for a few days. This is so minor that <a href="http://about.jstor.org/news-events/news/jstor-statement-misuse-incident-and-criminal-case">JSTOR&#8217;s statement about the case</a> (which includes &#8220;it was the government’s decision whether to prosecute, not JSTOR’s. . . . We [have] no interest in this becoming an ongoing legal matter&#8221;) doesn&#8217;t mention it. I don&#8217;t think many people will agree that this amount of harm justifies the charges that Ortiz has brought.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Time Out</em> magazine was started in 1968 in London by Tony Elliot, who was 22 at the time. The original title was <em>Where It&#8217;s At</em>. There were all sorts of new cultural stuff, such as a concert by the Who, that the mainstream media didn&#8217;t notice. The fringe-y alternative media weren&#8217;t interested in the attention to detail required to put out a list of events. That was the gap Time Out filled. Elliot borrowed a small amount of money (70 pounds) to start it. He and his co-workers worked without pay for the first three or four months. It was hard to get distribution, so they went around to parks passing it out. At a Beijing talk, Elliot said he didn&#8217;t remember the first paid advertiser (maybe a music store) but he did remember when he got an unsolicited advertising order from the prestigious <a href="http://www.londonfilmmuseum.com/">London Film Museum</a>. <em>They understand what we&#8217;re trying to do</em>, he thought.</p>
<p>I asked what some of his biggest mistakes had been. Both involved not saying no when he should have said no.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Better to light a candle than  curse the darkness, the saying goes. What if there are no candles?</p>
<p>Ken Rousseau, a software manager in Silicon Valley, went to Caltech  in the late 70s. He didn&#8217;t have a good time. He was a physics major He took a required course on electricity and magnetism where the average  score on the final was 15 out of 100. As he took  it, he thought, <em>I guess I can&#8217;t be a physics major</em>. He got  a 16 &#8212; a solid B. That a professor would design such a demoralizing test revealed,  he believed,  that the professor didn&#8217;t care about students. At Tech,  lack of caring for students was shown in big things and small. Every  building on campus was air-conditioned except the student houses, and  Pasadena gets really hot in the summer. The graduation rate around that  time &#8212; the fraction of entering students who graduate in four years  &#8212; was 59%. At MIT it was 80 or 90%. When a student drops out of Tech,  it&#8217;s a lost opportunity on both sides, Rousseau felt. It was/is very  difficult to get into Tech. To send 41% of admitted students away struck  him as a terrible thing.</p>
<p>He did graduate. For many years, when Tech would ask him for money,  he would say no, sometimes with a letter about why. But he kept in touch  with other students who had lived in the same undergraduate house  (Fleming House), one of the seven student houses. Every year, a bunch of them  would have a weekend-long beach party. At one of them the idea arose:  Let&#8217;s start a Fleming Fund. To help the students buy beer, that sort  of thing. Tech is a tough place, let&#8217;s help them get through it.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Rousseau got a letter from the president of Caltech that  made him angry. Tech was #4 in the <em>U.S. News</em> rankings, it said, mainly  because of the low fraction of alumni giving. Let&#8217;s make Tech #1 by  giving more, wrote the president. Rousseau responded with a five-page  letter that made one simple point: Alumni giving is so low because the  people in charge cared so little about students. Their lack of concern  is being reciprocated.</p>
<p>By 2003 or 2004 Rousseau had enough money that he got a personal visit  from the development office. His visitor knew his wife&#8217;s name, the approximate  ages of his children, and the high points of his professional career.  Rousseau told him of his residual bitterness. &#8220;You&#8217;ve obviously  benefited a lot from your Tech experience,&#8221; said the development  officer. &#8220;Why have you only given $163 over the years?&#8221; He  had it wrong, Rousseau said. He had given $1. His wife, who had also  gone to Tech, had given $162.</p>
<p>He told the development officer he was interested in helping Tech students  &#8212; particularly Fleming House residents. In essence, he wanted to bring  the Fleming Fund into existence. Around this time, Frank Bernstein,  another Caltech alum who was working as a patent attorney in Silicon  Valley, was also solicited. &#8220;Frank, I&#8217;m looking for a really significant  donation,&#8221; said the same development officer who had approached  Rousseau. Bernstein, who&#8217;d also lived in Fleming, told Rousseau about  the conversation and they again resurrected the idea of the Fleming  Fund.</p>
<p>The development officer came back to them with ideas. Maybe you could  fund a lecturer, he suggested. Or graduate student salaries. Helping  undergraduates was clearly a new and difficult concept for  the development office. They were looking for contributions that, in  their words, &#8220;directly benefited the Institute.&#8221; Bernstein  pointed out to them that this was a narrow and self-defeating view.  They want alumni to contribute. They want to get them in the habit of  contributing. A Fleming Fund will help with that.</p>
<p>Because Rousseau&#8217;s daughter, a high school student, was considering going to Tech, Rousseau visited the campus in 2006. He met with  Tom Mannion, the administrator for student affairs, and came to believe  that the administration cared more about students than they had in the  past. A new incoming president, Jean-Lou Chameau, appeared to genuinely care about undergrads. (Later events have validated that view.Â Chameau has made a point of discussing student life in his public discussions and has started to push administration officials to discuss what theyâ€™re doing with regards to student life.) After that, Rousseau and Bernstein met with  the development officer who had solicited them and started working on  the details. The Institute set a minimum of $100,000. Once the fund  reached this level, income from the fund would be given to the students  to spend.</p>
<p>In 2008 the details were hammered out. There would be two sort of restrictions:  1. Obvious limits on what the money could be spent on (no bail, no illegal  drugs, etc.). 2. An oversight committee of three people, including the  past president of Fleming House. The oversight committee only gets involved  when the amount of money is more than the house&#8217;s usual budget. The  income, at least at first, would be about $10,000 year for a house of  about 120 students.</p>
<p>In May 2009, the fund was announced during a Fleming House reunion dinner  at Tom Mannionâ€™s house. Many undergrads came up to Rousseau and told  him it was a &#8220;really cool idea.&#8221; They were touched that someone  out there cared about them. The Institute is thinking of repeating it  with the other student houses.</p>
