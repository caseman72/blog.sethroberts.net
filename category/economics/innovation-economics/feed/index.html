				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I wrote <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/04/13/burnt-sugar-grapefruit-give-thanks-for-south-korea/" target="_blank">my recent post about Korean innovation</a>, I noticed an example in downtown Berkeley. A few months ago, the Korean bakery Paris Baguette opened a branch in a good location (next to a BART station) that has seen two businesses &#8212; two different cafe chains &#8212; fail in the last 5 or 6 years. It seemed to be doing well. There were more customers than I&#8217;d ever seen with the previous business (Tully&#8217;s Coffee). <a href="http://www.parisbaguetteusa.com/" target="_blank">Paris Baguette</a> has about 20 American branches.</p>
<p>Jane Jacobs once called Berkeley a &#8220;pretentious suburb&#8221; but it is where Peet&#8217;s &#8212; the original of Starbucks &#8212; began and where Chez Panisse is. It had a farmer&#8217;s market and an emphasis on organic food long before the rest of America. (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/case-study/organic-food-doesn%E2%80%99t-lower-overall-cancer-risk" target="_blank">A new survey</a> suggests the health benefit of organic food is small or zero.) If you could call a location an &#8220;early adopter&#8221; Berkeley would qualify, but that would be understating it. Via the Free Speech Movement and the whole notion of student protest, little Berkeley shaped an entire decade (the Sixties). But it seems to have been a long time, like half a century, since anything important started here. The Bay Area, however, remains enormously innovative (Google, Twitter, Intel, and so on).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Marginal Revolution commenter <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/04/jurgen-osterhammel-on-the-crimean-war.html" target="_blank">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>South Korea being prosperous has had no benefit to me, yet I have borne the cost.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say: Wait ten years. No country combines innovation and quality like South Korea. Samsung illustrates quality but the innovation is less clear. Here are examples.<span id="more-13453"></span></p>
<p>1. <strong>Food preparation</strong>. In Seoul, a friend took me to an American-style buffet. <em>Nothing could be worse</em>, I thought. But I was blown away by original treatments of familiar things. One was an octopus salad. It was truly chewy and crunchy, in contrast to most restaurant salads. Whoever designed it understood underlying principles &#8212; they weren&#8217;t just mindlessly copying. The fruit on offer included burnt sugar grapefruit &#8212; small pieces of grapefruit with a little bit of added sugar, then torched. The burnt sugar adds complexity. A simple small cheap attractive practical dish &#8212; not grilled grapefruit with too much brown sugar.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Cafes</strong>. Seoul is bursting with little cafes that are pleasant places to spend a few hours. They are well-decorated (many individually-decorated), serve interesting food and drink, and make Starbucks look cold, hard and stodgy. You can easily spend $6 on dinner and $6 on a drink afterwards but the $6 drink seems worth it. One Korean explained the profusion of beautiful useful cafes on competition (&#8220;Koreans are very competitive&#8221;). Another Korean said it was the TV series <em>Sex in the City</em> (&#8220;The characters spent a lot of time in cafes&#8221;). There are two Korean cafes near where I live in Beijing.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Bakery</strong>. <a href="http://discoveringkorea.com/100218/seouls-best-bakeries/" target="_blank">Korean bakeries</a> have what Americans expect in a bakery, such as bread and croissants, but also have many more products, both baked goods and other food, than American bakeries. There are many Korean bakeries in Beijing.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Airport</strong>. Incheon Airport was voted the best airport in the world for 7 years; in the most recent two years, it was voted second best. I&#8217;m not sure this reflects innovation that future airport architects will want to study; new airports have a huge advantage for which I cannot adjust. But Incheon has free wifi that works; Beijing International Airport has free wifi that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Door lock</strong>. Nice houses and apartments in Seoul have a kind of digital door lock I haven&#8217;t seen anywhere else. Via Google I found <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Security-Keyless-Entry-Electronic-Digital-Door-lock-Milre-MI-3710-Aurora-/271027354688" target="_blank">this</a> &#8212; which, lo and behold, comes from South Korea. These locks are better in several ways than other electronic door locks. For example, the keys are lit. My guess is that new houses and apartments in America don&#8217;t have these locks because Americans don&#8217;t even know they exist. Apparently a South Korean company (Milre) figured out that substantial improvement was possible. There isn&#8217;t even an English Wikipedia entry for Milre, yet it will have more effect on your life than, oh, 99.999% of the current entries.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Pop music</strong>. Gangnam style, obviously; K-Pop, slightly less obviously, if you don&#8217;t live in Asia. Gangnam style = K-Pop plus humor.</p>
<p>Keep in mind South Korea is small (population 50 million; the population of Japan is 130 million). A country that is a lot more prosperous now than 30 years ago is a good place to innovate because all the crummy old stuff is being replaced &#8212; that is clear. It is also a big plus for innovation if its citizens are well-educated. If you understand that, and how bad the United States is at innovation (housing, health care, cars, education . . . ), you will see that helping South Korea become prosperous was a great investment. Inadvertently great, but great nonetheless.</p>
<p>In <i>Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel&#8217;s Economic Miracle</i>, the authors (Dan Senor and Saul Singer) argued that Israel is unusually innovative because no one defers to their superiors, everyone challenges everyone else (&#8220;The Israeli said, &#8220;What does &#8220;excuse me&#8221; mean?&#8221;). In The Ethnic Theory of Air Crashes, a chapter in <i>Outliers</i>, Malcolm Gladwell repeated the theory that Korean Air had a lot of crashes because co-pilots were too deferential. Which is only to say we have a lot to learn about innovation and South Korea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://zeynepton.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Good Jobs Strategy</em></a> by Zeynep Ton, published in January, argues that retailers should change low-level jobs in four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer fewer choices &#8212; fewer versions of each product.</li>
<li>Standardize common tasks and empower employees to handle unusual situations.</li>
<li>Cross-train employees so that each employee can do several jobs.</li>
<li>Operate with slack, that is, hire more employees than seemingly necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The brilliance of this book is that it addresses a major problem (bad jobs), includes substantial evidence and persuasive argument, is practical, and is exceedingly non-obvious (judging by how many retailers already follow her recommendations). Ton is an MIT business school professor whose area of expertise is operations.</p>
<p>I interviewed her by email.<span id="more-13027"></span></p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> How did you get into studying this? My impression is that the details of how employees are treated is not what operations professors usually study.</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> Early in my career I studied pervasive operational problems at retail stores that hurt supply chain and financial performance. My doctoral thesis was on misplaced products and the resulting phantom stockouts. I found that even retailers that were great at managing the backend of their supply chain, by getting the right products to the right stores at the right time, were pretty bad at managing the last ten yards of their supply chain. Once the products made it to the store, they would stay in the backroom or in the wrong place and often not meet the customer that wanted to buy them.</p>
<p>Problems like misplaced products were common, frequent, and had a huge impact on customer service, sales, and profits. When I studied what drove these problems I found that stores that had more workload for employees, lower training, and more employee turnover had worse performance.</p>
<p>Things really clicked for me several years ago when I was presenting my research to a group of retail managers and executives. I showed them my findings from analyzing a lot of data from Borders that showed that if stores increased the amount of people they would make more money. This finding just didn’t make sense—why would managers staff their stores with too few people even though having more would increase profits? When I asked people in the audience to raise their hands if I would find a similar result if I analyzed data from their chain, almost all raised their hands.</p>
<p>What I saw was that a lot of retailers were operating in what I call a vicious cycle. Low investment in employees caused operational problems, which reduced customer service, sales, and profits. When stores had low sales and profits, they had low labor budgets, which further reduced their investment in employees.</p>
<p>Everybody suffers from this vicious cycle. Employees have bad jobs, customer get bad service, and investors are worse off because there is a lot of money left at the table. I thought there have to be some companies that operate much better. That’s how I started looking at firms that follow the good jobs strategy.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> How have your ideas on this subject changed over the years?</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> There was a period when I wasn’t sure if excellence was possible in low-cost retail. All the examples around me were of retailers that offered bad jobs and had poor operational performance. When I went to Spain to study Mercadona I realized that I finally had found the “Toyota Production System” of retailing. What really excited me was studying QuikTrip after Mercadona. Here were two completely different companies—the largest supermarket chain in Spain and a convenience store chain with gas stations based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Yet they were both beating their competitors by offering much better jobs than their competitors. At the same time they were both offering low prices and great service to their customers.</p>
<p>When I looked into what allowed them to deliver value to their employees, customers, and investors at the same time, I saw that they were both excellent operators. They were both making a set of operational choices that reduced costs, increased employee productivity, and allowed employees to have a big role in driving profits. When I looked at Costco and Trader Joe’s, I saw they were making the same choices. In my book I highlight the four choices I observed [shared by these four companies].</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> When you present these ideas to retailers, what is their reaction? Of course there is a range of reactions, but which reactions surprised you the most? Which reactions did you learn the most from?</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> The reaction that I learned most from is the following. When Marshall Fisher, a Wharton professor and a thought leader in operations management, presented his finding that retailers could make more money by increasing staffing levels, a CEO said, &#8220;I spend my days saying no to a long line of people suggesting ways to spend money, including adding more staff. I don&#8217;t need a couple of Ivy League professors with their fancy statistical analysis giving them more ammunition!&#8221;</p>
<p>This really shows how retailers view their labor — as a cost to be minimized.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px;">ROBERTS </strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">What do you think about how Amazon treats employees? Do you have any suggestions for them? [The book is published by Amazon.]</span></p>
<p><strong>TON </strong>I have not studied Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> Your book lacked a chapter called &#8220;What Happens When&#8230;&#8221; about what happens when companies try to implement the changes you suggest &#8212; I mean, make changes based on your research. Can you say anything about that?</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> Of the four model retailers that follow the good jobs strategy, only one went through a dramatic change. Mercadona started as a company that operated just like most companies operate right now, but had to change in order to compete against much larger companies. I hope that my book will encourage more companies to adopt a good jobs strategy. If I can observe some of these changes, I will be in a better position to offer suggestions for implementation.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>ROBERTS</strong> It seems to me the underlying theme of your book is &#8220;Look, your employees have brains. The more you take advantage of those brains, the better off everyone &#8212; you, them, owners, customers &#8212; will be.&#8221; Is that a fair summary?</span></p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> One could say that the book is about designing the work that employees do to leverage committed, motivated, and capable employees. It’s also about making smart operational choices that benefit employees, customers, and investors at the same time.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px;">ROBERTS </strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Do you have a theory &#8212; is there a theory &#8212; that ties your four suggestions (&#8220;operational choices&#8221;) together? Is there an underlying principle from which all four of them can be deduced?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>TON </strong>The four choices I observed are choices that operationally excellent companies have been making for decades and they could be traced to lean manufacturing. Overall, the good jobs strategy—the combination of the four choices and investment in people—is a blueprint for operational excellence.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px;">ROBERTS</strong><span style="font-size: 13px;"> Why has it been hard to learn to make the choices you describe?</span></p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> Unfortunately, the dominant view in business is that paying employees as little as possible and treating them as a cost to be minimized is the best and perhaps only way to run a profitable business, especially in industries with low profit margins.</p>
<p>As I show in my book, that’s not the only way and that’s not even the best way.</p>
<p>But companies can make bad choices just like people can make bad choices. We know exercising is great for our health but regular exercise requires commitment, discipline, hard work and a long-term view. The good jobs strategy is good for companies’ health but that too requires commitment, discipline, hard work, and long-term view.</p>
<p>Excellence is always harder to achieve than mediocrity. And right now we have too many companies stuck in mediocrity.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>You say &#8220;the dominant view in business is that paying employees as little as possible and treating them as a cost to be minimized is the best and perhaps only way to run a profitable business, especially in industries with low profit margins.&#8221; That is a common-sense view that Adam Smith might have expounded. Why has such a wrong view persisted so long? On the face of it, I would think that how to treat employees would be one of the central questions that business professors (and CEOs) try to answer and nobody would be satisfied with repeating ideas of several hundred years ago. It&#8217;s one thing for a third grade teacher to tell students &#8220;the earth is flat&#8221; &#8212; yes, it looks vaguely flat. But for sophisticated university professors and captains of industry to say &#8220;the earth is flat&#8221; for hundreds of years when there is a vast amount of money to be made from realizing it isn&#8217;t flat, that is puzzling.</p>
<p><strong>TON  </strong>But it&#8217;s not just ignorance. Perhaps I should have worded it differently.  Following the good jobs strategy is not easy. You have to get many things right.  It requires excellence.</p>
<p><strong>POSTSCRIPT </strong>This is what Ton said in the book &#8212; that the good jobs strategy is difficult. I wasn&#8217;t persuaded. CEOs of major retailers have done many things that are not easy. Why has this difficult thing been out of reach?</p>
<p>I suspect an examination of why the 4 retailers Ton study broke from the pack and treated their employees differently would not find that the people in charge were more capable of excellence than the leaders of other companies. Maybe their personalities were different, maybe their cultures (internal company culture or external society culture) were different, I have no idea.</p>
<p>I am unsurprised that business profs had failed to figure out what Ton figured out (although her conclusions are supported by the work of other professors). Other disciplines have enormous blind spots &#8212; epidemiologists never study the immune system, for example. The more things you can take for granted, such as the idea that labor is a cost to be minimized, the easier it is to publish papers. In academia what is rewarded and selected for is not solving real problems, it is publishing papers in prestigious journals, which is quite different.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Martin Feldman, a Harvard professor of economics and former advisor to President Reagan, is <a href="http://www.higherwages.org/opinion/a-hype-free-way-to-help-low-wage-workers/" target="_blank">against a hike in the minimum wage</a>. One of his arguments:</p>
<blockquote><p>When low-skill labor becomes more expensive, employers have a greater incentive to mechanize or outsource their work.</p></blockquote>
<p>He &#8212; like most economists &#8212; ignores the point that an increase in the minimum wage, by forcing employers to reexamine familiar practices, will increase innovation. (I have seen non-economists make this point.)<span id="more-12753"></span></p>
<p>How you can hope to understand economics without understanding innovation is beyond me. I realize that economics is a job &#8212; that academic economists try to write papers that make incremental improvements in understanding and innovation is not always important. Yet the whole profession seems stuck in a world where it is okay to ignore innovation and okay to try to increase productivity yet not acknowledge that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/06/government-as-useful-irritant-and-rules-of-innovation-what-libertarians-and-other-economists-miss/" target="_blank">productivity and innovation are often at odds</a>. (For example, almost all foreign aid programs ignore innovation.) I have never heard or read an economist make this simple and obvious point. The situation reminds me of a friend of mine. When she was in first grade, she had a lot of pennies. Now and then she would spend some. She knew how to add but not subtract, so after she spent some she had to count them all again. At least she got the right answer eventually. Economists, not understanding the effect of Policy X on innovation, really cannot predict the effects of any policy that affects innovation.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t just economists. Epidemiologists seem stuck in a world where it is okay to ignore the immune system. They act as if the immune system does not exist, except perhaps when someone asks them why smoking is so bad and they reply &#8220;maybe it reduces immune function&#8221;. Statistics professors seem stuck in a world where it is okay to ignore the question of how to generate an idea worth testing, except to grant that making graphs is helpful.</p>
<p>Psychology professors, at least the ones who do experiments, are also stuck that world. With few exceptions, they have no idea how to generate ideas plausible enough to be worth testing. You can read a thousand psychology textbooks and ten thousand psychology papers and end up knowing no more about how to do that than when you started. It is a methodological question, yes, but maybe you have to be a psychology professor to grasp how disabling it is to not have a good way to generate ideas (ideas plausible enough to be worth the cost of testing). It is like having a car &#8212; psychology professors know a lot about how to do experiments to test ideas &#8212; but no fuel.</p>
<p>Something is making a lot of very smart very capable people ignore the obvious. I have a theory of why these vast areas of ignorance &#8212; easily noticed, yet rarely acknowledged &#8212; exist. It is because science is slow and difficult and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">in several ways incompatible with careerism</a>. Science is innovation, careerism is productivity. You, a professional scientist, are trying to climb up a wall of rock (= discover stuff) but you have to lift your career at the same time. Really really hard. If you can pretend to climb, that&#8217;s much easier. (My solution was to ignore my career, which <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=12883" target="_blank">suffered great damage</a>.) Distant observers, including granting agencies, university administrators, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/01/when-will-genomics-cure-cancer/355739/" target="_blank">journalists</a> and the general public, have a hard time telling the difference between real climbing and pretend climbing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/06/government-as-useful-irritant-and-rules-of-innovation-what-libertarians-and-other-economists-miss/" target="_blank">a recent post</a> called &#8220;Government as useful irritant&#8221; I said five factors increase innovation: 1. Freedom. 2. Benefit. 3. Resources. 4. Pain. 5. Stability. The effect of government isn&#8217;t simple. It might freedom &#8212; to the extent the coercion outweighs the protection &#8212; and of course corrupt governments make it harder to benefit from your innovation. On the other hand, governments often provide resources, pain and stability. Several of the factors are contradictory &#8212; pain and stability, for example &#8212; which makes it hard to produce optimal conditions, at least without paying attention to what actually happens.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/snowden-and-greenwald-the-men-who-leaked-the-secrets-20131204?print=true" target="_blank">A article I read</a> soon after that (&#8220;Snowden and Greenwald: The Men Who Leaked the Secrets&#8221;) had two relevant examples. One of my points was that increasing inequality reduces innovation bad because it means the people at the top get more and more comfortable, which reduces their desire to innovate. The more inequality, the more of the population falls into two categories: 1. Too poor to innovate (not enough resources). 2. Too comfortable to innovate (not enough pain).</p>
<p>Greenwald saw the value of pain:</p>
<blockquote><p>After graduation, he accepted a job in the litigation department of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz . . . &#8220;I could not thrive or even function in a controlling institution like that. There&#8217;s a huge dichotomy between people who grow up with alienation, which, for me, was invaluable, and people who grow up so completely privileged that it breeds this complacency and lack of desire to question or challenge or do anything significant.</p></blockquote>
<p>Snowden had all five factors in large amounts. He had freedom because his bosses paid him little attention and, because of his IT talent, it was easy to get a job. He also had a lot of money. Obviously he had great resources, including IT talent, knowledge and access. He had pain because he was disgusted by NSA overreach and Obama&#8217;s failure to improve things. He had stability because he had a steady job. The money helped here, too. Because the revelations are so large, he benefits a lot, even if there is also a very big cost.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hayek, Keynes, Milton Friedman and Paul Samuelson disagreed about many things but shared one important belief: <em>Their ignorance about innovation didn&#8217;t matter</em>. Countless economics textbooks, which say nothing of interest about innovation, agree with them: <em>ignorance about innovation doesn&#8217;t matter</em>. This belief freed Hayek et al. and textbook writers to make sweeping policy statements. Had they realized that innovation matters, not just productivity &#8212; and, especially, that innovation and productivity are sometimes at odds &#8212; it would have been far less clear what policies are best. <span id="more-12420"></span></p>
<p>If you ask <em>how will this affect innovation?</em> about any economic proposal everything changes, especially your certainty that it is right or wrong. I will give just one example. Libertarians &#8212; I hope I am describing Tyler Cowen&#8217;s &#8220;smart&#8221; libertarians &#8212; believe that government interference by and large makes things worse. People function best when given freedom, and so on. A smart libertarian recognizes the value of speed limits, and so on. An example of smart libertarianism, I assume, is <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/11/assorted-links-983.html" target="_blank">Tyler&#8217;s recent view</a> that a local increase of the minimum wage is &#8220;expressive voting at the expense of good economic policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Libertarians and other economists neglect the possibility that government serves as a useful irritant. Government regulations are truly an impediment. No doubt about it. No doubt they make life harder for people with some power. The usual argument is <em>they protect the weak from the powerful. Without them, the powerful would exploit the weak. </em>Sure. They would. But that&#8217;s not all. What goes unsaid and apparently unnoticed is <em>irritating the powerful makes them think</em>. Pain produces thought &#8212; about how to avoid the pain. And thought increases innovation.</p>
<p>As a professor at Berkeley, I hated the government-mandated institutional review boards &#8212; the human subjects approval committee and the animal research approval committee. They didn&#8217;t just make research far more difficult due to paperwork requirements, they did horrible things to people based on misunderstandings and mistakes. And there was no appeal. How awful, right? Well, it was certainly painful. That pain is one thing that pushed me toward personal science, where I could be free of them. Pain pushed me to try new things &#8212; such as long-term non-trivial self-experimentation. The less I could do professional research (my Ph.D. is in animal learning), the more time I had for personal science. And I brought to my personal science the skill set of a professional scientist (an understanding of experimental design and data analysis, subject-matter knowledge, and so on). Innovation always comes from exploration. The more exploration, the more innovation. Pushing powerful people (such as a Berkeley professor) to explore is a seriously good thing.</p>
<p>Planet Money recently did a series on T-shirts. Planet Money reporters travelled the world &#8212; the Planet Money men&#8217;s T-shirt is made in Bangladesh &#8212; and encountered several things not in economics textbooks. One was <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/11/30/247360903/nixon-and-kimchee-how-the-garment-industry-came-to-bangladesh" target="_blank">the story of how clothing factories came to Bangladesh</a>. That you could put a clothing factory in such places and make a profit was a discovery with great consequences, especially for Bangladesh. In the 1970s, American clothing companies felt endangered by imported clothes &#8212; from South Korea, for example. They pressed government for trade protection. This led to the passage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Fibre_Arrangement" target="_blank">Multi Fibre Arrangement</a> (MFA) which regulated clothing imports. The agreement, however, said nothing about Bangladesh, which at the time did not make clothes. When South Korea reached its limit under the MFA, a Bangladeshi businessman approached Daewoo, a giant South Korean clothing maker, suggesting that they duplicate their factory in Bangladesh. The head of Daewoo &#8212; a powerful man pained by government regulations &#8212; was open to their suggestion. Daewoo helped open the first clothing factory in Bangladesh. There are now more than 4000.</p>
<p>When it comes to productivity, there is one set of rules, which economists have worked on since Adam Smith. Innovation has a different set of rules. Most economists seem barely aware that the two sets of rules often clash &#8212; what is good for productivity is bad for innovation. Let me sketch a few of the innovation rules. Innovation needs freedom, of course, and the ability to profit from your invention, which I&#8217;ll call <em>benefit. </em>It is also called self-interest. The importance of benefit/self-interest for innovation is the main point of <a href="http://whynationsfail.com/" target="_blank"><em>Why Nations Fail</em></a> by Acemoglu and Robinson. Innovation is also increased by resources, such as skills, knowledge, space, and equipment. After discussing this with Bryan Caplan, I believe many economists are well aware these three factors (freedom, benefit, resources) affect innovation. All three also increase productivity &#8212; for example, more resources, more productivity. Far fewer economists realize that two other things, which act <strong>against</strong> productivity, are also very helpful for innovation:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Pain</strong>. Not a lot &#8212; not debilitating or all-consuming pain &#8212; but enough to make you think hard. <em>Necessity is the mother of invention</em> is the aphorism, which isn&#8217;t quite right. Pain, not necessity. Government is useful here, as I said. So is war. Many innovations came from wars. A famous example is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=p3IweU12jH0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s" target="_blank">the greenback</a>, which came from the Civil War.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Stability</strong>. To innovate, you need free time, which is different from freedom (ask any prisoner). Free time allows painless failure, very helpful for innovation. To have free time, you need a secure job. Government is useful here, too. So is tenure. Pain plus stability = peacetime military spending. The internet came from peacetime military spending. Professors were the first users. Stability also promotes innovation because it makes it easier to detect small improvements. The quieter it is, the better you can detect soft sounds.</p>
<p><a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">My personal science</a> had a good amount of all five factors. 1. <strong>Freedom</strong>. Studying myself, I could do whatever I wanted. 2. <strong>Benefit</strong>. At first, I benefited because my discoveries were very practical. If I discovered how to sleep better, I would sleep better. If I discovered how to lose weight, I would lose weight. Later I also benefited because others were interested (I like attention) and my discoveries helped others. 3. <strong>Resources</strong>. I knew a great deal about the relevant subjects (e.g., circadian rhythms, weight regulation) and how to do research. I could get whatever articles I wanted from the UC Berkeley libraries. And so on. 4. <strong>Pain</strong>. In addition to the pain caused by Berkeley IRBs, I wanted to sleep better and lose weight. My sleep was not awful nor was I especially fat &#8212; it was not intense pain. But it pushed me. I tried to improve my sleep for ten years before I started making progress. 5. <strong>Stability</strong>. My life was very stable. I rarely took long trips, for example. Failure in my personal science &#8212; a treatment that I hoped would improve my sleep didn&#8217;t work, for example &#8212; cost very little. Failure to publish cost nothing.</p>
<p>In contrast, professional scientists, who have plenty of resources, are generally low or at least lower on the other four factors (freedom, benefit, pain, stability). They lack freedom. They are constrained in many ways, which they don&#8217;t like to talk about. They lack benefit. A few papers that hardly anyone reads &#8212; the result of most research &#8212; provides little benefit. Almost all research has no practical use. Few scientists study problems that they themselves suffer from. A cancer researcher does not himself have cancer, for example. They lack pain. I cannot think of a single instance where professional research was motivated by the researcher&#8217;s pain or discomfort. If they don&#8217;t need a grant for their research and have tenure, they have stability; but if they do need a grant or don&#8217;t have tenure, they have less stability than I did. Most research grants are only three years long and renewal is rarely easy or assured.</p>
<p>I wrote about the same question &#8212; why was my personal science &#8220;unreasonably effective&#8221;? &#8212; <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>What does this say about economics and how to increase innovation? The importance of benefit and resources is already clear. But the remaining three factors &#8212; freedom, pain, and stability &#8212; are complicated. By and large they are corners of a triangle. The more freedom, the less pain and stability. The more pain, the less freedom and stability. The more stability, the less pain and freedom. You need all three &#8212; a point in the middle of the triangle &#8212; and where that point should be and how to put it there are exceedingly non-obvious. Once you realize this, your certainty about how to organize society, how run a government, and the best size of government should decrease. A problem with increasing inequality, which I have never seen pointed out (e.g., in a speech about why inequality is bad, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/running-transcript-president-obamas-december-4-remarks-on-the-economy/2013/12/04/7cec31ba-5cff-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story_4.html" target="_blank">Obama didn&#8217;t mention it</a>), is that it makes the powerful (those at the top) more comfortable. When you make the powerful more comfortable, you reduce innovation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html" target="_blank">a graduation speech</a>, Richard Feynman called certain intellectual endeavors &#8220;cargo cult science,&#8221; meaning they had the trappings of science but not the substance. One thing he criticized was rat psychology. He was wrong about that. Sure, as Feynman complained, lots of rat psychology experiments have led nowhere, just as lots of books aren&#8217;t good. But you need to publish lots of bad books to support the infrastructure necessary to publish a few good ones. The same is true of rat psychology experiments. A few are very good. The bad make possible the good. Rat psychology experiments, especially those by Israel Ramirez and Anthony Sclafani, led me to a new theory of weight control, which led me to the Shangri-La Diet.</p>
<p>Cargo cult science does exist.  The most important modern example is evidence-based medicine. Notice how ritualistic it is and how little progress medicine has made since it became popular. An evidence-based medicine review of tonsillectomies <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html" target="_blank">failed to realize they were worse than voodoo</a>. Voodoo, unlike a tonsillectomy, does not damage your immune system. The evidence-based medicine reviewers appeared not to know that tonsils are part of the immune system. Year after year, the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology tells the world, between the lines of the press release, that once again medical researchers have failed to make progress on any major disease, as the prize is always given for work with little or no practical value. In the 1950s, the polio vaccine was progress; so was figuring out that smoking causes lung cancer (which didn&#8217;t get a Nobel Prize). There have been no comparable advances since then. Researchers at top medical schools remain profoundly unaware of what causes heart disease, most cancers, depression, bipolar disorder, obesity, diabetes and so on.</p>
<p>I came across cargo-cult thinking recently in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming" target="_blank">a talk by Neil Gaiman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was in China in 2007, at the first party-approved science fiction and fantasy convention in Chinese history. And at one point I took a top official aside and asked him Why? SF had been disapproved of for a long time. What had changed?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple, he told me. The Chinese were brilliant at making things if other people brought them the plans. But they did not innovate and they did not invent. They did not imagine. So they sent a delegation to the US, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Google, and they asked the people there who were inventing the future about themselves. And they found that all of them had read science fiction when they were boys or girls.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know about Chinese engineers at Microsoft and Google in Beijing. They want to leave the country. An American friend, who worked at Microsoft, was surprised by the unanimity of their desire to leave. I wasn&#8217;t surprised. Why innovate or invent if the government might seize your company? Which is the main point of <em>Why Nations Fail</em>. Allowing science fiction in China doesn&#8217;t change that.</p>
<p>Thanks to Claire Hsu.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big public works projects inevitably cost far more than the original budget. I heard a talk about this a few years ago. The speaker gave many examples, including Boston&#8217;s Big Dig. His explanation was that these projects would not be approved if voters were told the truth. The German <del>newspaper</del> magazine <em>Der </em><em>Spiegel</em> has just published <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/de-meuron-von-gerkan-and-ingenhoven-on-german-construction-headaches-a-905472.html" target="_blank">an interview with several architects</a> responsible for recent German projects with especially large discrepancies between what people were told at the beginning and the unfolding reality &#8212; Berlin&#8217;s new airport, for example. The article&#8217;s headline calls them &#8220;debacles&#8221;. One architect gives the same explanation as the speaker I heard: &#8220;The pure truth doesn&#8217;t get you far in this business. The opera house in Sydney would never have been approved if they had known how much it would cost from the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree. I see the same massive underestimation of time and effort in projects that I do and that my colleagues and friends do, projects we do for ourselves that require no one&#8217;s approval. I think something will take an hour. It takes five hours. Plainly the world is more complicated than our mental model of it, sure, but there is more to it than that. Someone did a survey of people in Maryland who had been in a car accident so bad they had had to go to the hospital. Within only a year, a large fraction of them (half?) had forgotten about it. When asked if within the last year they had had an accident so bad they were hospitalized, they said no. Apparently we forget difficulties, even extreme ones, really fast. If you forget difficulties, you will underestimate them.</p>
<p><em>If I had realized how difficult everything would be, I couldn&#8217;t have done any of it</em> is one explanation, which I&#8217;ve heard attributed to Gregory Bateson. From <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2013/06/24/130624crbo_books_gladwell" target="_blank">Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s excellent review</a> in this week&#8217;s <em>New Yorker</em> of a biography of Albert Hirschman, the economist, I learned that Hirschman &#8212; had he realized that this was human nature &#8212; would have had a different evolutionary explanation: We underestimate difficulties because this way of thinking increases innovation. <span style="font-size: 13px;">Debacle . . . or opportunity? </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">Difficulty is the mother of invention. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is online teaching (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOC</a>) a big deal? In <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2012/11/12/alex-tabarrok/why-online-education-works/" target="_blank">an essay</a> (&#8220;Why Online Education Works&#8221;), Alex Tabarrok argues for the value of online education (meaning online lectures) compared to traditional lectures. A friend told me yesterday that MOOC was &#8220;a frontier of pedagogy&#8221;. No doubt online lectures will make lecture classes cheaper and more available. Lots of things have gone from scarce/expensive to common/cheap. With things whose effects we understand (e.g., combs), the result is straightforward: more people benefit. With things whose effects we don&#8217;t understand, the results are less predictable. Did the spread of sugar help us? Hard to say. Did the spread of antibiotics help us? Hard to say.  It may have helped sustain simplistic ideas about what causes disease (e.g., &#8220;acne is caused by bacteria&#8221;, &#8220;ulcers are caused by bacteria&#8221;) reducing effective innovation. Do we have a good idea of the effects of lectures (or their lack of effect), or a good theory of college education? I don&#8217;t think so. Could their spread help sustain simplistic ideas about education? Maybe.<span id="more-8169"></span></p>
<p>As books spread, the teaching of reading increased. Everyone understood that books were useless if people couldn&#8217;t read. The introduction of PCs was accompanied by user interface improvements. This helped PCs become influential&#8211; not restricted to hobbyists. Will online education be accompanied by similar make-it-more-palatable changes? I have heard nothing about this. Their advocates seem to think the current system is fine and if it could only be available to more people&#8230;</p>
<p>Online lectures will make much difference only if the cost and quality of lectures is the weakest link in what strikes me as a process with many links. It would be a coincidence if the link that can be most easily strengthened turned out to be the weakest link. For example, is the cost of lectures the main thing driving up the cost of college? That would be wonderful if it were true, but I haven&#8217;t seen evidence that it&#8217;s true. At Berkeley, for example, there has been enormous growth in the administrator-to-faculty ratio.</p>
<p>Here are two arguments used to argue that online lectures are a big step forward:</p>
<p><em> It will help people in poor countries, like Zambia</em>. There is a long history of people in rich countries misunderstanding people in poor countries. Several years ago I was in Guatemala. I heard about a school being built by a (rich country) religious group in a poor area. After two years, the American running it wanted to leave. No member of the community took it over. It disappeared. &#8220;Maybe they didn&#8217;t want a school,&#8221; said the graduate student who told me about it. Maybe few people in Zambia want online lecture classes. (I have no idea.) If so, the benefit will be small.</p>
<p><em>It will save labor</em>. Each lecture will be viewed many more times. Saving labor is not always good. It is plausible that the growth of online lectures will mean fewer college professors. Colleges and universities are among the few places where people do research and almost the only places where they do unrestricted research. Most of the research is useless; a tiny fraction is enormously useful. At the moment, lectures subsidize research. By giving lectures, professors are allowed to do research. Fewer professors, less unrestricted research, less innovation. &#8220;Wasteful&#8221; lecturing might be labor we shouldn&#8217;t save.</p>
<p>One thing I like about online classes is the possibility they will connect people who want to learn the same thing, like ordinary classes do. They can help each other, encourage each other, and so on. I have no doubts about the value of this. (I find language partners &#8212; I teach them English, they teach me Chinese &#8212; way more pleasant and helpful than tutors.)</p>
<p>At Berkeley, I tried to find good lecturers. With two exceptions (Tim White and Steve Glickman) I failed. Almost all lectures, even those by brilliant researchers, were dreary. (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/03/21/robin-hanson-on-doctors/" target="_blank">A shining exception by Robin Hanson</a>.) They suffered from a lack of stories and a lack of emotion. (At Tsinghua, things are worse. A friend who majors in bioengineering told me that 80% of her teachers lecture by reading from the textbook.)  The power of professors over students in some ways resembles the power of doctors over patients. Just as there is little pressure on doctors to understand disease (if antibiotics have bad effects, it doesn&#8217;t harm the doctor who prescribed them), there is little pressure on most professors &#8212; at least at the elite research universities that produce online lectures &#8212; to understand education. At Berkeley, many professors say they teach their undergraduate students &#8220;how to think&#8221; or &#8220;how to think critically&#8221;. In fact, they were teaching their students to imitate them. The simplest form of education. This is neither good nor bad &#8212; it depends on the student &#8212; but it is the opposite of sophisticated.</p>
<p>A few months ago I assigned my Tsinghua students (freshmen) to read 60 pages of <a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/JMichael-Bailey/TMWWBQ.pdf" target="_blank"><em>The Man Who Would Be Queen</em></a> by Michael Bailey, a book full of stories and emotion. Any 60 pages, their choice. No test, no written assignment, no grade. One student told me it was the first book in English she&#8217;d ever finished. It was so good she couldn&#8217;t stop reading. My assignment had changed real-life behavior: what my student read in her spare time. Maybe it changed her tolerance of homosexuality and the tolerance of those around her. My assignment (not a textbook or academic paper, not a fixed reading) and evaluation (none) differed from conventional college teaching. Experiences like this make me wonder what fraction of important learning during college happens due to lecture classes. (In my case, the fraction was zero.) If the fraction is low, it suggests that online learning won&#8217;t make much difference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/bad-pharma-by-ben-goldacre.html" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen</a> links to <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w18552#fromrss" target="_blank">a paper by Frank Lichtenberg</a>, an economist at Columbia University, that tries to estimate the benefits of drug company innovation by estimating how much new drugs prolong life compared to older drugs. The paper compares people equated in a variety of ways except the &#8220;vintage&#8221; (date of approval) of the drugs they take. <em>Does taking newer drugs increase life-span?</em> is the question Lichtenberg wants to answer. He concludes they do. He says his findings &#8220;suggest that two-thirds of the 0.6-year increase in the life expectancy of elderly Americans during 1996-2003 was due to the increase in drug vintage&#8221; &#8212; that is, to newer drugs.</p>
<p>An obvious problem is that Lichtenberg has not controlled for health-consciousness. This is <a href="http://geography.ssc.uwo.ca/faculty/baxter/readings/Taubes_limits_epidemiology_Science_1995.pdf" target="_blank">a standard epidemiological point</a>. People who adopt Conventional Healthy Behavior X (e.g., eat less fat) are more likely to adopt Conventional Healthy Behavior Y (e.g., find a better doctor) than those who don&#8217;t. For example, a study found that people who drink a proper amount of wine eat more vegetables. Another reason for a correlation between conventionally-healthy practices is mild depression. People who are mildly depressed are less likely to do twenty different helpful things (including &#8220;eat healthy&#8221; and &#8220;find a better doctor&#8221;) than people who are not mildly depressed. (And mild depression seems to be common.) Perhaps doctors differ. (Lichtenberg concludes there are big differences.) Perhaps better doctors (a) prescribe more recent drugs and (b) do other things that benefit their patients. Lichtenberg does not discuss these possibilities.</p>
<p>A subtle problem with Lichtenberg&#8217;s conclusion that we benefit from drug company innovation is that drug-company-like thinking &#8212; the notion that health problems should be &#8220;solved&#8221; with drugs &#8212; interferes with a better way of thinking: the notion that to solve a health problem, we should find out what aspects of the environment cause it. I suppose this is why we have Schools of Public Health &#8212; because this way of thinking, advocated at schools of public health, is so incompatible with what is said and done at medical schools. Public health thinking has a clear and impressive track record &#8212; for example, the disappearance of infectious disease as a major source of death. There are plenty of other examples: the drop in lung cancer after it was discovered that smoking causes lung cancer, the drop in birth defects after it was discovered that folate deficiency causes birth defects. Thinking centered on drugs has done nothing so helpful. Spending enormous amounts of money to develop new drugs shifts resources away from more cost-effective research: about environmental causes and prevention. Someone should ask the directors of the Susan K. Komen Foundation: Why &#8220;race for the cure&#8221;? Wouldn&#8217;t spending the money on prevention research save more lives?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ecologists understand the exploit/explore distinction. When an animal looks for food, it can either exploit (use previous knowledge of where food is) or explore (try to learn more about where food is). With ants, the difference is visible. Trail of ants to a food source: exploit. Solitary wandering ant: explore. With other animals, the difference is more subtle. You might think that when a rat presses a bar for food, that is pure exploitation. However, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0k16r0pt">my colleagues and I found that when expectation of food was lower, there was more variation</a> &#8212; more exploration &#8212; in <em>how</em> the rat pressed the bar. In a wide range of domains (genetics, business), less expectation of reward leads to more exploration.  In business, this is a common observation. For example, yesterday I read <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2012/04/washington-post-watergate">an article about the <em>Washington Post</em></a> that said its leaders failed to explore enough because they had a false sense of security provide by their Kaplan branch. &#8220;Thanks to Kaplan, the Post Company felt less pressure to make hard strategic choices—and less pressure to venture in new directions,&#8221; wrote Sarah Ellison.</p>
<p>Striking the right balance between exploitation and exploration is crucial. If an animal exploits too much, it will starve when its supply of food runs out. If it explores too much, it will starve right away. Every instance of collapse in Jared Diamond&#8217;s <em>Collapse: How Socieities Choose to Fail or Succeed</em> was plausibly due to too much exploitation, too little exploration (which Diamond, even though he is a biologist, fails to say). I&#8217;ve posted several times about my discovery that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/walking-and-learning/">treadmill walking made studying Chinese more pleasant</a>. I believe walking creates a thirst for dry knowledge. My evolutionary explanation is that this pushed prehistoric humans to explore more.</p>
<p>I have never heard an economist make this point: the need for proper balance between exploit and explore. <span id="more-7683"></span>It is relevant in a large fraction of discussions about how to spend money. For example, yesterday I listened to <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/09/frank_and_rober.html">the latest EconTalk podcast</a>, a debate between Bob Frank and Russ Roberts about whether it would be a good idea for the American government to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure projects (fix bridges, etc.). Frank said it would create jobs, and so on &#8212; the usual argument. Roberts said if fixing bridges was such a good idea, why hadn&#8217;t this choice already been made? Roberts could have said, but didn&#8217;t, that massive government shovel-ready expenditures, such as $2 trillion spent on infrastructure repair, inevitably push the exploit/explore balance toward exploit, which is dangerous. This is an argument against all Keynesian stimulus-type spending. I have heard countless arguments about such spending. I have never heard it made. If you want examples of how the American economy suffers from a profound lack of useful new ideas, look at health care. As far as I know, there are no recorded instances of a society dying because of too much exploration. The problem is always too much exploitation. People at the top &#8212; with a tiny number of exceptions, such as the Basques &#8212; overestimate the stability of their position. At the end of <em>The Economy of Cities</em>, Jane Jacobs says that if a spaceship landed on Earth, she would want to know how their civilization avoided overexploitation. When societies exploit too much and explore too little, said Jacobs, problems (in our society, problems such as obesity, autism, autoimmune disease, etc.) stack up unsolved. Today is China&#8217;s birthday. Due to overexploitation, I believe China is in even worse economic shape than America. Ron Unz, whom I respect, <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/chinas-rise-americas-fall/">misses this</a>.</p>
<p>My broad point is that a lot of economic thinking, especially about growth and development, is one-dimensional (measuring primarily growth of previously existing goods and services &#8212; exploitation) when it should be two-dimensional (measuring both (a) growth of existing stuff and (b) creation of new goods and services). Exploration (successful exploration) is inevitably tiny compared to exploitation, but it is crucial there be enough of it. If there is a textbook that makes this point, I haven&#8217;t seen it. An example of getting it right is Hugh Sinclair&#8217;s excellent new book <a href="http://www.microfinancetransparency.com/"><em>Confessions of a Microfinance Heretic</em></a> (copy sent me by publisher) that debunks microcredit. Leaving aside the very high interest rates, the use of microcredit loans to buy TVs, and so on, microcredit is <em>still</em> a bad idea because the money is, at best, used for a business that copies an existing business. (The higher the interest rate, the less risk a loan recipient dares take.)  When a new business copies an already-existing business, you are taking an existing pie (e.g., demand for milk, if the loan has been used to buy a cow and sell its milk) and dividing it into one more piece. The pie does not get bigger. As Sinclair says, the notion that dividing existing pies into more pieces will &#8220;create a poverty-free world&#8221; is, uh, <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/yunus-lecture-en.html">not worthy of a Nobel Prize</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s hard to measure growth of useful knowledge. (It is perfectly possible for a company to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/09/11/modern-veblen-flight-from-data/">waste its entire R&amp;D budget</a>.) However, I am quite sure that realism does better than make-believe &#8212; and the notion that growth of GDP is a satisfactory metric of economic growth is make-believe. If you&#8217;ve ever been sick, or gone to college, and have a sense of history, you will have noticed the profound stagnation in two unavoidable sectors (health care and education) of our economy. That are growing really fast.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a Planet Money show about whether Super Bowls help host cities, a sports economist named <a href="http://college.holycross.edu/faculty/vmatheso/">Victor Matheson</a>, a professor at College of the Holy Cross, described himself and other sports economists:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re economists. And we&#8217;re concerned about equity and we&#8217;re concerned about efficiency. And what most economists see . . . &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>He <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> say &#8220;We&#8217;re concerned about innovation&#8221;. The way he ignores innovation reflects the whole field of economics. Here&#8217;s the same thing from Christine Romer. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/business/do-manufacturers-need-special-treatment-economic-view.html?_r=2">an editorial about whether manufacturing deserves special treatment</a>, she considers only productivity and equity:</p>
<blockquote><p>It might be better to enact policies that will make all American businesses and workers more productive and successful. . . Today, we face a profound shortfall of demand. . . .We need actions that raise overall demand. [She doesn't say we are in a period of profound stagnation in most industries, which is also true.] . . . More aggressive monetary policy that lowered the price of the dollar would stimulate all our exports . . . Moving is very costly for dislocated workers with ties to their communities. . . Manufacturing jobs are seen as one of the few sources of well-paying jobs for less-educated workers. . . . Public policy . . . should be based on hard evidence of market failures, and reliable data on the proposals’ impact on jobs and income inequality.</p></blockquote>
<p>As if innovation (and lack of it) don&#8217;t exist. Here&#8217;s an example from Robert Reich, in <a href="http://robertreich.org/post/11329289033">a post &#8220;rebut[ing] the seven biggest economic lies&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Shrinking government generates more jobs</em>. Wrong again. It means fewer government workers – everyone from teachers, fire fighters, police officers, and social workers at the state and local levels to safety inspectors and military personnel at the federal. And fewer government contractors, who would employ fewer private-sector workers. According to Moody’s economist Mark Zandi (a campaign advisor to John McCain), the $61 billion in spending cuts proposed by the House GOP will cost the economy 700,000 jobs this year and next.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing about the effect of shrinking government on innovation. Many types of innovation increase jobs.</p>
<p>This is like <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html">doctors ignoring the immune system</a>. Ignoring the effect of this or that policy on innovation is likely to lead to decisions that reduce innovation in favor of something easier to measure or defend, such as productivity or equity. The cumulative effect of ignoring innovation is stagnation and decline, caused by problems that got worse and worse as, due to lack of innovation, they failed to be solved.</p>
<p>Tyler Cowen (<em>The Great Stagnation</em>) and Alex Tabarrok (<em>Launching the Innovation Renaissance</em>) are absolutely right to focus on innovation and the lack of it. The obesity epidemic is 30 years old &#8212; a good example of a problem that has gotten worse and worse. Judging by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/tara-parker-pope-fat-trap.html?pagewanted=all">Tara Parker-Pope&#8217;s reporting</a>, mainstream weight researchers don&#8217;t have a clue &#8212; in the form of empirical results &#8212; how to solve it. Outside mainstream academia, the dominant weight-loss idea is a low-carb diet. That idea is a hundred years old (Banting). How little innovation there has been. That Parker-Pope failed to criticize researchers for their lack of progress shows how deep the problem is. She appears not to grasp the possibility.</p>

<li>A brash high-school student discovers &#8212; maybe by accident &#8212; how much famous writers, such as Ralph Ellison, Norman Mailer, and John Updike, <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want to write. <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/12/05/document-the-symbolism-survey/">Any excuse to avoid writing will do.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/12/john_cochranes_1.html">A pretty good  talk by John Cochrane</a>, a University of Chicago professor of economics, called &#8220;Restoring Robust Economic Growth in America&#8221;. What&#8217;s most interesting is what&#8217;s missing. At one point he asks: &#8220;Why are we stagnating? I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think anyone knows, really. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here at this fascinating conference.&#8221; In spite of this topic, his talk contains nothing about what controls the rate of innovation. Not only does he not know anything about this (judging by this talk), he doesn&#8217;t even realize the gap in his knowledge (judging by this talk).  Shades of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/13/nobel-prize-report-card/">Thomas Sargent</a>. It&#8217;s as if a Harvard Medical School professor spoke about how to fight disease without mentioning the immune system, without even appearing to know that the immune system exists. (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/12/12/111212fa_fact_specter">Which happens</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garum">Garum,</a> a fermented fish sauce. It was the &#8220;supreme condiment&#8221; of ancient Rome.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/the_magic_of_ed.html">this post</a>, Bryan Caplan says (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/03/24/agrees-with-me-about-college/">again</a>) that college is vastly overrated. Like me, he says that the only thing college professors know how to do is be professors and that is all they can actually teach. Graduate school, where professors teach students who want to be professors, makes sense. Undergraduate school, where almost no students will become professors, does not. Like me, he ridicules the idea that professors teach students &#8220;how to think&#8221;. </p>
<p>He omits half of my criticism. It isn&#8217;t just teaching (&#8220;how to think&#8221; &#8212; please!), it&#8217;s also evaluation. Professors are terrible at evaluation. Their method of judging student work is very simple: <em>How close is it to what I would have done?</em> The better you can imitate the professor, no matter what the class, the higher your grade. This is <em>one size fits all</em> with a vengeance because there is no opting out. Sure, you can choose your major. But every class is taught by a professor. What if your strengths lie elsewhere &#8212; in something that your professors aren&#8217;t good at? Tough luck. Your strengths will never be noticed or encouraged or developed. </p>
<p>At Berkeley (where Bryan went and I taught) and universities generally, the highest praise is <em>brilliant</em>. <em>Professor X is brilliant</em>. Or: <em>Brilliant piece of work</em>. People can do great things in dozens of ways, but somehow student work is almost never judged by how beautiful, courageous, practical, good-tasting, astonishing, vivid, funny, moving, comfortable, and so on it is. Because that&#8217;s not what professors are good at. (Except in the less-academic departments, such as art and engineering.) To fail to grasp that students can excel in dozens of ways is to seriously shortchange them. To value them at much less than they are worth &#8212; and, above all, to fail to help them grow and find their place in the world after college.</p>
<p>At Berkeley, I figured this out in a way that a libertarian should appreciate: <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/whatdostudentswant.pdf">I gave my students much more choice</a>. For a term project, I said they could do almost anything so long as it was off-campus and didn&#8217;t involve library work. What they chose to do revealed a lot. I began to see not just how different they were from me but how different they were from each other. One of my students chose to give a talk to a high-school class. This was astonishing because she has severe stage fright. Every step was hard. But she did it. &#8220;I learned that if I really wanted to, I could conquer my fear,&#8221; she wrote. </p>
<p>One of my Tsinghua students recently asked me: &#8220;Are you a brave man?&#8221; (She wanted to give me a gift of stinky tofu.) I said no. She said she thought I was brave for coming to China. Perhaps. I have never done anything as brave as what my student with stage fright did. I have never done something that terrified me &#8212; much less <strong>chosen</strong> to do such a thing. Her homework hadn&#8217;t been very good. When I read about her term project &#8212; conquering stage fright &#8212; I realized how badly I had misjudged her. How badly I had failed to appreciate her strengths. I saw that it wasn&#8217;t just her and it wasn&#8217;t just me. By imposing just one narrow way to excel, the whole system badly undervalued almost everyone. Almost everyone had strengths the system ignored. And it&#8217;s a system almost everyone must go through to reach a position of power!</p>
<p>This is related to what I call <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/29/duct-tape-the-eurozone-and-neglect-of-innovation/">the hemineglect of economists</a> &#8212; they fail to see that innovation should be half of economics. Diversity of talents and interests is central to innovation because new things are so often mixtures of old things. By rewarding only one kind of talent, colleges suppress diversity of talent and thereby reduce innovation. (It&#8217;s no coincidence that Steve Jobs, whom we associate with innovation, didn&#8217;t finish college. He saw his talents wouldn&#8217;t be valued.) Psychologists are also guilty of this. Many psychologists glorify IQ. Somehow having a high IQ is crucial to success . . . somehow a society that doesn&#8217;t encourage people with high IQs will do badly. And so on. In <em>The Bell Curve</em>, Herrnstein and Murray showed that high IQ scores correlated with other measures of desirable social outcomes (e.g., income &#8212; people with higher IQ scores made more money). Like many successful people, they failed to see the possibility that the whole world had been shaped to reward the things that the people in power (i.e., they themselves) are good at. Not because those talents work (= produce a better economy). But because they are easy to measure (by college grades). The glorification of IQ has had a solipsistic aspect and has ignored what should be obvious, that diversity of talents and skills promotes innovation. Without a diverse talent pool, any society will do a poor job of solving the problems that inevitably arise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1995, I visited my Swedish relatives. We argued about the Euro. They thought it was a good idea, I thought it had a serious weakness.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ME</strong> It ties together economies that are different.</p>
<p><strong>MY AUNT</strong> It reduces the chance of war in Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>You could say we were both right. There have been no wars between Eurozone countries (supporting my aunt) and the Eurozone is now on the verge of breaking apart for exactly the reason I and many others pointed out (supporting me).</p>
<p>Last week a friend said to me that Europe was in worse shape than America. I was unconvinced. I said that I opposed Geithner&#8217;s &#8220;duct-tape solution&#8221;. It would have been better to let things fall apart and then put them back together in a safer way.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MY FRIEND</strong> Duct-tape works.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong> What Geithner did helped those who benefit from the status quo and hurt those who benefit from change. Just like duct tape.</p></blockquote>
<p>This struck me as utterly banal until I read <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21540255">a one-sided editorial in <em>The Economist</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The consequences of the euro’s destruction are so catastrophic that no sensible policymaker could stand by and let it happen. . . .  the threat of a disaster . . . can anything be done to avert disaster?</p></blockquote>
<p>and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/12/05/111205ta_talk_surowiecki">similar remarks in <em>The New Yorker</em></a> (James Surowiecki):</p>
<blockquote><p>The financial crisis in Europe . . . has now entered a potentially disastrous phase.. . . with dire consequences not just for Europe but also for the rest of us. . . . This is that rarest of problems—one that you really can solve just by throwing money at it [= duct tape]</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a sec. What if the Eurozone is a <strong>bad idea</strong>? Like I (and many others) said in 1995? Why perpetuate a bad idea? Why drive further in the wrong direction? Sure, the dissolution will bring temporary trouble (&#8220;disaster&#8221;, &#8220;dire consequences&#8221;), but that will be a small price to pay for getting rid of a bad idea. Of course the Euro had/has pluses and minuses. Anyone who claimed to know that the pluses outweighed the minuses (or vice-verse) was a fool or <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/26/climategate-2-0-behind-the-curtain/">an expert</a>. Now we know more. Given that what the nay-sayers said has come to pass, it is reasonable to think that they (or we) were right: The minuses outweigh the pluses.</p>
<p>You have seen the phrase <em>Japan&#8217;s lost decade</em> a thousand times. You have never seen the phrase <em>Greece&#8217;s lost decade.</em> But Greeks lost an enormous amount from being able to borrow money for stupid conventional projects at too low a rate. Had loans been less available, they would have been more original (the less debt involved, the easier it is to take risks) and started at a smaller scale. Which I believe would have been a better use of their time and led to more innovation. Both <em>The Economist</em>&#8216;s editorial writer and Surowiecki have a status-quo &#8220;duct-tape&#8221; bias without realizing it.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s important here is not what two writers, however influential their magazines, think or fail to think. It is that they are so sure of themselves. They fail to take seriously an alternative (breakup of the Eurozone would in the long run be a good thing) that has at least as much to recommend it as what they are sure of (the breakup would be a &#8220;disaster&#8221;). I believe they are so sure of themselves because they have absorbed (and now imitate) the <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hemineglect">hemineglect</a> of modern economics. The whole field, they haven&#8217;t noticed, has an enormous status-quo bias in its failure to study innovation. Innovation &#8212; how new goods and services are invented and prosper &#8212; should be half the field. Let me repeat: A few years ago I picked up an 800-page introductory economics textbook. It had <strong>one page</strong> (one worthless page) on innovation. In this staggering neglect, it reflected the entire field. The hemineglect of economics professors is just as bad as the hemineglect of epidemiologists (who ignore immune function, study of what makes us better or worse at fighting off microbes) and statisticians (who pay almost no attention to idea generation).</p>
<p><strong>MORE</strong> Even Joe Nocera, whom I like, has trouble grasping that the Euro might be a bad idea. &#8220;The only thing that should matter is what works,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/opinion/nocera-germany-cuts-off-its-nose.html?hp">he writes</a>. Not managing to see that the Euro isn&#8217;t working.</p>
