				<small>Tuesday, April 15th, 2014</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>After I wrote <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/04/13/burnt-sugar-grapefruit-give-thanks-for-south-korea/" target="_blank">my recent post about Korean innovation</a>, I noticed an example in downtown Berkeley. A few months ago, the Korean bakery Paris Baguette opened a branch in a good location (next to a BART station) that has seen two businesses &#8212; two different cafe chains &#8212; fail in the last 5 or 6 years. It seemed to be doing well. There were more customers than I&#8217;d ever seen with the previous business (Tully&#8217;s Coffee). <a href="http://www.parisbaguetteusa.com/" target="_blank">Paris Baguette</a> has about 20 American branches.</p>
<p>Jane Jacobs once called Berkeley a &#8220;pretentious suburb&#8221; but it is where Peet&#8217;s &#8212; the original of Starbucks &#8212; began and where Chez Panisse is. It had a farmer&#8217;s market and an emphasis on organic food long before the rest of America. (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/case-study/organic-food-doesn%E2%80%99t-lower-overall-cancer-risk" target="_blank">A new survey</a> suggests the health benefit of organic food is small or zero.) If you could call a location an &#8220;early adopter&#8221; Berkeley would qualify, but that would be understating it. Via the Free Speech Movement and the whole notion of student protest, little Berkeley shaped an entire decade (the Sixties). But it seems to have been a long time, like half a century, since anything important started here. The Bay Area, however, remains enormously innovative (Google, Twitter, Intel, and so on).</p>

					<p><a href="http://zeynepton.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Good Jobs Strategy</em></a> by Zeynep Ton, published in January, argues that retailers should change low-level jobs in four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer fewer choices &#8212; fewer versions of each product.</li>
<li>Standardize common tasks and empower employees to handle unusual situations.</li>
<li>Cross-train employees so that each employee can do several jobs.</li>
<li>Operate with slack, that is, hire more employees than seemingly necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The brilliance of this book is that it addresses a major problem (bad jobs), includes substantial evidence and persuasive argument, is practical, and is exceedingly non-obvious (judging by how many retailers already follow her recommendations). Ton is an MIT business school professor whose area of expertise is operations.</p>

					<p>Martin Feldman, a Harvard professor of economics and former advisor to President Reagan, is <a href="http://www.higherwages.org/opinion/a-hype-free-way-to-help-low-wage-workers/" target="_blank">against a hike in the minimum wage</a>. One of his arguments:</p>

<p>He &#8212; like most economists &#8212; ignores the point that an increase in the minimum wage, by forcing employers to reexamine familiar practices, will increase innovation.

				<small>Tuesday, December 17th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/06/government-as-useful-irritant-and-rules-of-innovation-what-libertarians-and-other-economists-miss/" target="_blank">a recent post</a> called &#8220;Government as useful irritant&#8221; I said five factors increase innovation: 1. Freedom. 2. Benefit. 3. Resources. 4. Pain. 5. Stability. The effect of government isn&#8217;t simple. It might freedom &#8212; to the extent the coercion outweighs the protection &#8212; and of course corrupt governments make it harder to benefit from your innovation. On the other hand, governments often provide resources, pain and stability. Several of the factors are contradictory &#8212; pain and stability, for example &#8212; which makes it hard to produce optimal conditions, at least without paying attention to what actually happens.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/snowden-and-greenwald-the-men-who-leaked-the-secrets-20131204?print=true" target="_blank">A article I read</a> soon after that (&#8220;Snowden and Greenwald: The Men Who Leaked the Secrets&#8221;) had two relevant examples. One of my points was that increasing inequality reduces innovation bad because it means the people at the top get more and more comfortable, which reduces their desire to innovate. The more inequality, the more of the population falls into two categories: 1. Too poor to innovate (not enough resources). 2. Too comfortable to innovate (not enough pain).</p>
<p>Greenwald saw the value of pain:</p>
<blockquote><p>After graduation, he accepted a job in the litigation department of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz . . . &#8220;I could not thrive or even function in a controlling institution like that. There&#8217;s a huge dichotomy between people who grow up with alienation, which, for me, was invaluable, and people who grow up so completely privileged that it breeds this complacency and lack of desire to question or challenge or do anything significant.</p></blockquote>
<p>Snowden had all five factors in large amounts. He had freedom because his bosses paid him little attention and, because of his IT talent, it was easy to get a job. He also had a lot of money. Obviously he had great resources, including IT talent, knowledge and access. He had pain because he was disgusted by NSA overreach and Obama&#8217;s failure to improve things. He had stability because he had a steady job. The money helped here, too. Because the revelations are so large, he benefits a lot, even if there is also a very big cost.</p>

					<p>Hayek, Keynes, Milton Friedman and Paul Samuelson disagreed about many things but shared one important belief: <em>Their ignorance about innovation didn&#8217;t matter</em>. Countless economics textbooks, which say nothing of interest about innovation, agree with them: <em>ignorance about innovation doesn&#8217;t matter</em>. This belief freed Hayek et al. and textbook writers to make sweeping policy statements. Had they realized that innovation matters, not just productivity &#8212; and, especially, that innovation and productivity are sometimes at odds &#8212; it would have been far less clear what policies are best.  <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/06/government-as-useful-irritant-and-rules-of-innovation-what-libertarians-and-other-economists-miss/#more-12420" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html" target="_blank">a graduation speech</a>, Richard Feynman called certain intellectual endeavors &#8220;cargo cult science,&#8221; meaning they had the trappings of science but not the substance. One thing he criticized was rat psychology. He was wrong about that. Sure, as Feynman complained, lots of rat psychology experiments have led nowhere, just as lots of books aren&#8217;t good. But you need to publish lots of bad books to support the infrastructure necessary to publish a few good ones. The same is true of rat psychology experiments. A few are very good. The bad make possible the good. Rat psychology experiments, especially those by Israel Ramirez and Anthony Sclafani, led me to a new theory of weight control, which led me to the Shangri-La Diet.</p>
<p>Cargo cult science does exist.  The most important modern example is evidence-based medicine. Notice how ritualistic it is and how little progress medicine has made since it became popular. An evidence-based medicine review of tonsillectomies <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html" target="_blank">failed to realize they were worse than voodoo</a>. Voodoo, unlike a tonsillectomy, does not damage your immune system. The evidence-based medicine reviewers appeared not to know that tonsils are part of the immune system. Year after year, the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology tells the world, between the lines of the press release, that once again medical researchers have failed to make progress on any major disease, as the prize is always given for work with little or no practical value. In the 1950s, the polio vaccine was progress; so was figuring out that smoking causes lung cancer (which didn&#8217;t get a Nobel Prize). There have been no comparable advances since then. Researchers at top medical schools remain profoundly unaware of what causes heart disease, most cancers, depression, bipolar disorder, obesity, diabetes and so on.</p>
<p>I came across cargo-cult thinking recently in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming" target="_blank">a talk by Neil Gaiman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was in China in 2007, at the first party-approved science fiction and fantasy convention in Chinese history. And at one point I took a top official aside and asked him Why? SF had been disapproved of for a long time. What had changed?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple, he told me. The Chinese were brilliant at making things if other people brought them the plans. But they did not innovate and they did not invent. They did not imagine. So they sent a delegation to the US, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Google, and they asked the people there who were inventing the future about themselves. And they found that all of them had read science fiction when they were boys or girls.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know about Chinese engineers at Microsoft and Google in Beijing. They want to leave the country. An American friend, who worked at Microsoft, was surprised by the unanimity of their desire to leave. I wasn&#8217;t surprised. Why innovate or invent if the government might seize your company? Which is the main point of <em>Why Nations Fail</em>. Allowing science fiction in China doesn&#8217;t change that.</p>

					<p>Big public works projects inevitably cost far more than the original budget. I heard a talk about this a few years ago. The speaker gave many examples, including Boston&#8217;s Big Dig. His explanation was that these projects would not be approved if voters were told the truth. The German <del>newspaper</del> magazine <em>Der </em><em>Spiegel</em> has just published <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/de-meuron-von-gerkan-and-ingenhoven-on-german-construction-headaches-a-905472.html" target="_blank">an interview with several architects</a> responsible for recent German projects with especially large discrepancies between what people were told at the beginning and the unfolding reality &#8212; Berlin&#8217;s new airport, for example. The article&#8217;s headline calls them &#8220;debacles&#8221;. One architect gives the same explanation as the speaker I heard: &#8220;The pure truth doesn&#8217;t get you far in this business. The opera house in Sydney would never have been approved if they had known how much it would cost from the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree. I see the same massive underestimation of time and effort in projects that I do and that my colleagues and friends do, projects we do for ourselves that require no one&#8217;s approval. I think something will take an hour. It takes five hours. Plainly the world is more complicated than our mental model of it, sure, but there is more to it than that. Someone did a survey of people in Maryland who had been in a car accident so bad they had had to go to the hospital. Within only a year, a large fraction of them (half?) had forgotten about it. When asked if within the last year they had had an accident so bad they were hospitalized, they said no. Apparently we forget difficulties, even extreme ones, really fast. If you forget difficulties, you will underestimate them.</p>
<p><em>If I had realized how difficult everything would be, I couldn&#8217;t have done any of it</em> is one explanation, which I&#8217;ve heard attributed to Gregory Bateson. From <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2013/06/24/130624crbo_books_gladwell" target="_blank">Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s excellent review</a> in this week&#8217;s <em>New Yorker</em> of a biography of Albert Hirschman, the economist, I learned that Hirschman &#8212; had he realized that this was human nature &#8212; would have had a different evolutionary explanation: We underestimate difficulties because this way of thinking increases innovation. <span style="font-size: 13px;">Debacle . . . or opportunity? </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">Difficulty is the mother of invention. </span></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Is online teaching (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOC</a>) a big deal? In <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2012/11/12/alex-tabarrok/why-online-education-works/" target="_blank">an essay</a> (&#8220;Why Online Education Works&#8221;), Alex Tabarrok argues for the value of online education (meaning online lectures) compared to traditional lectures. A friend told me yesterday that MOOC was &#8220;a frontier of pedagogy&#8221;. No doubt online lectures will make lecture classes cheaper and more available. Lots of things have gone from scarce/expensive to common/cheap. With things whose effects we understand (e.g., combs), the result is straightforward: more people benefit. With things whose effects we don&#8217;t understand, the results are less predictable. Did the spread of sugar help us? Hard to say. Did the spread of antibiotics help us? Hard to say.  It may have helped sustain simplistic ideas about what causes disease (e.g., &#8220;acne is caused by bacteria&#8221;, &#8220;ulcers are caused by bacteria&#8221;) reducing effective innovation. Do we have a good idea of the effects of lectures (or their lack of effect), or a good theory of college education? I don&#8217;t think so. Could their spread help sustain simplistic ideas about education? Maybe. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/12/09/online-teaching-versus-what/#more-8169" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/bad-pharma-by-ben-goldacre.html" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen</a> links to <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w18552#fromrss" target="_blank">a paper by Frank Lichtenberg</a>, an economist at Columbia University, that tries to estimate the benefits of drug company innovation by estimating how much new drugs prolong life compared to older drugs. The paper compares people equated in a variety of ways except the &#8220;vintage&#8221; (date of approval) of the drugs they take. <em>Does taking newer drugs increase life-span?</em> is the question Lichtenberg wants to answer. He concludes they do. He says his findings &#8220;suggest that two-thirds of the 0.6-year increase in the life expectancy of elderly Americans during 1996-2003 was due to the increase in drug vintage&#8221; &#8212; that is, to newer drugs.</p>
<p>An obvious problem is that Lichtenberg has not controlled for health-consciousness. This is <a href="http://geography.ssc.uwo.ca/faculty/baxter/readings/Taubes_limits_epidemiology_Science_1995.pdf" target="_blank">a standard epidemiological point</a>. People who adopt Conventional Healthy Behavior X (e.g., eat less fat) are more likely to adopt Conventional Healthy Behavior Y (e.g., find a better doctor) than those who don&#8217;t. For example, a study found that people who drink a proper amount of wine eat more vegetables. Another reason for a correlation between conventionally-healthy practices is mild depression. People who are mildly depressed are less likely to do twenty different helpful things (including &#8220;eat healthy&#8221; and &#8220;find a better doctor&#8221;) than people who are not mildly depressed. (And mild depression seems to be common.) Perhaps doctors differ. (Lichtenberg concludes there are big differences.) Perhaps better doctors (a) prescribe more recent drugs and (b) do other things that benefit their patients. Lichtenberg does not discuss these possibilities.</p>
<p>A subtle problem with Lichtenberg&#8217;s conclusion that we benefit from drug company innovation is that drug-company-like thinking &#8212; the notion that health problems should be &#8220;solved&#8221; with drugs &#8212; interferes with a better way of thinking: the notion that to solve a health problem, we should find out what aspects of the environment cause it. I suppose this is why we have Schools of Public Health &#8212; because this way of thinking, advocated at schools of public health, is so incompatible with what is said and done at medical schools. Public health thinking has a clear and impressive track record &#8212; for example, the disappearance of infectious disease as a major source of death. There are plenty of other examples: the drop in lung cancer after it was discovered that smoking causes lung cancer, the drop in birth defects after it was discovered that folate deficiency causes birth defects. Thinking centered on drugs has done nothing so helpful. Spending enormous amounts of money to develop new drugs shifts resources away from more cost-effective research: about environmental causes and prevention. Someone should ask the directors of the Susan K. Komen Foundation: Why &#8220;race for the cure&#8221;? Wouldn&#8217;t spending the money on prevention research save more lives?</p>

					<p>Ecologists understand the exploit/explore distinction. When an animal looks for food, it can either exploit (use previous knowledge of where food is) or explore (try to learn more about where food is). With ants, the difference is visible. Trail of ants to a food source: exploit. Solitary wandering ant: explore. With other animals, the difference is more subtle. You might think that when a rat presses a bar for food, that is pure exploitation. However, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0k16r0pt">my colleagues and I found that when expectation of food was lower, there was more variation</a> &#8212; more exploration &#8212; in <em>how</em> the rat pressed the bar. In a wide range of domains (genetics, business), less expectation of reward leads to more exploration.  In business, this is a common observation. For example, yesterday I read <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2012/04/washington-post-watergate">an article about the <em>Washington Post</em></a> that said its leaders failed to explore enough because they had a false sense of security provide by their Kaplan branch. &#8220;Thanks to Kaplan, the Post Company felt less pressure to make hard strategic choices—and less pressure to venture in new directions,&#8221; wrote Sarah Ellison.</p>
<p>Striking the right balance between exploitation and exploration is crucial. If an animal exploits too much, it will starve when its supply of food runs out. If it explores too much, it will starve right away. Every instance of collapse in Jared Diamond&#8217;s <em>Collapse: How Socieities Choose to Fail or Succeed</em> was plausibly due to too much exploitation, too little exploration (which Diamond, even though he is a biologist, fails to say). I&#8217;ve posted several times about my discovery that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/walking-and-learning/">treadmill walking made studying Chinese more pleasant</a>. I believe walking creates a thirst for dry knowledge. My evolutionary explanation is that this pushed prehistoric humans to explore more.</p>
<p>I have never heard an economist make this point: the need for proper balance between exploit and explore.  <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/01/two-dimensions-of-economic-growth-gdp-and-useful-knowledge/#more-7683" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>In a Planet Money show about whether Super Bowls help host cities, a sports economist named <a href="http://college.holycross.edu/faculty/vmatheso/">Victor Matheson</a>, a professor at College of the Holy Cross, described himself and other sports economists:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re economists. And we&#8217;re concerned about equity and we&#8217;re concerned about efficiency. And what most economists see . . . &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>He <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> say &#8220;We&#8217;re concerned about innovation&#8221;. The way he ignores innovation reflects the whole field of economics. Here&#8217;s the same thing from Christine Romer. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/business/do-manufacturers-need-special-treatment-economic-view.html?_r=2">an editorial about whether manufacturing deserves special treatment</a>, she considers only productivity and equity:</p>
<blockquote><p>It might be better to enact policies that will make all American businesses and workers more productive and successful. . . Today, we face a profound shortfall of demand. . . .We need actions that raise overall demand. [She doesn't say we are in a period of profound stagnation in most industries, which is also true.] . . . More aggressive monetary policy that lowered the price of the dollar would stimulate all our exports . . . Moving is very costly for dislocated workers with ties to their communities. . . Manufacturing jobs are seen as one of the few sources of well-paying jobs for less-educated workers. . . . Public policy . . . should be based on hard evidence of market failures, and reliable data on the proposals’ impact on jobs and income inequality.</p></blockquote>
<p>As if innovation (and lack of it) don&#8217;t exist. Here&#8217;s an example from Robert Reich, in <a href="http://robertreich.org/post/11329289033">a post &#8220;rebut[ing] the seven biggest economic lies&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Shrinking government generates more jobs</em>. Wrong again. It means fewer government workers – everyone from teachers, fire fighters, police officers, and social workers at the state and local levels to safety inspectors and military personnel at the federal. And fewer government contractors, who would employ fewer private-sector workers. According to Moody’s economist Mark Zandi (a campaign advisor to John McCain), the $61 billion in spending cuts proposed by the House GOP will cost the economy 700,000 jobs this year and next.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing about the effect of shrinking government on innovation. Many types of innovation increase jobs.</p>
<p>This is like <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html">doctors ignoring the immune system</a>. Ignoring the effect of this or that policy on innovation is likely to lead to decisions that reduce innovation in favor of something easier to measure or defend, such as productivity or equity. The cumulative effect of ignoring innovation is stagnation and decline, caused by problems that got worse and worse as, due to lack of innovation, they failed to be solved.</p>
<p>Tyler Cowen (<em>The Great Stagnation</em>) and Alex Tabarrok (<em>Launching the Innovation Renaissance</em>) are absolutely right to focus on innovation and the lack of it. The obesity epidemic is 30 years old &#8212; a good example of a problem that has gotten worse and worse. Judging by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/tara-parker-pope-fat-trap.html?pagewanted=all">Tara Parker-Pope&#8217;s reporting</a>, mainstream weight researchers don&#8217;t have a clue &#8212; in the form of empirical results &#8212; how to solve it. Outside mainstream academia, the dominant weight-loss idea is a low-carb diet. That idea is a hundred years old (Banting). How little innovation there has been. That Parker-Pope failed to criticize researchers for their lack of progress shows how deep the problem is. She appears not to grasp the possibility.</p>

That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here at this fascinating conference.&#8221; In spite of this topic, his talk contains nothing about what controls the rate of innovation.

It&#8217;s as if a Harvard Medical School professor spoke about how to fight disease without mentioning the immune system, without even appearing to know that the immune system exists.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/the_magic_of_ed.html">this post</a>, Bryan Caplan says (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/03/24/agrees-with-me-about-college/">again</a>) that college is vastly overrated. Like me, he says that the only thing college professors know how to do is be professors and that is all they can actually teach. Graduate school, where professors teach students who want to be professors, makes sense. Undergraduate school, where almost no students will become professors, does not. Like me, he ridicules the idea that professors teach students &#8220;how to think&#8221;. </p>
<p>He omits half of my criticism. It isn&#8217;t just teaching (&#8220;how to think&#8221; &#8212; please!), it&#8217;s also evaluation. Professors are terrible at evaluation. Their method of judging student work is very simple: <em>How close is it to what I would have done?</em> The better you can imitate the professor, no matter what the class, the higher your grade. This is <em>one size fits all</em> with a vengeance because there is no opting out. Sure, you can choose your major. But every class is taught by a professor. What if your strengths lie elsewhere &#8212; in something that your professors aren&#8217;t good at? Tough luck. Your strengths will never be noticed or encouraged or developed. </p>
<p>At Berkeley (where Bryan went and I taught) and universities generally, the highest praise is <em>brilliant</em>. <em>Professor X is brilliant</em>. Or: <em>Brilliant piece of work</em>. People can do great things in dozens of ways, but somehow student work is almost never judged by how beautiful, courageous, practical, good-tasting, astonishing, vivid, funny, moving, comfortable, and so on it is. Because that&#8217;s not what professors are good at. (Except in the less-academic departments, such as art and engineering.) To fail to grasp that students can excel in dozens of ways is to seriously shortchange them. To value them at much less than they are worth &#8212; and, above all, to fail to help them grow and find their place in the world after college.</p>
<p>At Berkeley, I figured this out in a way that a libertarian should appreciate: <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/whatdostudentswant.pdf">I gave my students much more choice</a>. For a term project, I said they could do almost anything so long as it was off-campus and didn&#8217;t involve library work. What they chose to do revealed a lot. I began to see not just how different they were from me but how different they were from each other. One of my students chose to give a talk to a high-school class. This was astonishing because she has severe stage fright. Every step was hard. But she did it. &#8220;I learned that if I really wanted to, I could conquer my fear,&#8221; she wrote. </p>
<p>One of my Tsinghua students recently asked me: &#8220;Are you a brave man?&#8221; (She wanted to give me a gift of stinky tofu.) I said no. She said she thought I was brave for coming to China. Perhaps. I have never done anything as brave as what my student with stage fright did. I have never done something that terrified me &#8212; much less <strong>chosen</strong> to do such a thing. Her homework hadn&#8217;t been very good. When I read about her term project &#8212; conquering stage fright &#8212; I realized how badly I had misjudged her. How badly I had failed to appreciate her strengths. I saw that it wasn&#8217;t just her and it wasn&#8217;t just me. By imposing just one narrow way to excel, the whole system badly undervalued almost everyone. Almost everyone had strengths the system ignored. And it&#8217;s a system almost everyone must go through to reach a position of power!</p>
<p>This is related to what I call <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/29/duct-tape-the-eurozone-and-neglect-of-innovation/">the hemineglect of economists</a> &#8212; they fail to see that innovation should be half of economics. Diversity of talents and interests is central to innovation because new things are so often mixtures of old things. By rewarding only one kind of talent, colleges suppress diversity of talent and thereby reduce innovation. (It&#8217;s no coincidence that Steve Jobs, whom we associate with innovation, didn&#8217;t finish college. He saw his talents wouldn&#8217;t be valued.) Psychologists are also guilty of this. Many psychologists glorify IQ. Somehow having a high IQ is crucial to success . . . somehow a society that doesn&#8217;t encourage people with high IQs will do badly. And so on. In <em>The Bell Curve</em>, Herrnstein and Murray showed that high IQ scores correlated with other measures of desirable social outcomes (e.g., income &#8212; people with higher IQ scores made more money). Like many successful people, they failed to see the possibility that the whole world had been shaped to reward the things that the people in power (i.e., they themselves) are good at. Not because those talents work (= produce a better economy). But because they are easy to measure (by college grades). The glorification of IQ has had a solipsistic aspect and has ignored what should be obvious, that diversity of talents and skills promotes innovation. Without a diverse talent pool, any society will do a poor job of solving the problems that inevitably arise.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In 1995, I visited my Swedish relatives. We argued about the Euro. They thought it was a good idea, I thought it had a serious weakness.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ME</strong> It ties together economies that are different.</p>
<p><strong>MY AUNT</strong> It reduces the chance of war in Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>You could say we were both right. There have been no wars between Eurozone countries (supporting my aunt) and the Eurozone is now on the verge of breaking apart for exactly the reason I and many others pointed out (supporting me).</p>
<p>Last week a friend said to me that Europe was in worse shape than America. I was unconvinced. I said that I opposed Geithner&#8217;s &#8220;duct-tape solution&#8221;. It would have been better to let things fall apart and then put them back together in a safer way.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MY FRIEND</strong> Duct-tape works.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong> What Geithner did helped those who benefit from the status quo and hurt those who benefit from change. Just like duct tape.</p></blockquote>
<p>This struck me as utterly banal until I read <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21540255">a one-sided editorial in <em>The Economist</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The consequences of the euro’s destruction are so catastrophic that no sensible policymaker could stand by and let it happen. . . .  the threat of a disaster . . . can anything be done to avert disaster?</p></blockquote>
<p>and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/12/05/111205ta_talk_surowiecki">similar remarks in <em>The New Yorker</em></a> (James Surowiecki):</p>
<blockquote><p>The financial crisis in Europe . . . has now entered a potentially disastrous phase.. . . with dire consequences not just for Europe but also for the rest of us. . . . This is that rarest of problems—one that you really can solve just by throwing money at it [= duct tape]</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait a sec. What if the Eurozone is a <strong>bad idea</strong>? Like I (and many others) said in 1995? Why perpetuate a bad idea? Why drive further in the wrong direction? Sure, the dissolution will bring temporary trouble (&#8220;disaster&#8221;, &#8220;dire consequences&#8221;), but that will be a small price to pay for getting rid of a bad idea. Of course the Euro had/has pluses and minuses. Anyone who claimed to know that the pluses outweighed the minuses (or vice-verse) was a fool or <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/26/climategate-2-0-behind-the-curtain/">an expert</a>. Now we know more. Given that what the nay-sayers said has come to pass, it is reasonable to think that they (or we) were right: The minuses outweigh the pluses.</p>
<p>You have seen the phrase <em>Japan&#8217;s lost decade</em> a thousand times. You have never seen the phrase <em>Greece&#8217;s lost decade.</em> But Greeks lost an enormous amount from being able to borrow money for stupid conventional projects at too low a rate. Had loans been less available, they would have been more original (the less debt involved, the easier it is to take risks) and started at a smaller scale. Which I believe would have been a better use of their time and led to more innovation. Both <em>The Economist</em>&#8216;s editorial writer and Surowiecki have a status-quo &#8220;duct-tape&#8221; bias without realizing it.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s important here is not what two writers, however influential their magazines, think or fail to think. It is that they are so sure of themselves. They fail to take seriously an alternative (breakup of the Eurozone would in the long run be a good thing) that has at least as much to recommend it as what they are sure of (the breakup would be a &#8220;disaster&#8221;). I believe they are so sure of themselves because they have absorbed (and now imitate) the <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hemineglect">hemineglect</a> of modern economics. The whole field, they haven&#8217;t noticed, has an enormous status-quo bias in its failure to study innovation. Innovation &#8212; how new goods and services are invented and prosper &#8212; should be half the field. Let me repeat: A few years ago I picked up an 800-page introductory economics textbook. It had <strong>one page</strong> (one worthless page) on innovation. In this staggering neglect, it reflected the entire field. The hemineglect of economics professors is just as bad as the hemineglect of epidemiologists (who ignore immune function, study of what makes us better or worse at fighting off microbes) and statisticians (who pay almost no attention to idea generation).</p>
<p><strong>MORE</strong> Even Joe Nocera, whom I like, has trouble grasping that the Euro might be a bad idea. &#8220;The only thing that should matter is what works,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/opinion/nocera-germany-cuts-off-its-nose.html?hp">he writes</a>. Not managing to see that the Euro isn&#8217;t working.</p>
