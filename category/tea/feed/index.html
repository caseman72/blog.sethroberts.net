				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I discovered the Shangri-La Diet (2000), I started drinking lots of tea. Tea has smell without calories, which complemented the calories without smell of the diet. Mostly I drink black tea &#8212; more complexity than green or oolong tea. Until recently, I made it the usual (Western) way. 1. Add hot water to tea. 2. Wait 3-4 minutes. 3. Add cream and sweetener. 4. Drink. 5. Throw away tea.<br />
<span id="more-13090"></span><br />
Now I do this: 1. Rinse tea with hot water, discard rinse water. 2. Add hot water. 3. Wait short time (e.g., 30 seconds). 4. Taste the results in a certain way. 5. Drink. 6. Reinfuse tea for longer time (e.g., 45 seconds). And so on. From 2.5 g of tea leaves I make 3 cups of tea (200 ml each), with infusion times of 35, 55 and 90 seconds. I drink the first two cups straight (no additions), then add sweetener (xylitol), salt and cream to the third cup. It&#8217;s like three different sorts of tea. The first cup is a little sweet, the second cup is slightly bitter with more complexity, the third cup has bitterness, complexity, fat (cream) and sweetness. I use <a href="http://www.polder.com/shop/measuring-temperature/timers/3-in-1-timer-clock-amp-stopwatch-1" target="_blank">a Polder timer</a> that, at the end of the interval, resets to the length of the interval. For example, if you time 30 seconds, it ends up reset to 30 seconds. This makes it easy to remember the length of the last infusion.</p>
<p>What interests me is Step #4: &#8220;Taste the results in a certain way.&#8221; After brewing the tea, I pour a little of it into a small glass. I have four of them. I pour the tea from #1 to #2 to #3 to #4. This greatly cools it, making it much easier to assess the taste. If you drink the tea before cooling, the heat is distracting. As soon as I started doing this, it was easy to see that short infusion times (e.g., 30 seconds) gave better results than long infusion times (e.g., 3 minutes) and that the tea could be used several times. I could easily distinguish between a brewing time of 30 seconds and 40 seconds. </p>
<p>Without Step #4, you (or at least me) are in very bad shape. Soon after brewing, the tea is too hot to taste clearly. The heat is distracting. Within a few sips, however, taste adaptation is so strong you cannot taste it clearly either. This is why I drank tea for 13 years without understanding what is going on.</p>
<p>With the particular black tea I am drinking now, the first 30 seconds or so of infusion releases a slightly-sweet tasting chemical. If I cold-brew tea, this is what it will taste like. After that comes more complexity but also more bitterness. All in all, I like more bitterness (not too much) and complexity, so I reduced the amount of tea from 2.5 g to 2.0 g and increased the first infusion time to 60 seconds. That produced better results.</p>
<p>For many years, in other words, (a) I brewed it wrong then added cream and sweetener to fix my mistake and (b) due to poor feedback I had no idea what I was doing. Does that remind you of anything?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seth Brown, a &#8220;data scientist&#8221; with a Ph.D. in computational genomics, has done several experiments <a href="http://www.drbunsen.org/coffee-experiments/" target="_blank">about the best way to make coffee</a>. In one, he compared other people&#8217;s burr grinders to his blade grinder. There was no clear difference in taste. In another, an Aeropress apparently produced better-tasting coffee than drip extraction. He hasn&#8217;t found other factors that matter. If I drank coffee, I&#8217;d be happy to know these things.</p>
<p>If I were teaching how to do experiments, his work would be a good case study. I&#8217;d have my students read it and suggest improvements. The contrast between his data analysis (sophisticated) and experimental design (unsophisticated) is striking, maybe because he has no background in experimentation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I would have done differently:<span id="more-11829"></span></p>
<p>1. <strong>Study my reactions, not the reactions of guests</strong>. He had house guests rate the coffee he made. Yet he brews coffee for himself much more often than for others &#8212; at least, he gives that impression. Since his main customer is himself, it wasn&#8217;t clear why other people&#8217;s opinions are more important than his opinion. Maybe he read somewhere that blinding is good and thought it would be easier to achieve if other people did the ratings. He could have rated coffee he made himself blinded. Put stickers on the bottom of identical cups, shuffle the cups. However, since he will usually make coffee unblinded (he will know how he made it), it isn&#8217;t clear that blinding is good.</p>
<p>2. <strong>No &#8220;control&#8221; experiments</strong>. In a &#8220;control&#8221; experiment, he asked guests which of two identically-made cups of coffee was better. He doesn&#8217;t say what he learned from this &#8212; apparently nothing.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Simultaneous presentation</strong>. He gave guests two cups of coffee made differently and asked which they preferred. Apparently he gave them one cup at a time. Simultaneous presentation, allowing them to go back and forth, would have allowed much better discrimination. Maybe the two types of grinder differed but his experiment was too noisy to detect this.</p>
<p>In a footnote he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ideally, I would have liked to use better control conditions [he appears to realize that there was something wrong with his control experiment -- SR], larger sample sizes, more thorough subject randomization [I have no idea what this means; his designs are within-subject. In within-subject experiments, subjects are not randomized -- SR], and a more consistent testing environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of these changes would have made his experiments more difficult. Maybe he has internalized the rule <em>harder is better</em>.</p>
<p>The beginning of wisdom about science is roughly the opposite: <em>do the simplest easiest thing that will tell you something</em>. We always know less than we think, so make as few assumptions and as little investment as possible. The easier your experiment, the less you will lose if you make a wrong assumption. The smaller your sample size, the more resources (time, money, subjects, energy) you will have left over for other experiments. Bunsen&#8217;s experiments would have been easier if he had studied himself. By studying others, he made an untested assumption that they resembled him.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done dozens of tea experiments in which I compared tea brewed two different ways. The main things I&#8217;ve learned, besides best brew times and best amounts of tea to use, are: 1. Rinse tea before brewing.  It eliminates a kind of dirty taste. 2. Combine <a href="http://tisano.com/" target="_blank">chocolate tea</a> and black tea. The combination is better than either alone. 3. A little bit of salt helps.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I interviewed Patrick Pineda about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/11/how-things-begin-tisano-tea/" target="_blank">how Tisano Tea began</a>, he gave me several tins of chocolate tea, their main product. Since then, I&#8217;ve had dozens of cups of chocolate tea. It&#8217;s a good caffeine-free drink, especially with cream.</p>
<p>My main use of chocolate tea, however, has been to improve black tea. Black tea + chocolate tea = great drink, better than any black tea alone or chocolate tea alone. So much better that I have stopped drinking black tea the usual way (without chocolate tea). Even cheap black tea (e.g., Lipton&#8217;s) plus chocolate tea tastes better than expensive black tea. I think I know why. Black tea (fermented) has a complex flavor, like most fermented foods. Expensive black tea is more complex than cheap black tea, but only a little more. Likewise, chocolate tea has a complex flavor (like chocolate). Combining two sources of substantial complexity produces tea with great complexity &#8212; much more than you can get by tweaking one source of complexity (e.g., varying black tea).<span id="more-10675"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a recipe:</p>
<p>1. To 2.0 g of black tea and 0.9 g of chocolate tea add 8 oz of boiling water. Brew 4 minutes.</p>
<p>2. Add cream and sugar to taste.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.peets.com/" target="_blank">Peet&#8217;s</a> tea designers may have reached a similar conclusion.  Peet&#8217;s sells limited-edition teas that are available for only a few months, one at a time. Several months ago the limited-edition tea was Red Cloud Cacao, which combined black tea, chocolate tea, and rooibos. The chocolate tea was from Tisano. I loved it. It sold surprisingly well, I&#8217;m told. Their next limited-edition tea, still available, is <a href="http://www.peets.com/anniversary-breakfast-blend-tea-4-oz.html" target="_blank">Anniversary Breakfast Blend</a>. Here&#8217;s what the tin says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We seek out small lot teas with unique characters and intriguing flavors . . . Then . . . we set out to make great teas even better . . . We artfully marry the elements of distinctive black teas until we have achieved a well-balanced, extraordinarily aromatic, and flavorful cup.</p></blockquote>
<p>I told a Peet&#8217;s customer service person how much I liked the combination of black and chocolate tea. <em>That&#8217;s funny</em>, she said, <em>the Anniversary Breakfast Blend is made by adding a chocolate mist to black tea.</em> The blended teas are misted with chocolate. The website and the container say nothing about this. My guess is that the tea designers came to the same conclusion as me. Chocolate was so potent they couldn&#8217;t bear to omit it. But they couldn&#8217;t simply add chocolate tea to the blend, because that would repeat Red Cloud Cacao, appear formulaic, and spoil the story of &#8220;seek[ing] out small lot teas&#8221;. It would also be obvious: You could look at the tea and see the chocolate. So they used chocolate mist and didn&#8217;t tell customers. What the tin says is doughnut truth: The whole truth, nothing but the truth, with a hole in the truth.</p>
<p>Complexity is much different than other sources of pleasure in food (salty, sweet, chewy, etc.). <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/01/08/the-limits-of-expert-trial-and-error/" target="_blank">My explorations</a> suggest we can detect a lot more complexity that you can get from a single fermented food. But I have yet to encounter a single recipe that combines fermented foods. Most professional recipes produce complexity via many spices, which is labor-intensive (you need to add and adjust all those spices, and worry about their age) and, in my experience, produces no better results than adding one fermented flavoring, such as miso.</p>
<p><a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=682750" target="_blank">Salting tea</a> also seems to improve it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://tisano.com/" target="_blank">Tisano Tea</a>, based in San Francisco, sells chocolate tea. It was started in 2010 by Patrick Pineda, Leonardo Zambrano, and Lucas Azpurua. I was curious about the company because I like two chocolate tea blends very much: Red Cloud Cacao (a black tea/chocolate tea blend from Peet’s, no longer available but they will bring it back) and CocoMate (from <a href="http://www.americantearoom.com/" target="_blank">American Tea Room</a>).<span id="more-10390"></span></p>
<p>Patrick’s father was an ambassador from Venezuela. Patrick grew up in California and England and went to college at the University of East Anglia. After studying for a Master’s in Film Production from Columbia University (New York), he started working for Al Jazerra in Venezuela making documentaries. He also worked for a local TV station making segments for a children’s program. One segment was about cacao. He learned that Venezuelan cacao beans were among the most highly-valued cacao beans in the world. The cacao beans from one valley (Chuao) sold for ten times the usual price.</p>
<p>While making the segment, he met cacao farmers. He discovered a group of cacao farmers whose beans had been organically certified by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) due to local NGO sponsorship (the NGO paid for it). The farmers saw it as free training. The organic certification took lots of paperwork to maintain. The farmers had hoped that the certification would allow them to sell their beans at a premium. However, after four years, this hadn’t yet happened. At the end of each harvest, they’d had to sell their beans at the conventional (non-organic) price.</p>
<p>This struck Patrick as an opportunity – a niche (organic) within a niche (Venezualan). In the US, there was a growing demand for organic products. The co-op grew about 16 metric tons of organic cacao beans each year. In 2009, with the financial help of his older brother and friends, he bought 10 metric tons ($40,000). A month earlier, he hadn’t known that chocolate comes from cacao.</p>
<p>He soon realized there was a problem: How to get it out of the country? If taken straight out, the government would fumigate it and it would lose its organic certification. It would have to be processed in Venezuela. There were several cacao processing plants in Venezuela but to them 10 metric tons was nothing. Patrick finally convinced one of them that organic might be the future. He taught the employees how to process the beans organically while learning it himself. After that it was relatively easy to get the processing plant certified organic.</p>
<p>During processing, 12% of the weight is “lost” in shells that are normally discarded. Patrick took the shells with him back to America hoping he could do something with them. In Venezuela, he had met an indigenous tribal community that drank tea made from cacao shells as remedy for asthma and to sooth coughs. He looked academic journals for other uses. He eventually found about 120 published papers. The shells had been used as toothpaste and to increase the Vitamin D content of milk by feeding them to cows. The only common uses, it turned out, were as fertilizer (due to the nitrogen content) and animal feed (due to the fiber and Vitamin D content). Neither use was high-price.</p>
<p>What about tea? Patrick sent samples to his partners. They were unenthusiastic. “This tastes like grass. Why would anybody drink tea from a by-product?” However, he was selling chocolate butter and nibs online. With each order, he included an 8-ounce pouch of cacao shells with instructions how to brew the tea. His customers – at least, some of them – were enthusiastic: <em>How unique, how great</em>, they emailed him. A German woman said she hadn’t drunk such tea since World War II ended. During World War II, cacao shells had been added to tea to extend it. His customers wanted to buy more.</p>
<p>He convinced his partners to go to a trade show. In 2010, they went to Expo West, a natural and healthy food product show in Anaheim. Out of all of their products, the tea got the most attention. It won Best in Show for tea. Out of about 500 new products, it was one of four that won Best New Product of Show. People from Twinings Tea and Stash Tea complimented them on their product.</p>
<p>After the trade show, Patrick decided the tea was a good concept and decided to make it a separate brand. Dark chocolate without the guilt. No sugar, no caffeine. He launched Tisano. The name comes from <em>tisane</em> (herbal tea in French) and <em>artesano</em> (artisanal in Spanish).</p>
<p>When I tasted Tisano’s chocolate tea, it tasted very familiar. That’s because Tisano’s cacao shells are the cacao shells in both American Tea Room’s CocoMate and Peet’s Red Cloud Cacao. There is no doubt that Patrick has created a new niche within the American (and maybe world) tea market: chocolate tea. I don’t know how well CocoMate is selling at American Tea Room but I decided to buy it after smelling maybe 40 teas. At Peet’s, Red Cloud Cacao sold surprisingly well and they will bring it back seasonally.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started drinking lots of tea when I started the Shangri-La Diet. The diet made me crave food with smell, which tea provided. I started chewing gum, too, but that was less enjoyable, maybe because I never became a gum connoisseur.</p>
<p>I recently learned about <a href="http://teeccino.com/" target="_blank">Teeccino</a> coffee-substitute &#8220;tees&#8221; (brewed like tea) from Patrick Pineda of <a href="http://tisano.com/" target="_blank">Tisano</a>. They resemble <a href="http://internaturalfoods.com/brands/pero.html" target="_blank">Pero</a> but with more flavor and variety. I really liked the first two flavors I tried (Vanilla Nut and French Roast) so I wrote to Teeccino asking for samples of all the flavors. In addition to no caffeine, Teechino drinks are high in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin" target="_blank">inulin</a>, a soluble fiber.</p>
<p>Here are my comments on the samples.</p>
<p><strong>Dandelion Dark Roast</strong>. Similar to French Roast (relatively strong coffee taste) but more earthy-tasting. Maybe that&#8217;s the dandelion.</p>
<p><strong>French Vanilla</strong>. Strong vanilla taste. Too much like vanilla for me, I want something more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Caramel Nut</strong>. Halfway between  caramel and burnt caramel, which I like. As complex as French Roast.</p>
<p><strong>Mocha</strong>. Excellent. Complexity of coffee plus complexity of chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>Chocolate</strong>. Like mocha, except darker coffee flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Original</strong>. Excellent. Weaker coffee flavor plus fruity complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Almond Amaretto</strong>. Wonderful combination of coffee flavor with nutty almond/amaretto flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Java</strong>. Rounded coffee flavor.</p>
<p><b>Chocolate Mint</b>. Enough mint but not enough chocolate and coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Southern Pecan</strong>. Delicious. Pecan and coffee flavors well-balanced. I wonder: What does Northern Pecan taste like?</p>
<p><strong>Maya Chai</strong>. Tastes like chai. I would prefer, in addition, a dark coffee taste.</p>

<blockquote><p>Entertainment news is like drinking tea, first time is like washing tea leafs, no one really cares. Maybe 2nd or 3rd time it will have the sweet taste, but in the end it gets weaker and weaker.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I wondered if I drink too much tea. Is 4 cups/day too much? What about 2 cups/day? To learn more, I needed to drink a lot less tea.</p>
<p><em>What about miso?</em> I wondered. I had some high-quality miso paste in my refrigerator. I got it in Tokyo at <a href="http://foodpia.geocities.jp/man9miso/">a miso store</a> (thanks to Gary Rymar for taking me there). I made a cup (about 25 g miso paste &#8212; 2-3 teaspoons? &#8212; mixed with 1 cup hot water).  It was delicious. The complex taste reminded me of coffee and chocolate. I added a little cream and a half packet of sweetener (Sucralose). It tasted even better.</p>
<p>I did the same thing with miso from Berkeley. It was still very good.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine not drinking tea. But I can now imagine drinking less tea because miso is much healthier. Replacing tea with miso is an easy way to eat more fermented food. A cup of miso is easier to make than a cup of tea.</p>
<p>Incidentally, don&#8217;t waste your time with powdered miso. It is much worse than the refrigerated miso (paste) sold in tubs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A month ago I bought three identical tea pots <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/">to compare tea</a> side by side. I hoped to take advantage of<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/08/the-willat-effect-side-by-side-comparisons-create-connoisseurs/"> the Willat Effect</a> (side-by-side comparisons create connoisseurs) to become a tea connoisseur.</p>
<p>It worked. Side-by-side tea comparisons are fun, easy, and have taught me a lot. When I drink tea I notice more and like it more. I do about three comparisons per day. I blogged about the first results <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/24/even-more-about-the-willat-effect/">here</a>. The most useful idea about these comparisons came from Carl Willat himself: Compare the same tea brewed differently (e.g., different amounts of tea, different brewing times, different water temperatures). Most of my comparisons vary amount of tea or brewing time.</p>
<p>These many  comparisons have had several effects:<span id="more-4480"></span></p>
<p>1. Yeah, I&#8217;m a snob. No more cheap tea. Yeah, I&#8217;m more nerdy about it.</p>
<p>2. I bought a scale (<a href="http://www.camry.cn/products/Pocket-Scales-EHA901.htm">Camry EHA901</a>, $12 in America) with a precision of 0.01 gram. No more heaping teaspoons. Mostly I use 1.5 grams of tea with about 170 ml water. For dense tea, 1.5 grams is roughly 1 teaspoon. Standard-size teabags contain about 2 g of tea.</p>
<p>3. Much different brewing times than recommended. The black tea I have now is Ahmad Tea English Tea No. 1 (in spite of the name, not expensive). The tin says &#8220;infuse 4-6 minutes.&#8221; I used to brew it (and all black tea) 5 minutes, now I prefer less than 3 minutes. I found that 2.75 minutes is better than 3 minutes.  Around 3 minutes it starts getting bitter &#8212; I never noticed! Another example is  <a href="http://www.americantearoom.com/">American Tea Room</a>&#8216;s Choco Late, which contains cacao husks, vanilla, and rooibos. The package says brew 5 minutes. I prefer 30 minutes &#8212; 30 minutes tastes better than 20 minutes, I have found several times.</p>
<p>4. To make the comparisons as sensitive as possible I want to start with equal tea pots, so I need to clean them well after each use. This became boring. I could eliminate cleaning by using tea bags. I bought ordinary-size empty tea bags. Side-by-side comparisons (same tea, bagged versus loose) showed they made the flavor much worse. Too bad I&#8217;d bought 200. I bought much larger tea bags to use as liners rather than bags. That worked fine &#8212; no cleaning needed, taste just as good. However, they are too large, so I shorten them. The concept of a disposable tea liner (instead of tea bag) <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;tea+liner&quot;">seems to be new</a>. I cannot <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22disposable%20tea%20liner%22">find any for sale</a>. My connoisseurship has not only caused me to spend much more on tea, it has made me want an interesting new product. Tea pot makers could sell liners specially designed for their pots.  Continuing revenue, like razor blades.</p>
<p>5. I stopped adding artificial sweetener (e.g.,  Splenda) to black tea. Now I prefer it without sweetener.  I continue to add cream to black tea. This is the most surprising and intriguing change. Maybe sweetness is a distraction from the complexity of the flavor (which I now notice more and derive more pleasure from), but creaminess is not. I imagine the same thing is behind <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/10/please-do-not-buy-richard-stallman-a-parrot-and-other-rules/">Richard Stallman&#8217;s</a> &#8220;If it <em></em>is tea I really like, I like it without milk and sugar.&#8221; And maybe the same thing is behind all sorts of artistic expression that strike outsiders as harsh and unpleasant. A few years ago I went to a <a href="http://www.bam.org/">BAM</a> (Brooklyn Academy of Music) concert and was stunned how unpleasant it was. Yet the composer (who performed it) surely enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Regular readers know I think <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf">connoisseurship evolved because it increased technological innovation</a>. My experience so far supports this. Thanks to the Willat Effect, I am more of a connoisseur. As a result of this change, I am spending more on high-end artisanal goods (expensive tea) and precision manufacturing (precision scale)  and I want a new product (disposable tea liners).</p>
<p>People think of connoisseurs as having higher standards. The word <em>connoisseur</em> seems to mean exactly that.  Iin some obvious ways, they do. Yet the sweetener change (I no longer want sweetener) is in a way a <strong>lowering</strong> of standards. Sweetness is pleasant. I no longer require, or even want, my tea to be sweet. As far as I can tell, something like this is true throughout the arts. Connoisseurs make unusual demands, yes, but in some ways they are easier to please than non-connoisseurs. Indie films are less pleasant than mainstream films. Yet film connoisseurs like them more. To most people, indie films are also much cheaper and more experimental than mainstream films. By supporting them &#8212; by preferring them &#8212; film connoisseurs are supporting innovation. The connoisseurs have lowered their standards for film in the sense that they can enjoy cheaper films. A friend of mine attends the San Francisco International Film Festival  each year. He enjoys it. I wouldn&#8217;t. The SF film festival films don&#8217;t cost much, yet  they have a certain innovative quality. (I&#8221;m not a film connoisseur, I barely understand it.) The source of pleasure has shifted from conventional sources (plot, music, dialogue, gorgeous actors, sets, and landscapes) to something else, perhaps novelty and complexity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have had tea daily for the last ten years, ever since I discovered the Shangri-La Diet. A few weeks ago, I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/">started doing side-by-side comparisons of similar teas or the same tea prepared two ways</a> (e.g., different brewing times). Would <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/08/the-willat-effect-side-by-side-comparisons-create-connoisseurs/">the Willat Effect</a> make me a tea connoisseur?</p>
<p>Since then I have done at least one side-by-side comparison every day. It&#8217;s almost as easy as making an ordinary cup of tea and a lot more fun. These comparisons have taught me more about tea preparation than the previous ten years. I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<p>1. The black tea I have (an Earl-Grey variant) tastes better when brewed for 3.5 minutes than 4.0 minutes.</p>
<p>2. The black tea tastes better when I use 1.5 grams of tea than when I use 2.0 grams of tea. (After starting these comparisons, I bought <a href="http://www.camry.cn/products/Pocket-Scales-EHA901.htm">a scale for weighing tea</a>.)</p>
<p>3. One of the green teas I have tastes better when &#8220;rinsed&#8221; for 30 seconds before brewing 1 minute than when simply brewed for 1 minute. In China, this preference (rinse green tea before brewing) is common. I was reminded of it by <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/18/more-about-the-willat-effect/#comment-928868">this comment</a> and <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=2101">Paul Jaminet&#8217;s post about tea</a>. Black tea is different, as <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/18/more-about-the-willat-effect/">I noted earlier</a>.</p>
<p>4. I have a caffeine-free tea blend called <a href="http://www.americantearoom.com/choco-late-no-caffeine-tea.html">Choco Late</a> made of cacao husks, vanilla, and rooibos. The package says brew 5 minutes. Which is nonsense. It tastes better (fuller, more rounded) when brewed 30 minutes than when brewed 15 minutes. (I&#8217;ve noticed the same thing with caffeine-free chai blends. Enormous brewing times, like 60 minutes, produce much better results than short times.)</p>
<p>5. My most interesting discovery is when I brew Choco Late for 30 minutes it tastes so good I no longer want to sweeten it. It is pleasant enough already and sweetness would distract from the complexity, fullness, and slight bitterness. (At first I wrote &#8220;lovely complexity, fullness &#8230;&#8221;) I was shocked when I noticed this. It has never happened before.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tealula.com/blog/14/do-you-want-to-be-a-tea-connoisseur">This tea-selling website</a> mentions the Willat Effect under the heading &#8220;Do you want to be a tea connoisseur?&#8221; I hope this means the idea will spread among the fancy-food community. They have a lot to gain from better understanding of how to make people connoisseurs. Many times I have asked people in that community <em>what makes someone a connoisseur?</em> The usual answer is education. In my case, Willat-Effect comparisons (side-by-side comparisons of similar teas) were far more powerful than reading about tea, drinking a variety of teas, going on tea tours, going to ordinary tea tastings (where you taste a wide range of teas), and talking about tea with experts. I have been to five or six Fancy Food Shows and have visited thousands of booths. Exactly one booth offered side-by-side comparisons of similar products. It was their product made with and without a special ingredient.</p>
<p>Willat-Effect comparisons are mini-science. They aren&#8217;t quantitative but they include three other things central to science: 1. Close comparisons. This is the essence of experimentation. 2. You don&#8217;t know the answer. 3. You care about the answer.</p>
