They didn&#8217;t solve the problem. It would have been wiser to try to figure what in the environment might be causing the problem. It certainly wasn&#8217;t<em> not eating enough antibiotics</em>.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, <a href="http://bolenreport.com/feature_articles/ddvbarrett%20amend.pdf" target="_blank">Doctor&#8217;s Data, an Illinois clinical lab, sued Stephen Barrett</a>, who runs Quackwatch, for making false and misleading statements about them. The lawsuit is still in progress. I am glad they sued. As far as I can tell, Quackwatch does contain false and misleading statements.<span id="more-11956"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten about fifteen hair tests &#8212; whenever I get my hair cut &#8212; from Doctor&#8217;s Data. The test measures about forty elements, such as mercury, tin, and selenium. One test costs about $60. One reason I test my hair is curiosity – who knows what I might learn? Another is concern about heavy metal exposure due to living in Beijing. In <a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hair.html" target="_blank">a post updated in 2010</a>, Barrett called hair tests &#8220;a cardinal sign of quackery&#8221;. I have no idea whether there is any truth to Barrett&#8217;s argument but I am sure he is too confident I am wasting my money. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/26/damage-due-to-mercury-revealed-by-brain-test/" target="_blank">My own data</a> suggest Barrett is wrong about the safety of mercury amalgam fillings. He believes that all safety concerns about those fillings are wrong. I found that when I had some of mine removed, my brain test scores improved starting exactly at the time of removal. We live in a world where all doctors &#8212; conventional and alternative &#8212; know almost nothing about the cause of almost any major health problem (heart disease, depression, obesity, and so on). Barrett shows no sign of understanding this. He is too sure that people who disagree with him are wrong.</p>
<p>Doctor&#8217;s Data is far from perfect. Their hair tests have three serious weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The information they provide customers like me comes without any information that would allow me to judge the error of measurement. I had to send in two samples from the same haircut to get some idea.</p>
<p>2. The measurements they give come with comparisons to  a group of supposedly normal people (“reference range”) but those people are not described, making it hard or impossible to interpret these comparisons.</p>
<p>3. They do not report calibration results. I would like to make comparisons across tests &#8212; e.g., from a test done this month to a test done six months ago. However, I have no idea about the stability of their equipment.</p>
<p>Many clinical labs have these problems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the information their hair test provides is far from worthless, as far as I can tell. It is hard to learn anything from one test due to the problems I mention (e.g., if a value is high it might be measurement error) but repeated testing is more interesting. If a value suddenly gets worse for several tests, that suggests a problem. <em>A</em><em>ny</em> pattern in your results might tell you something useful.</p>
<p>If Doctor&#8217;s Data hair tests <em>are</em> worthless, this would be easy to show. Get two samples of hair (at the same time) from each of ten people. Get all 20 samples tested. If there is no correlation between the two samples, the test is probably worthless. No one, including Barrett, has provided such evidence.</p>
<p>You can learn details of the lawsuit, which Tim Bolen is sure Barrett will lose, from <a href="http://www.bolenreport.com/feature_articles/Doctor's-Data-v-Barrett/Foison%20fluff.htm" target="_blank">Bolen&#8217;s website</a>. I have enjoyed reading about it &#8212; for example, <a href="http://bolenreport.com/feature_articles/Doctor%27s-Data-v-Barrett/may%20discovery%20fight.pdf" target="_blank">this complaint</a> about Barrett&#8217;s lawyer&#8217;s time-consuming method of discovery. Every story needs a villain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=64350">Here</a> is an excellent introduction to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression, centering on a Stanford psychiatrist named David Burns. I was especially interested in this:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Burns] currently draws from at least 15 schools of therapy, calling his methodology TEAM—for testing, empathy, agenda setting and methods. . . . Testing means requiring that patients complete a short mood survey before and after each therapy session. In Chicago, Burns asks how many of the therapists [in the audience] do this. Only three [out of 100] raise their hands. Then how can they know if their patients are making progress? Burns asks. How would they feel if their own doctors didn&#8217;t take their blood pressure during each check-up?</p>
<p>Burns says that in the 1970s at Penn [where he learned about CBT], &#8220;They didn&#8217;t measure because there was no expectation that there would be a significant change in a single session or even over a course of months.&#8221; Forty years later, it&#8217;s shocking that so little attention is paid to measuring whether therapy makes a difference. . . &#8221;Therapists falsely believe that their impression or gut instinct about what the patient is feeling is accurate,&#8221; says May [a Stanford-educated Bay Area psychiatrist], when in fact their accuracy is very low.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I was a graduate student, I started measuring my acne. One day I told my dermatologist what I&#8217;d found. &#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221; he asked. He really didn&#8217;t know. Many years later, an influential psychiatrist &#8212; Burns, whose <em>Feeling Good</em> book, a popularization of CBT, has sold millions of copies &#8212; tells therapists to give patients a mood survey. That&#8217;s progress.</p>
<p>But it is also a testament to the backward thinking of doctors and therapists that Burns didn&#8217;t tell his audience:</p>
<p>&#8211;have patients fill out a mood survey every day<br />
&#8211;graph the results</p>
<p>Even more advanced:</p>
<p>&#8211;use the mood scores to measure the effects of different treatments</p>
<p>Three cheap safe things. It is obvious they would help patients. Apparently Burns doesn&#8217;t do these things with his own patients, even though his own therapy (TEAM) stresses &#8220;testing&#8221; and &#8220;methods&#8221;. It&#8217;s 2013. Not only do psychiatrists and therapists not do these things, <strong>they don&#8217;t even think of doing them</strong>. I seem to be the first to suggest them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many years I have used the services of <a href="http://www.westcoasthealthservices.com/cm/Home.html" target="_blank">Heart Watch</a> to measure my cholesterol and other health-related things, such as HbA1c. The couple that runs Heart Watch, Sandy and Glen, travels up and down California. I was able to get tested only every three months. Feeling that this was inadequate, just as I did, a man named Karl Corbett recently started a business called <a href="http://myheartwatch.com/" target="_blank">My Heart Watch</a> that allows much more frequent tests in the Bay Area, at similar price. My Heart Watch uses the same portable testing devices as Heart Watch.</p>
<p>The Berkeley location is almost across the street from Whole Foods. I signed up online (I was the first person to use their online sign-up service), which was very convenient. </p>
<p>Corbett told me that he greatly improved his cholesterol numbers by changing to <a href="http://www.heartattackproof.com/" target="_blank">a Caldwell-Esselstyn &#8220;plant-based diet&#8221;</a> that included lots of vegetables, some fruit, no oils, and no animal-based products. (Since the usual oils, such olive and soybean oil, are plant-based, this is a curious feature. Esselstyn seems to ignore <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2144195" target="_blank">bad effects of cholesterol lowering</a>.) The more often you can test yourself, the more easily you can determine what controls what you&#8217;re measuring. When you can test yourself often enough to be sure whether a dietary (or other) change has made a difference, you can begin to ignore large clinical trials and their many limitations, which include poor choice of control group, poor statistics, incomplete reporting, biassed reporting, publication bias, confoundings, investigator fraud, on and on. They are the fool&#8217;s-gold standard. If I can determine if <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/02/does-alternate-day-fasting-lower-hba1c/" target="_blank">alternate-day fasting improves my HbA1c</a>, I can ignore what clinical trials say about it.</p>
<p>Before writing this post I spoke to Corbett about getting discounted testing in return for publicizing My Heart Watch. </p>

I have only learned from tracking when I am adventurous &#8212; when I change stuff, such as what I eat. I will be curious to see if the same thing happens here. The initial thought when tracking yourself is &#8220;keep things constant&#8221; so that the data from different days will be more comparable. This makes sense if you are doing an experiment where different days get different treatments. It does not make sense when you are not doing an experiment. This self-tracker doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing any experiments, so he should allow his life to be messy if he wants to learn more.</span></li>

This is an example of the way economists usually ignore innovation, which benefits from new ideas and skills. Innovations usually derive from new combinations of things. To open a new business (an instance of economic freedom) it really helps to have a new good or service. New cuisines (immigrants open restaurants) is just the beginning.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/work_done_vs_date.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10488" alt="work_done_vs_date" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/work_done_vs_date-573x300.jpg" width="573" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This graph shows how much work I did in early 2013 (one point = one day). It gradually rose from about 2 hours/day to about 8 hours/day. I did not literally get to 8 hours/day because some tasks got counted extra. For example, one minute of Chinese counted as 2 minutes and one minute of book writing counted as 1.5 minutes. <span style="font-size: 13px;">The data is in three blocks because sometimes I didn&#8217;t use the tracking program (e.g., due to travel). </span><br />
<span id="more-10454"></span></p>
<p>I gathered the data with a program that gave <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/05/01/percentile-feedback-and-productivity/" target="_blank"><em>percentile feedback</em></a>. Percentile feedback compares where you are now (measured in various ways, such as time of day, e.g., 3 pm) to where you were at the same time on previous days and summarizes the comparison with a percentile: 75 means more work done than on 75% of previous days at the same time; 50 means more work done than on 50% of previous days at the same time. Displays of such feedback, I noted <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/05/01/percentile-feedback-and-productivity/" target="_blank">earlier</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>are curiously likable. They usually praised me, in the sense that the percentile score was usually well above 50. . . . They are calm, in the sense that they do not change quickly. . . . Every improvement was noticed and rewarded — and every non-improvement was also gently noted. It was as if the display <strong>cared</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nick Winter <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/28/nick-winters-big-success-with-percentile-feedback/" target="_blank">used</a> with an earlier version of percentile feedback (<a href="http://vimeo.com/36503801" target="_blank">video</a>). &#8220;The percentile feedback has been a huge success,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I’m getting way more done than I ever did, and I’m much better at prioritizing toward my main project.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new version has several improvements. The biggest change is weights &#8212; different tasks may have different weights. Tasks that are more valuable or more difficult get more weight. If you keep failing to do something important, you increase its weight, making it more attractive. For a long time, I have had trouble making myself study Chinese. This has helped a lot.</p>
<p>It has also pushed me away from blogging (less valuable) toward book writing (more valuable). I am writing a book about personal science. The chapter I am writing now is about procrastination.</p>
<p>This program has been a big help with procrastination and has improved my use of time in other ways. To get material for the procrastination chapter, I am making the program (written in R) available, along with a draft of the procrastination chapter. I want to find out what happens when other people use it.</p>
<p>To get the program and use it, you need to install <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> (which runs under Windows, MacOS, and many UNIX platforms), use Dropbox, and use PayPal. You can do some work away from the computer but it won&#8217;t work unless you do most of your work at or near the computer.</p>
<p>For better or worse I have learned it is a waste of time to give software to others for free. If you are interested in using it, please send me an email with the following information:</p>
<p>1. Your job.</p>
<p>2. Why you want to try this.</p>
<p>3. How much you will pay (non-refundable after 2 days).</p>
<p>4. How long you will commit to using it.</p>
<p>5. How much you will pay if you don&#8217;t meet the commitment (= a refundable amount).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll pick the highest bidders. If you&#8217;re one of them, you&#8217;ll give me the amount in #3 plus the amount in #5 via PayPal. I&#8217;ll install the program on your computer via Dropbox and show you how to use it (in addition to the written instructions). If you use it for the promised length of time, I&#8217;ll refund the amount in #5.<span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>

<p>Around 60% of the population has low Vitamin D.[What's low Vitamin D?] As of today, if you look at the ranges of the diagnostic companies, they are saying that everything below 30 ng/ml is low Vitamin D. We are giving you your optimal zone based on age, gender, athletic activity and ethnicity. We also compare you to your peers.<span id="more-9966"></span></p>
<p><strong>What else?</strong></p>
<p>More than 50% have high cholesterol (total and LDL). With folic acid, about 40% of the population have high folic acid. This is because of supplementation.</p>
<p>High creatine kinase (CK) is another common problem. When you exercise, some of the muscle cells break down and this protein leaks into the blood. An example is a marathon runner. Before the marathon it’s below 200 U/L. After the run it can be as high as 10,000 U/L. If you over exercise the level might be above 1000, and you have a much higher chance of getting injured. A bit more than 30% of our customers have high CK. It has a half life of 5 days. Your steady state CK should be less than 1000. Some supplementation can lower it, such CoQ10 and others.</p>
<p>Another marker we measure is hemoglobin. It measures the amount of iron in your blood cells. If you have low hemoglobin you compromise your athletic ability and decision making. About 30% of our customers have low hemoglobin. Another marker related to Iron is ferritin (protein that binds to free Iron), If you have low ferritin, take iron supplementation or eat iron rich food, that will increase both ferritin and hemoglobin. If you have normal ferritin and low hemoglobin, there are limited interventions to help you increase your hemoglobin, you may need to go to a high altitude place. Women below 50 tend to have low ferritin. The percentage is 10% among non-athletes, jumping to 30% among athletes. We also find it in athletic males. When you exercise, you have microbleeding from your gut. Among male athletes, 10-12% have low ferritin. The major concern is that they don’t know this.</p>
<p><strong>What have you learned about how to increase Vitamin D?</strong></p>
<p>When we started, we looked at the literature, it said you should take 400-800 IU/day. We found that even if you just take 1000 IU/day you will just maintain the level you already have. To increase it you need to consume at least 2000 IU/day. I started by testing myself. I found I had pretty low Vitamin D. At first I tried just food &#8212; fatty fish and mushrooms. I ate fish twice/day and a lot of mushrooms for a couple of months. Then I measured it again. It hadn’t changed. Then I took 1000 IU/day. I tested my blood again and it still hadn’t gone up. Then I went to 4000 IU/day and this brought me to the optimal level. And we saw the same with some of our customers.</p>
<p>Testosterone is a very interesting hormone. It’s hard to measure. When you overexercise, it&#8217;s low, because of the stress. It’s strongly influenced by amount of sleep, if you don’t sleep well, it will go down. We found if you look at the average consumer, around 10% have low testosterone, and none of them knew it. It’s an expensive test. Insurance companies won’t pay for it unless there is a reason.[What's low testosterone?] The adult male: below 348 ng/dl. Women have about 20 times less testosterone. Only a tiny percentage of women, about 1%, have low testosterone.</p>
