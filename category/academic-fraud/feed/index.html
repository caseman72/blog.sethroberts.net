<li><a href="http://anothersb.blogspot.com/2014/04/dear-academia-i-loved-you-but-im.html" target="_blank">Postdoc leaves academia</a> (fMRI emotion research). &#8220;I actually ran into that process in three different labs, two of which were at TopUniversityA with PIs who I highly revered and respected. It&#8217;s just how it goes in those fields&#8230;remove all of the negative results, don&#8217;t actually report the ridiculous number of fishing expeditions you went on (especially in fMRI research), make it sound like you mostly knew what you were going to find in the first place, make it a nice clean story. When my colleagues (from a well-known, well-respected emotion research lab) were trying to talk me into removing all of the negative results and altering what my original hypothesis was, literally saying &#8220;everyone does it&#8230;&#8221; that was it for me. I had a sinking feeling that everyone did do it that way and that I couldn&#8217;t trust the majority of work I had to depend on/reference myself. The level of denial in psychology and human neuroimaging research that this process just clogs the system with useless BS is something I just can&#8217;t stomach.&#8221; Devastating criticism &#8212; especially finding the same thing in three different labs. I believe nothing involving fMRI and psychology. My friend Hal Pashler <a href="http://www.pashler.com/Articles/Vul_etal_2008inpress.pdf" target="_blank">wrote about this</a>. At UC Berkeley, the fMRI machine used by psychology researchers malfunctioned for years. Nobody noticed. Only when someone from UC Davis got different results at Berkeley was the problem detected.</li>

<li>A very common knee surgery ($14 billion per year spent on it in America) <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1305189" target="_blank">turns out to be no better than sham surgery</a> in many cases. Plainly this supports critics of medicine who say there is overtreatment. To be fair there is good news: 1. At least this particular operation wasn&#8217;t <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html" target="_blank">contraindicated by high school biology</a>.  2. The study was done and published. 3. And publicized widely enough to influence practice.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2013/07/31/european-heart-guidelines-based-on-disgraced-research-may-have-caused-thousands-of-deaths/" target="_blank">Heart guidelines based on fake research probably killed tens of thousands of people</a>. Making useless knee surgery look good.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.booktv.org/Watch/15088/Chasing+Chaos+My+Decade+In+and+Out+of+Humanitarian+Aid.aspx" target="_blank">&#8220;The time you&#8217;re taking to help this girl, you could be &#8230;&#8221;</a> A great talk by Jessica Alexander about ten years working for NGOs. Her book is <em>Chasing Chaos: My Decade In and Out of Humanitarian Aid</em>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/12/judith_curry_on.html" target="_blank">On EconTalk</a>, Judith Curry, the climatologist, makes the excellent point that it is weird to call someone who believes climate questions are more complex than portrayed a &#8220;denier&#8221;. In every other use of the term, a denier is someone who <em>avoids</em> recognizing complexity, i.e., the opposite. On the other side of the ledger, Curry makes an elementary physics mistake when she says that as an ice cube floating in your drink melts, the water level of your drink rises. (It stays the same.)</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=">google &#8220;Ranjit Chandra&#8221;</a> (a famous Canadian nutrition researcher), the second result is <a href="http://sethroberts.net/chandra/">this page</a>, created by me, which lists many articles about a scandal that Saul Sternberg and I did a lot to to uncover. We pointed out that several details of one of Chandra&#8217;s papers were impossible. I did not create the page to harm Chandra, but it does: For the rest of his life, anyone curious about him will find out about the scandal. It is a scarlet letter with capital S and capital L.</p>
<p>I suspect this is why Leiden University recently <a href="http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/leiden-university-fires-employee-for-research-fraud-two-retractions-to-follow/" target="_blank">fired a scientist without naming him/her</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) has fired an employee who has committed fraud in the collection of research data. An internal inquiry showed that the employee deliberately manipulated laboratory research. The employee has confessed and accepted the dismissal. Additionally, the LUMC withdraws two scientific publications by this employee. The fraud was discovered by immediate colleagues at the Rheumatology Department.</p></blockquote>
<p>A deal was struck. The employee won&#8217;t contest the firing, the medical center won&#8217;t name the employee in the press release. The employee didn&#8217;t want the scandal to follow him/her for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>I disagree with this deal. As a result of the employee&#8217;s fabrication, a clinical trial was started in which <strong>sick people ingested or had injected a powerful drug</strong>. The university claims no one was hurt (&#8220;It is clear that at no time a dangerous situation has arisen for patients&#8221;). I have no idea if anyone was hurt, but the potential for damage was great. Last night a friend told me about a Traditional Chinese Medicine drug that a friend of hers took. It worked for years and then one day stopped working. It came from China. It turned out the Chinese manufacturer had run out of the crucial ingredient and had substituted an animal tranquilizer. Her friend was really damaged by this. Chandra&#8217;s data might have caused people to take too many <em>vitamins</em>.</p>
<p>The medical center employees who handled this case (presumably very high up in medical center administration) treated the rest of us &#8212; who deserve to be warned about the fabricator &#8212; not so differently than the fabricator did: as people who don&#8217;t matter. Who don&#8217;t deserve protection.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> <a href="http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/leiden-university-fires-employee-for-research-fraud-two-retractions-to-follow/#comment-61712" target="_blank">A comment at Retraction Watch</a> says the anonymity is Dutch tradition: &#8220;The names of the people are not published so that these people have a chance of rebuilding their lives in the future. In the Netherlands even people who have committed serious crimes do not have their full name or photo published in the press.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In response to allegations that Terry Deacon, a Berkeley professor, plagiarized from Alicia Juarrero, a professor at <a href="http://www.pgcc.edu/" target="_blank">a community college</a>, UC Berkeley created <a href="http://terrydeacon.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">a website</a> that (among other things) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/02/03/new-terry-deacon-website/" target="_blank">tried to smear Michael Lissack</a>, one of the accusers. Less obvious is that the committee that investigated the allegations ignored their core: The overlap with Juarrero is relentless. It goes on and on. Juarrero explained this to me when I asked her what she thought of <a href="http://terrydeacon.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/docs/deacon.report.pdf" target="_blank">the committee report</a>:</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m disappointed, but not surprised. Not sure what the difference is between &#8220;reckless&#8221; (which their definition of plagiarism includes) and &#8220;negligent&#8221; (which they critiqued as a &#8220;novel interpretation&#8221; of plagiarism). I&#8217;ll tell you how my <em>cri de coeur</em> spreadsheet came about: as I read Deacon [<em>Incomplete Nature</em>] I got angrier and angrier, so I decided to start the spreadsheet. The index in my own book [<em>Dynamics in Action</em>] is very bad (my fault, my inexperience) and so I was having a hard time finding the parallel material in my own work. I knew I had said something to that effect somewhere in the book but couldn&#8217;t remember where and couldn&#8217;t find the entry in my own index. But suddenly, a pattern emerged: All I had to do was read on a few pages or paragraphs further down from the previous &#8220;problem,&#8221; and there would be the next item. This happened over and over again in huge chunks of the work (which I highlighted to point out the big chunks of seriatim similarities) &#8212; it&#8217;s the seriatimness (!) that&#8217;s so damning and to me, clear evidence this wasn&#8217;t just someone who vaguely remembered what I had said in a talk and then reconstructed the ideas for himself. The sheer number and sequential nature of the similarities are just too improbable to be a coincidence, or two people working in the same field. He was quite clever about it. He hid it with neologisms, talking about whole-part instead of top-down causality, insisting that self-organization is not enough (and then turning around in advocating it), etc. And, of course, not discussing intentional action, which is the explicit subject of my book.<span id="more-9241"></span></p>
<p>The spreadsheet for <em>Dynamics in Action</em> and <em>Incomplete Nature</em> is on my website, <a href="http://www.aliciajuarrero.com" target="_blank">www.aliciajuarrero.com</a>. It was the seriatim nature of the parallels that really got to me and made me complain to Norton and UC Berkeley &#8212; anyone can discuss two or three of the same authors; or two or three of the same themes, or use two or three of the same examples; but that many, in pretty much the same order? The examples UCB picks (Benard cells, whirlpools) are indeed standard ones and if these were the only ones there would be no case. It&#8217;s the cumulative impact that makes the case, in my opinion. The comments that I really object to in the report are &#8220;The idea that it is possible to reconceptualize teleology in terms of dynamical systems theory has been discussed and developed by many theorists&#8221; and &#8220;The connection between ideas about self-organization and ideas from thermodynamics and information theory has been made by many writers in this area&#8230;&#8221; The UCB report should have cited sources and dates. Simply to state, &#8220;is not in our view original to Juarrero&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;we see no evidence that Deacon&#8217;s use&#8230; shows any influence of Juarrero&#8217;s&#8221; simply begs the question.</p>
<p>Re the Kant &amp; Self-organization piece: it&#8217;s true that everyone seems to be mentioning Kant in this connection (as if folks commonly read the Third Critique where Kant discusses this stuff). I suspect Deacon got this reference from his buddy Stu Kauffman (I would bet the rent Deacon didn&#8217;t read the Third Critique!) &#8212; but at least Kauffman included me in his bibliography, if not in the footnotes. But I don&#8217;t think Deacon could have afforded to include DiA in the bibliography &#8212; there&#8217;s just too much of <em>Dynamics in Action</em> in <em>Incomplete Nature</em> &#8211; he just hoped no one would catch the parallels with a community college professor who published 10 years ago. As a philosopher I probably would never have read <em>Incomplete Nature</em> &#8212; but then I saw the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> review and the ideas sounded awfully familiar&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to put the two works side by side and let readers judge for themselves.</p>
<p><em>How did Michael Lissack get involved?</em></p>
<p>First contact I had with him was in 2000, when he phoned my house to ask, &#8220;Is the phone ringing off the hook because of the book?&#8221; My answer: No, it isn&#8217;t, who are you? He invited me to give a talk at his ISCE <span style="font-size: 13px;">[Institute for the Study of Coherence and Emergence] </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">institute in Boston that year, and then invited me to be on the ISCE board. He also became a one-man publicity campaign for </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">Dynamics in Action</em><span style="font-size: 13px;">, including a long discussion about it with Kauffman, Deacon and Evan Thompson at Esalen in 2003. They spent hours discussing it. Which reminds me: Evan Thompson published a review in </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">Nature</em><span style="font-size: 13px;"> in December 2011 in which he explicitly states that Deacon failed to cite him &#8212; and me. And Colin McGinn (whom I&#8217;ve never met), really lit into Deacon in the </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">New York Review of Books</em><span style="font-size: 13px;"> in June 2012. None of this was mentioned in the UCB report, which makes it appear that Deacon&#8217;s just the victim of a witch hunt by Lissack, Rubino and me.</span></p>
<p>ISCE was the publisher for the Rubino-Juarrero anthology on Emergence that&#8217;s in question with the Deacon-Cashman article, so I think Michael feels ISCE organization is indirectly compromised by this mess &#8212; but it&#8217;s mostly that he has never seen a fight he&#8217;s run away from.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terry Deacon is a professor of anthropology at UC Berkeley. I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/09/12/the-terry-deacon-affair/" target="_blank">have blogged</a> about the accusation of plagiarism  (using Alicia Juarrero&#8217;s ideas without citing her) against him. In addition to <a href="http://theterrydeaconaffair.com/" target="_blank">the website</a> accusing him of plagiarism, there is now <a href="http://terrydeacon.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">a website</a> at berkeley.edu (UC Berkeley) meant to restore his reputation. It contains the report of a UC Berkeley committee that concluded there was not enough evidence to be sure Deacon had gotten certain ideas from Juarerro, whom he had heard talk about them. Except in one instance, they could also not conclude the opposite &#8212; that he did <em>not</em> get certain ideas from Juarrero. There wasn&#8217;t enough evidence to be sure of that, either.</p>
<p>The new website attempts to discredit Michael Lissack, one of Deacon&#8217;s accusers. Here, in its entirety, is how the website describes Lissack:</p>
<p><span id="more-9151"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Michael Lissack was formerly a managing director of a Wall Street municipal bond department. In 1998, the SEC issued an order finding that “Lissack willfully violated” federal securities laws and “that he undertook such conduct with an intent to deceive.” According to the New York Times, later that year, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office charged Lissack “with using the Internet to harass executives at his old firm.” Media reports indicated that Lissack subsequently pled guilty to second-degree harassment. Lissack’s web site identifies him as the founder and executive director of the Institute for the Study of Coherence and Emergence (ISCE), as well as “the ISCE Professor of Meaning in Organizations, and a serial entrepreneur.” His posted CV states that he received a BA from Williams College, an MBA from Yale School of Management, and a Doctorate of Business Administration from Henley Management College.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, maybe that&#8217;s relevant. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lissack" target="_blank">what&#8217;s also true</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Michael Lissack] is notable as the whistleblower who exposed a yield burning scandal in the 1990s, whereby financial firms made illegal profits from the structuring of U.S. Government investment portfolios associated with municipal bonds. . . . In 1994 Lissack exposed a major yield burning scandal on Wall Street. The issue was eventually settled by a number of firms for over $200 million,  to which Lissack was entitled to at least 15% per federal whistleblower laws. Lissack used some of these funds for charitable purposes including endowing a professorship in Social Responsibility and Personal Ethics at his alma mater Williams College.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked Lissack for comment on the committee report. He said, &#8220;By publishing the report the way they did and building a permanent web site they have ensured that anyone who attempts to treat Deacon seriously will read Juarrero and that was in many respects the goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>My expertise is too far from Juarrero&#8217;s and Deacon&#8217;s work for me to judge if the many similarities might be a coincidence, as Deacon claims. <em>[Update: Juarrero has explained the reason for alleging plagiarism to me and I now agree, the similarities are no coincidence. I will post about this again.]</em> I am sure, however, that Juarrero was right to be very upset that her work wasn&#8217;t cited.</p>
<p>I know the feeling. When I was a graduate student, at Brown University, I did several experiments with rats on the cross-modal transfer of time discrimination &#8212; the first such experiments in animals. They showed that rats had something like a concept of time. After I left graduate school and became a professor, my graduate school advisor, <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/CLPS/people/russell-church">Russell Church</a>, and a new graduate student, <a href="http://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people?Gurl=/aas/pn&amp;Uil=meck&amp;subpage=profile" target="_blank">Warren Meck</a>, essentially copied one of my experiments and the underlying theoretical idea. Needless to say it was not a case of independent invention. I had told Church about my experiments, which were done in his lab. I <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1982-20404-001" target="_blank">published my results</a> before they <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1983-04976-001" target="_blank">published theirs</a>. In spite of this,  Meck and Church gave me as little credit as possible consistent with citing my work. Their introduction doesn&#8217;t mention my work &#8212; as if they had thought of their experiments without my help.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I happened to be in Church&#8217;s office, visiting him, when the issue of the journal containing the Meck and Church paper arrived. I took the journal out of its brown paper cover. I looked at the table of contents. I saw their article, which I had not known about. (I wonder why.) I started to read it. I saw that, in the introduction, it didn&#8217;t mention my work. &#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221; I angrily asked Church. <em>To get more credit</em>, he said.</p>
<p>In my experience of academia, powerful people often take credit for what less powerful people have done. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/science/notebooks-shed-light-on-an-antibiotic-discovery-and-a-mentors-betrayal.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">The discovery of streptomycin</a>, for which the powerful person received a Nobel Prize and the less powerful person did not, is an example. In the Terry Deacon case, Lissack has helped outsiders decide who deserves credit for what.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The panel that chose the winners of the first John Maddox Prize &#8212; Colin Blakemore, a British psychologist, Tracey Brown (Sense About Science), Phil Campbell (<em>Nature</em>), and Brenda Maddox &#8212; deserve a prize for Most Contentious Award. <a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/john-maddox-prize.html" target="_blank">The Maddox Prize</a> is supposed to be awarded to people who have excelled at:</p>
<blockquote><p>any kind of public activity, including all forms of writing, speaking and public engagement, in any of the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addressing misleading information about scientific or medical issues in any forum.</li>
<li>Bringing sound evidence to bear in a public or policy debate.</li>
<li>Helping people to make sense of a complex scientific issue.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The first winners, announced in November, were Simon Wessely, a British psychiatrist, and Fang Shi-min, a Chinese journalist. Criticism of Fang is <a href="http://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-460310-632468.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Criticism of Wessely is <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/john-maddox-prize-1.11750" target="_blank">here</a> (in the comments) and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/me-bitterest-row-yet-in-a-long-saga-8348389.html" target="_blank">here</a>. One of his papers is <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/32109159/Wessely.MedicallyUnexplainedSymptoms.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Wessely is best known for promoting the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). In particular, &#8220;he and his colleagues demonstrated substantial overlap in symptoms between chronic fatigue syndrome and clinical depression. . . . He subsequently developed a treatment approach using cognitive-behavioural therapy techniques, which in many cases brought about substantial improvement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puzzle is that this is considered significant. Maybe people with CFS are depressed because they have CFS? Maybe this is why CBT helps them? <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/john-maddox-prize-1.11750" target="_blank">A statement explaining the reward</a> does not answer this objection. As for Fang, I have no idea if he deserves the prize. I would be surprised if members of the prize committee could judge for themselves the accuracy and value of his work.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3YB59EKMKw" target="_blank">David Healy talk</a> about problems with evidence-based medicine. Example of Simpson&#8217;s paradox in suicide rates.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201212/dsm-5-is-guide-not-bible-ignore-its-ten-worst-changes" target="_blank">The ten worst mistakes of DSM-5</a>. This is miserably argued. The author has two sorts of criticisms: 1. Narrow a diagnosis (e.g., autism): People who need treatment won&#8217;t get it! 2. Widen a diagnosis (e.g., depression) or add a new one (many examples): This will cause fads and over-medication! It isn&#8217;t clear how to balance the two goals (helping people get treatment, avoiding fads and over-medication) nor why the various changes being criticized will produce more bad than good. Allen Frances, the author, was chair of the committee in charge of DSM-4. He could have written: &#8220;When we wrote DSM-4, we made several mistakes . . . . The committee behind DSM-5 has not learned from our mistakes. . . .&#8221; That would have been more convincing. That the chair of the committee behind DSM-4, in spite of feeling strongly about it, cannot persuasively criticize DSM-5 speaks volumes.</li>

This is perhaps the main finding of the three Dutch academic committees which investigated his fraud. The committees found many bad practices: researchers who keep rerunning an experiment until they get the right result, who omit inconvenient data, misunderstand statistics, don’t share their data, and so on.&#8221;</li>
