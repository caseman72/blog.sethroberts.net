					<p>I showed a Chinese friend of mine the famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTSQozWP-rM">Chinese Professor commercial</a>. In Beijing, 2030, a Chinese professor tells his students about the fallen American empire. It is a commercial against &#8220;government waste&#8221;.</p>
<p>My friend said that in China you would be put in jail for making such a commercial. There is lots of waste in the Chinese government, she said. I asked her for examples. One is restaurant meals. Government officials go out for extremely expensive meals and eat just a few bites. I have heard that one quarter of restaurant spending in China comes from the government. There is a restaurant near my apartment with absurdly high prices; one of my students said that only government officials would eat there. Another example of government waste is cars. Government officials have big expensive cars.</p>

					<p>A Chinese friend of mine said that if you are at a high level in the Chinese government, you have a great deal of freedom. Below that level, however, you have very little freedom: You spend all your time doing exactly what your bosses want. <em>And you have no idea how long the slavery will last</em>. American government is different, she said. High American officials have less freedom than those outside government. I agree.</p>
<p>My friend disliked Obama because he constantly spoke about big ideals (&#8220;liberty&#8221; and so on) that my friend thought were very difficult to achieve. In other words, he constantly made promises that he was not going to be able to keep. She noted Obama&#8217;s inexperience and said that people in other areas of government are very smart and would outmaneuver him. (Exhibit 1: Goldman Sachs.) This doesn&#8217;t happen in the Chinese government because the people at the top are very old and have come up through the ranks, all the way from the bottom. Because of that long experience, they better understand how to get the rest of the government to do what they want.</p>
<p>In China, rich people fear the government. They must do what the government wants or they will be squashed. In America, she said, rich people do not fear the government. If anything, they tell the government what to do. <a href="http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/">I agree</a>. Many people, such as Hayek and Milton Friedman, want less government. But I have yet to hear one of them answer the point that if government becomes too weak, rich people will control it.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>At Tsinghua University, there is a great range of wealth amongÂ  students. Some are from very rich families, some from very poor. I asked a friend how to distinguish rich students and poor ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the student store, rich students buy things that cost more than 15 yuan [2 dollars],&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>I asked another student the same question.</p>
<p>&#8220;By their shoes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;especially sports shoes.&#8221;Â  Poor students wear Chinese brands you&#8217;ve never heard of. Rich students wear American brands.</p>
<p>Like my friend&#8217;s answer, this surprised me. At <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/01/10/beijing-shopping-clothes-at-beijing-zoo/">the Beijing Zoo</a>, I paid $10 for Nike shoes that cost $100 in America. Yet when visiting America, Chinese people I know have bought Nike shoes, because genuine Nike cost less in America than in China. So the American shoes of the rich students are probably genuine (> $100) and the Chinese-brand shoes of the poor students cost less than $10 ($5?).</p>

				<small>Wednesday, December 15th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A few weeks ago I got a treadmill for my Beijing apartment. Two days ago I was walking on it (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/">I try to walk 1 hr/day</a>) while watching <em>Leverage</em> to make the activity more palatable. But <span style="font-style: italic">Leverage </span>bored me. It was too simple. So I took out some Chinese flashcards (character on one side, English and pinyin on the other) and started studying them. I was <span style="font-weight: bold">astonished</span> how pleasant it was. An hour of walking and studying went by . . . uh, in a flash. In my entire life I have never had such a pleasant hour studying. The next day it happened again! The experience appears infinitely repeatable. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/05/08/more-about-treadmills-and-learning/">previously</a> mentioned <a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2010/05/paradise_learnt.html">the man who memorized <em>Paradise Lost</em> while walking on a treadmill</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed before that <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/02/23/boring-boring-pleasant/">treadmill walking (by itself boring) and Chinese-character learning (by itself boring) become pleasant when combined</a>. So why was I astonished? Because the increase in enjoyment was larger. The whole activity was really pleasant, like drinking water when thirsty. When an hour was up, I could have kept going. I wanted to do it again. When I noticed it earlier, I was using Anki to learn Chinese characters. Now I am using flashcards in blocks of ten (study 10 until learned, get a new set of 10, study them until learned . . . ). The flashcards provide much more sense of accomplishment and completion, which I thinks makes the activity more pleasant.</p>
<p>My progress with Chinese characters has been so slow that during the latest attempt (putting them on my wall) I didn&#8217;t even try to learn both the pinyin and the meaning at the same time; I had retreated to just trying to learn the meaning. That was hard enough. I have had about 100 character cards on the walls of my apartment for a month but I&#8217;ve only learned the meaning of about half of them. No pinyin at all. In contrast, in two one-hour treadmill sessions I&#8217;ve gotten through 60 cardsÂ  . . . <em>including pinyin</em>. For me, learning pinyin is much harder than learning meaning.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like drinking water when you&#8217;re thirsty versus when you&#8217;re not thirsty. The walking turns a kind of switch that makes it pleasant to learn dry knowledge, just as lack of water creates thirst. Not only did studying dry materials become much more pleasant I suspect I also became more efficient &#8212; more retentive. I was surprised how fast I managed to reach a criterion of zero mistakes.</p>
<p>I had previously studied flashcards while walking around Tsinghua. This did not produce an <em>oh-my-god</em> experience. I can think of three reasons why the effect is now much stronger: 1. Ordinary walking is distracting. You have to watch where you&#8217;re going, there are other people, cars, trees, and so on. Distraction reduces learning. If the distractions are boring &#8212; and they usually are &#8211;Â  the experience becomes less pleasant. 2. Ordinary walking provides more information than treadmill walking (which provides no information at all &#8212; you&#8217;re staring at a wall). The non-flashcard info reduces desire to learn what&#8217;s on the flashcards. 3. On these Tsinghua walks I had about 100 flashcards which I cycled through. Using sets of 10, as I said, provides more sense of accomplishment. I&#8217;ve also had about 20 Chinese-speaking lessons while walking around. The walking made the lessons more pleasant, yes, but it wasn&#8217;t nearly as enjoyable as the treadmill/flashcard combination. And because lessons with a tutor are intrinsically more enjoyable than studying flashcards, the increase in enjoyment was less dramatic.</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/02/23/boring-boring-pleasant/">said earlier</a> I think there&#8217;s an evolutionary reason for this effect: The thirst for knowledge (= novelty) created by walking pushed us to explore and learn about our surroundings. One interesting feature of my discovery about treadmill and flashcards is that it may take better advantage of this mechanism than did ordinary Stone-Age life &#8212; <em>better </em>in the sense that more pleasure/minute can be derived. In the Stone Age, novelty, new dry knowledge, was hard to come by. You could only walk so fast. After a while, it was hard to walk far enough away to be in a new place. Whereas I can easily switch from flashcards I&#8217;ve learned to new ones. An example of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_Stimuli"><em>supranormal stimulus</em></a>.</p>

					<p>A few years ago the Chinese people invented a new noun: <em>guan er dai</em> (å®˜äºŒä»£), meaning the children of government officials. There was already <em>fu er dai</em>, meaning the children of rich people.</p>
<p>The reason for the new term is that <em>guan er dai</em> act badly. A few weeks ago at Hebei University, a <em>guan er dai</em>, driving a car on campus, hit and killed a girl. Angry bystanders gathered around the car. &#8220;My father is Li Gang!&#8221; shouted the <em>guan er dai</em>. Li Gang is a mid-level police official. Not especially powerful, but powerful enough. Hubei University covered up the incident.</p>
<p>Government officials have always been very powerful, said the friend who told me this. But only recently have people become aware of this. This is why <em>guan er dai</em> is a new term.</p>
<p>A few years ago a Tsinghua sociology professor and a graduate student wrote a book about the hierarchy within Chinese society. Government officials on top, below them business people, and so on. Perhaps farmers at the bottom. The government did not allow this book to be published &#8212; &#8220;we are not on top of society, we are the servants!&#8221; said a government official. All that work, down the drain.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> The reckless driver was sentenced to three years in prison. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/world/asia/18li.html?hp">a long article</a> about this.</p>

					<p>In Chinese supermarkets now and then you see a large and a small version of something taped together &#8212; for the price of the large version! For example, a quart of milk and a pint of milk taped together, sold at the price of one quart. <em>Wow</em>, you think, <em>for the same price I get 50% more</em>.<br />
Today I looked closely at one of these deals. The milk was several days older than the rest of the milk for sale. I realized it was the Chinese equivalent of putting a day-old sticker on something and selling it at half-price. Day-old stickers have negative connotations (&#8220;stale&#8221;) but the taped packages have positive ones (&#8220;your lucky day&#8221;).</p>

					<p>I have 80 Chinese characters (flashcards for children) taped to a wall of my Beijing apartment. I add about five per day. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/09/30/new-idea-about-learning-chinese/">I wrote about this earlier</a>, before starting. So far it&#8217;s working. With almost no effort, no discipline, I know what almost all of them mean. I test myself a little whenever I&#8217;m in that room. This is a vast improvement over several previous attempts to learn the characters, such as studying flashcards the usual way or using <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a>, a flashcard program.</p>
<p>I ruefully realize this is an application of something I thought of many years ago: the forces we can turn on and off are much weaker than pre-existing forces we can only take advantage of. Burning coal is a force we can turn on and off. Solar power is a pre-existing force we can take advantage of (and which almost everyone in Beijing uses to dry clothes). The sun shines no matter what we do. Deliberate studying we can turn on and off. We can study or not. In contrast, I am inevitably going to be in that room. Taping characters to the wall takes advantage of that.</p>

					<p>I asked an American friend who&#8217;s been in China for a year how the year had changed her. She told a story:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was in a restaurant in Inner Mongolia. This guy was going around smashing things, throwing glasses. He was drunk. I was shocked. I expected a strong reaction: <strong>Get out of my restaurant!</strong> That&#8217;s not what happened. There was no strong reaction. The guy finally left and the staff cleaned up the mess he made.

					<p>I asked several Tsinghua students what they thought about Liu Xiaobo, the imprisoned Chinese dissident, winning the Nobel Peace Prize. There was a wide range of answers:</p>
<p>1. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sensitive subject,&#8221; said one student. And said no more.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;The Nobel Prize always seems to involve China,&#8221; said another student. Maybe she meant the Peace Prize in 1989 to the Dalai Lama and the more recent Literature prize to Gao Xingjian, but I&#8217;m not sure. Politely changing the subject.</p>
<p>3. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about what he stands for,&#8221; said another student (a freshman).</p>
<p>4. &#8220;Now is not the right time for his ideas. They would interfere with economic progress,&#8221; said a student who is a member of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>5. &#8220;Many people say because the European economy is bad, they gave the prize to someone who will never collect the money [because he's imprisoned],&#8221; said another student. She added that receiving the prize will be bad for Liu. Because it was &#8220;a great shame for China&#8221; (meaning the government), they will increase his prison sentence.</p>

					<p>An American friend wondered about Chinese reaction to Liu Xiaobo winning the Nobel Peace Prize. So I sent a text message to four Chinese friends: &#8220;Did u know chinese dissident won nobel peace prize?&#8221;</p>
<p>Six hours later I hadn&#8217;t received any replies. I phoned one of them. She hadn&#8217;t received my message. I saw it hadn&#8217;t gone through: &#8220;Unable to send message&#8221;. I tried again. Failed again. Then I tried to send &#8220;did u know chinese dissident won prize?&#8221; Success. I tried the earlier message, with &#8220;nobel peace prize&#8221;. Fail. Tried the shorter message. Success.</p>
<p>Messages almost never fail, so it was clearly censorship. One of my friends said the same about messages in Chinese: &#8220;We can&#8217;t send email or text messages&#8221; about it. She had heard about the prize from her classmates. She didn&#8217;t know how they had learned about it. Another Chinese friend read it on a website. Later it was gone.</p>
<p>I thought of the boy who cried wolf. One day there was a wolf. But no one believed him.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/world/asia/07fraud.html?pagewanted=all">From the New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last December, a British journal that specializes in crystal formations  announced that it was withdrawing more than 70 papers by Chinese authors  whose research was of questionable originality or rigor. . . . â€œEven fake papers count because nobody actually reads them,â€ said Mr.  Fang, who is more widely known by his pen name, Fang Zhouzi, and whose  Web site, <a title="New Threads Web site" href="http://www.xys.org/">New Threads</a>, has exposed more than 900 instances of fakery, some involving university presidents and nationally lionized researchers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently a Tsinghua colleague asked me to fix the English in his paper. Most paragraphs required a few changes every sentence but here and there were whole paragraphs with no mistakes. Presumably he copied them from somewhere else. The material in them was boring &#8212; it was like copying from the phone book &#8212; so it was hard to care (he wasn&#8217;t taking credit for anyone else&#8217;s ideas) but I wonder if he realized how obvious it was. I don&#8217;t mean this is typical. I have looked at several other papers by Chinese authors and found no patches of perfect English.</p>
<p>The article begins with a false claim by a Chinese doctor &#8212; and of course these are truly damaging. In my experience, false claims by American doctors are common. An example is my surgeon recommending an operation that, she said, evidence showed would benefit me. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/09/13/the-case-of-the-missing-evidence/">There was no such evidence</a>. One value of self-experimentation is that you can <strong>find out</strong> if a medicine works, rather than take your doctor&#8217;s word for it. I became impressed with self-experimentation when it showed me that an acne medicine (tetracycline, an antibiotic) my dermatologist had prescribed didn&#8217;t work. Not at all. He didn&#8217;t express any doubts when he prescribed it. Call it forensic DNA testing (e.g., <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/">The Innocence Project</a>) for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Chinese people, faced with even more false claims than Americans, can benefit even more from self-experimentation.</p>
<p>Thanks to Tim Beneke.</p>

					<p><a title="æ‹† by Woods | Damien, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/woodsbarrack/5036379552/"><img width="500" height="500" alt="æ‹†" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5036379552_91f2a6c59f.jpg" /></a>I never considered taking a class to learn Chinese. Too boring, too time-consuming. I&#8217;ve tried hiring tutors and going through a textbook. Better but too close to taking a class. That didn&#8217;t last.</p>
<p>For maybe half a year I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a> (a flashcard program) to learn characters. This is better &#8212; at least it&#8217;s lasted half a year &#8212; but I don&#8217;t study it often enough.</p>
<p>A friend suggested labeling things in my apartment &#8212; put a card with the character for chair on a chair, for example. Another friend pointed out that there are children&#8217;s books with big characters (one per page). That suggested my latest idea: Put these pages on the walls of my apartment. So whenever I look at the wall it will be a kind of test. If I don&#8217;t remember the character, I can look on the underside of the card for the answer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about this: it might actually work, I now think. It doesn&#8217;t require being still, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/02/23/boring-boring-pleasant/">which I think reduces learning</a>. It spaces learning (you learn in little bits throughout the day), which is surely better than massing it. It allows great amounts of repetition. And it takes advantage of natural curiosity (whenever I see Chinese &#8212; in a sign, for example &#8212; I wonder what it means) rather than requiring discipline. As far as I can tell it requires no discipline at all. If it doesn&#8217;t work I&#8217;ll learn something about education.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today was my first day of class at Tsinghua. I am teaching a seminar called Frontiers of Psychology. There was only time for about half of the 40-odd students to identify themselves, which included saying their favorite book. Three girls said their favorite book is <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. Two said <em>The Little Prince</em>. One said <em>Harry Potter</em>. One said <em>Rebecca</em> by Daphne Du Marier (published 1938). One boy said he didn&#8217;t have a favorite book &#8212; reading books was a waste of time. One boy said his favorite book is <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>Most of them, perhaps 80%, chose a non-Chinese book as their favorite. One French, two German, the rest English (which they may have read in Chinese translation). At first I was surprised but then I realized it made sense. Chinese civilization was more advanced than European civilization for a long time but when Gutenberg invented the Western version of the printing press everything changed. In Europe, unlike China, books became cheap and literacy spread. With literacy came a book industry. A large number of Europeans have been reading books for 500 years. In contrast, the Chinese language, with thousands of characters (in contrast to 26 lower-case and 26 upper-case letters) made printing difficult. With reading material rare, so was literacy.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In downtown Berkeley I met a group of Chinese students from Beijing. They were entering freshmen at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>They said there were 40 students like them &#8212; from Beijing, entering UC Berkeley. (At Tsinghua, there will be 400 entering freshmen from Beijing.) In all of China, 13 students were admitted to Harvard, about the same number to Yale and Princeton. One of them said she&#8217;d wanted to go to Northwestern but hadn&#8217;t gotten in. Had she gone to college in China, she might have gone to Renmin University, perhaps the #3 university in China.</p>
<p>Surely their parents were wealthy, yes. But they preferred an American college to a Chinese one for two main reasons: 1. They can choose whatever major they want. At Chinese universities students are often forced into a major they don&#8217;t want if their scores are high enough to get into a prestigious university but not high enough to get into the major they want at that university. 2. They believe that if they graduate from an American university they will have more opportunities. Where did they get the idea of coming to Berkeley? I asked. Online, they said. Their English was really good.</p>
<p>The &#8220;more opportunities&#8221; may not be as simple as they think. In Beijing I know a Chinese businesswoman who hired a recent college graduate. She&#8217;d gone to college in England, indicating that her parents were wealthy. The new worker turned out to be irresponsible and had to be fired. Perhaps her parents had spoiled her. In this businesswoman&#8217;s eyes, an overseas education may now be a negative.</p>

<p>Which means: Better living standards is not just eating <em>hong shao rou</em> wearing beautiful clothes. <em><a href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Red-Cooked-Pork-Belly-Hong-Shao-Rou">Hong shao rou</a> </em>is pork belly braised in a red sauce. Maybe my favorite Chinese dish. Supposedly Chairman Mao&#8217;s favorite dish. I&#8217;m glad he said &#8220;not just&#8221; rather than &#8220;not&#8221;.</p>
