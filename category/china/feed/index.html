				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese friend of mine had a cold. After a few weeks, she was still sick.  I suggested she eat meat &#8212; it would provide the amino acids needed to make antibodies. She did want to eat meat, she said, but her mom thought that meat was bad for a sick person &#8212; an idea from Traditional Chinese Medicine, I guess.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a desire to eat meat. That was odd; I didn&#8217;t usually feel that way. I ate all the meat in the refrigerator (slices of cured meat) but it wasn&#8217;t much. I ate three eggs. That, too, was odd &#8212; usually one egg is plenty. In the evening, I distinctly wanted more meat but decided against going out to get some. This morning I woke up with the flu. I could tell by the joint pain. <em>So that&#8217;s what joint pain is</em>, I thought. I&#8217;d read about flu and <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">written about it</a>, but, before this morning, cannot remember having it.  <em>H</em><em>ow is the flu different from a cold?</em> I once tried to find out. I might not have come down with today&#8217;s case of the flu were it not for two events: yesterday&#8217;s decision not to eat meat; and, the day before, running into a friend who had just left the house after being home-bound for four days with the flu. He shook my hand twice.</p>
<p>Humans (including me) are exceedingly gullible; my evolutionary explanation is that this makes us easier to lead. Gullibility &#8212; we believe something just because an authority says it &#8212; is cement. It keeps members of a group together. Better that 10 people do one thing (e.g., live in one place) than ten things, in many cases. Pointless to waste time on unresolvable and divisive arguments. Doctors, both Western and Eastern, take advantage of our gullibility. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/08/dangerous-noise/" target="_blank">As my friend says</a>, &#8220;doctors hurt you&#8221; because they tell you to do something different from what you want to do (e.g., eat meat). What you <em>want</em> to do is actual wisdom. We&#8217;ve been shaped by evolution to want to do what is good for us and what we want to eat is a giant clue to what we should eat. In nutrition research, this line of thinking, which is called <em>dietary self-selection</em> research, is nearly moribund, in spite of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC537465/pdf/canmedaj00208-0035.pdf" target="_blank">a great 1939 article about what happened when young children ate what they wanted</a>. The idea that we want to eat what we should eat is what first led me to think <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/the-unami-hypothesis-why-i-believe-fermented-foods-are-necessary-for-health/" target="_blank">we need to eat fermented foods to be healthy</a>. Fermented foods, much more than other foods, satisfy our desire for sour, umami-flavored and complex-flavored foods. For example, it is easy to produce complexity via fermentation; it is hard to produce it in other ways.</p>
<p>As for my flu, I went to the store and got pork and duck. By evening I felt much better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a Chinese friend of mine was in first grade, she was habitually late for school. Usually about ten minutes. Her mom took her to school on a bike. One day she was 20 minutes late. The door was closed. My friend opened the door. &#8220;May I come in?&#8221; she asked the teacher. The teacher came to the door. She took my friend to the front of the class. &#8220;Here is Queen Late (迟到大王),&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, including my friend. She thought it was a funny thing to say, not mean. The name stuck. Many years later, she was called Queen Late by those who knew her in primary school. Her teacher was not a great wit. Other students at other schools were called the same thing. It was/is a standard joke.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think Chinese have, on average, a better sense of humor than Americans, but who really knows? A more interesting contrast is how lateness is handled. At UC Berkeley, about 20 years ago, I attended a large lecture class (Poli Sci 3, Comparative Politics) taught by Ken Jowitt, a political science professor. Jowitt was considered an excellent lecturer, which was why I was there, but he was also famous for being hard on students who came in late. When I was there, a student came in late. Jowitt interrupted what he was saying to point out the offender and said something derogatory.  I don&#8217;t remember what Jowitt said but I do remember thinking &#8212; as someone who also taught large lecture classes where students came in late &#8212; that he was making a mountain, an unattractive mountain, out of a molehill. It didn&#8217;t occur to me to wonder how he could have dealt with the problem in a way that made everyone laugh.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a discussion of dragonfruit (common in China), a Chinese friend pointed out that Chinese dragons and Western dragons are quite different. I was surprised, I hadn&#8217;t noticed this. My friend was right:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are two distinct cultural traditions of dragons: the <a title="European dragon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon">European dragon</a>, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies, and the <a title="Chinese dragon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon">Chinese dragon</a>, with counterparts in Japan, Korea and other East Asian countries.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" target="_blank">says Wikipedia</a>. Why two different <em>imaginary</em> animals would be quite similar isn&#8217;t obvious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I skype-chatted with <a href="http://clarissawei.com/" target="_blank">Clarissa Wei</a>, a Chinese-American journalist in Los Angeles whose <a href="http://clarissawei.com/2013/07/22/4-ways-to-enjoy-stinky-tofu-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank">post about stinky tofu in Los Angeles</a> impressed me.</p>
<p>SR What do you think of Chinese restaurants in America compared to Chinese restaurants in China?</p>
<p>CW It depends on where you&#8217;re talking about. In broad America, the Chinese food is pretty different from that of China. In places like Los Angeles and pockets of New York… it&#8217;s much more alike</p>
<p>SR I&#8217;m thinking of the best ones in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>CW It&#8217;s definitely cleaner here that&#8217;s for sure. In Los Angeles, the food quality is pretty similar. The major difference would be the price and variety. The selections are also pretty similar. The set-up in American Chinese restaurants is obviously different than the ones in China so that influences things a lot</p>
<p>SR I have never been to a Chinese restaurant in America that resembles a high-end Chinese restaurant in Beijing</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW In Los Angeles &#8212; there are a couple high-end Canto restaurants. </span>They typically are your seafood + dim sum banquet types. Lunasia is a great example.</p>
<p>SR What do you mean by the set up?</p>
<p>CW Well in China, a lot of the restaurants are literally hole-in-the-walls. There isn&#8217;t that much of a standard in terms of being neat and sanitary.</p>
<p>SR There is vastly more range in China, both better and worse</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW In the rural countrysides, it&#8217;s out of people&#8217;s homes. </span>But in America, everyone has to have at least some degree of sanitation.</p>
<p>SR Chinese restaurants in China are more playful. Like a toilet restaurant, for example.<span id="more-11044"></span></p>
<p>CW Very true. Yeah they&#8217;re opening one of those in LA.</p>
<p>SR Or a restaurant where everyone says hello when you enter and goodbye when you leave</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW There&#8217;s also a Taiwanese &#8220;Hooters&#8221; in L.A. A</span> lot of the Taiwanese breakfast eateries in L.A. have that &#8220;cutesy&#8221; vibe.</p>
<p>SR When you were in China were you in any way disappointed by the Chinese restaurants?</p>
<p>CW I was in China in 2011 for 4 months as part of a study abroad program. I was disappointed mostly because I always got sick.</p>
<p>SR  What city?</p>
<p>CW Shanghai. But I travelled to Guilin, Dunhuang, Beijing. I got sick from just the regular restaurants on my street. Some were marketed as higher-end. I lost 10 pounds from throwing up. Mind you, I go to Taiwan yearly and that never happens.</p>
<p>SR The first time I went to China I was sick every 2 days, but after that I was fine.</p>
<p>CW I think my toleration for bacteria is pretty low.</p>
<p>SR I get sick no more often in Beijing than in Berkeley. [But in Beijing I eat Korean and Japanese food mostly.]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW </span> That&#8217;s surprising. I was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donghuamen_Night_Market" target="_blank">Donghuamen</a> [a night market selling strange food] in Beijing. Did an article on that place. But I just felt like throwing up because the streets reeked of trash.</p>
<p>SR The cheap restaurants scare me. They use recycled cooking oil.</p>
<p>CW I think that&#8217;s changing now with the media coverage on the Chinese food scandals. But in places like Los Angeles..the food is pretty up to par in terms of &#8220;authenticity&#8221;.</p>
<p>SR How was the food in the various Chinese cities besides Shanghai?</p>
<p>CW It was alright. I get turned off when a restaurant is dirty to be honest. But that may just be because of my American upbringing. It really influences how I consume the food and how much I eat of it. <span style="font-size: 13px;">When I was in Dunhuang, there was a vendor making daoxiaomian but he kept on coughing over and over. And we watched him make the dish and serve it to us. I felt disgusted but we were starving.</span></p>
<p>SR What did you think of the food expertise of the Chinese people you met in China?</p>
<p>CW I learned a lot about Chinese food in China from my Chinese teacher. That&#8217;s when I started to gain in interest in the regional differences. <span style="font-size: 13px;">The oyster omelette for example in Xiamen is similar to the one in Taiwan, but crispier and thinner</span></p>
<p>SR It was very hard to buy a kitchen timer in Beijing because I was told no one uses them when they cook.</p>
<p>CW No one uses fancy gadgets or exact measurements there. It&#8217;s all passed down and family recipes which is the beauty of it.</p>
<p>SR My students at Tsinghua are more connoisseurs of food than my Berkeley students. A lot more.</p>
<p>CW Food is such a central theme of the Chinese culture. There&#8217;s a fascination with Western food too. In Shanghai, my first article for CNN was &#8220;Top Western Restaurants in Shanghai&#8221;. I brought my Shanghainese friends along to one of the places &#8212; a bagel places &#8212; and they were fascinated.</p>
<p>SR I went to the best Korean restaurant I&#8217;ve been to outside Korea in Shanghai.</p>
<p>CW Shanghai has a tradition of really embracing foreign cooking traditions. One of the best fine dining restaurants I&#8217;ve been to was in Shanghai, Mr. and Mrs. Bund.</p>
<p>SR Do people in Shanghai understand how good the food is in Japan?</p>
<p>CW I think so. But a lot of Chinese people really don&#8217;t have the opportunity to travel abroad. They don&#8217;t have a feel or the exposure to foreign tastes as much as Americans do. In Taiwan, there&#8217;s a fascination with the Japanese. Obviously because of the occupation of the Japanese but a lot of the high-end Taiwanese restos are Japanese influenced.</p>
<p>SR Controlling for age who did you think are the more adventurous eaters, Americans or Chinese &#8212; I mean the ones you know.</p>
<p>CW Chinese hands down.</p>
<p>SR That&#8217;s interesting, I always worry that my students won&#8217;t like this or that. [At least, they draw the line at eating insects.]</p>
<p>CW Just because Chinese cuisine has a variety of meats and offal and &#8220;bizarre&#8221; parts you know. So they&#8217;re much more open to try …. snails from France than your average American. Because snails are a Chinese dish too.<br />
Also in Chinese culture, you&#8217;re taught to eat anything and everything that&#8217;s presented to you. It&#8217;s rude to refuse.</p>
<p>SR A friend of mine said that Chinese (in practice) is a language of verbs, English is a language of nouns. One of the verbs is &#8220;eat&#8221;. Parents tell children: &#8220;eat&#8221;.</p>
<p>CW Yes. Americans have the luxury of being more picky &#8212; look at the whole gluten free, vegan movement in these metropolitan places. If you go into a Chinese restaurant in China and say you&#8217;re vegetarian &#8212; they don&#8217;t really know how to work with you. Some places will just roll their eyes.</p>
<p>SR After you came back from Shanghai to Los Angeles, how did you view American Chinese restaurants differently? The authentic ones.</p>
<p>CW I appreciated it a lot more. The food here is good and it won&#8217;t give me food poisoning. Sanitation was like the biggest worry in China. An article recently came out that said the ice from the KFC in China had more bacteria than toilet water.</p>
<p>SR  I never go to KFC in China. Now I have been vindicated in that decision</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW The egg tarts there are fantastic. Modeled after the original Macau egg tart recipe apparently. </span></p>
<p>SR There should be a category: best food in worst restaurant. Also worst food in best restaurant.</p>
<p>CW Chinese restaurants have such extensive menus, it&#8217;s always easy to find a bad item.</p>
<p>SR I was impressed that Chinese restaurants managed to make mashed potatoes slightly interesting. That&#8217;s baby food! They added raspberry sauce.</p>
<p>CW Again &#8212; fascination with Western food.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/american-pravda-liberal-bias/comment-page-1/" target="_blank">This post by Ron Unz</a> made me wonder: What really happened when student protesters were removed from Tiananmen Square 25 years ago? Unz pointed to <a href="http://www.bearcanada.com/" target="_blank">a strange website</a> with undated blog posts (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/06/assorted-links-260/" target="_blank">mentioned earlier</a>), which <a href="http://www.bearcanada.com/china/letstalkabouttam.html">claimed</a> that the students were not harmed, in contrast to the usual Western view that many were harmed, even killed. I didn&#8217;t take the website seriously but I had to admit my ignorance.<span id="more-10603"></span></p>
<p>I asked several Chinese friends about it. One dared reply. She wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>My mom once told me that she was near Beijing when the event happened. She said everything is a mess, no one can go into or out from Beijing. The army is everywhere and people are all in an angry mood, no matter the a-rmy (try to pass the possible check so use -) or the citizens. She said the students are innocent, they didn&#8217;t start the whole thing. And indeed the army was hurt first. But students are young and easy to be incited. Once the army began to take serious method, they didn&#8217;t care whether you are a student or a mob or a citizen, some innocent students hurt in the turmoil and other students try to gather together to fight back. Then everything began to lose control. After this event, all the students who participate in the sit-in were sent to poor countryside far away and never get a chance to get back to big cities in their whole life. (At that time, all the students are getting job position directly from the govern-ment, they don&#8217;t have options to choose.) My mom told me some female students were sent to countryside and raped by the local people, or have to marry to the local farmers even they have high education.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>All</strong> the student protesters, according to my friend&#8217;s mother, &#8220;were sent to poor countryside&#8221; for <strong>the rest of their lives</strong>. I hadn&#8217;t read this anywhere, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989" target="_blank">including <em>Wikipedia</em></a>. The fate of the protesters was far worse than I had been told by Western media.</p>
<p>My friend&#8217;s mother could be wrong. Even eyewitnesses can be wrong. But what people actually say, the story they tell, matters infinitely more than the truth.</p>
<p>I am optimistic that the story of Edward Snowden will begin to change how we talk about whistleblowing. Recent stories are not encouraging. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Whitacre" target="_blank">Mark Whitacre</a> (Archer Daniels Midland) spent 8 years in prison. That he suffered from bipolar disorder might be taken to mean that only crazy people whistleblow. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/us/a-tobacco-whistle-blower-s-life-is-transformed.html" target="_blank">Jeffrey Wigand</a> (tobacco) was played in a movie by Russell Crowe but went from a $300,000+/year job to a $30,000/year job. Bradley Manning faces a very long prison sentence. Julian Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for a year, afraid to leave.</p>
<p>Whereas Edward Snowden, whose leaked information is at least as important, has not yet suffered terrible or even humiliating consequences. Maybe he will live the rest of his life in Iceland &#8212; as a hero. He won&#8217;t just have released enormously useful information, he will have set an encouraging example. That might be his biggest effect on the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long ago, a friend told me that when she was in first grade, she had a lot of pennies. She knew how to add but not subtract so after she spent some, she would have to count them again to know how many were left.</p>
<p>I have finally reached the last lesson (Lesson 12) in my beginning Chinese textbook, which I have been using (fitfully) for more than a year. Later lessons build on earlier lessons. When I didn&#8217;t know a word in a later lesson, I scanned the new-word lists from earlier lessons to find it. I have just discovered there is a word index.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine taught at Harvard for a few years. Her husband needed a job, so he taught a writing class. He said his students were so bad it appeared to be an experiment: <em>How stupid can you be and succeed at Harvard? </em>They had not been admitted based on SAT scores or grades, that was clear. In <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/">a recent article called &#8220;The Myth of American Meritocracy&#8221;</a>, Ron Unz described considerable evidence of exactly what my friend&#8217;s husband noticed: Harvard admission not based on the usual &#8220;meritocratic&#8221; measures, such as SAT scores and grades. For example, he found evidence of an Asian quota. If Asians weren&#8217;t penalized for being Asian, far more would be admitted.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/meritocracy-admitting-my-mistakes/" target="_blank">a follow-up article</a>, Unz wrote:<span id="more-9627"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Near the beginning of my article [about meritocracy] I had noted that although complaints about official corruption of every sort are a leading topic on the Chinese Internet and also in Western media coverage, I had never once heard such a claim about admissions to elite Chinese universities.  This led me to conclude that the process was entirely meritocratic, and a couple of individuals with good knowledge of China confirmed this.  However, during one of my recent Yale Law events, a student from China stated that he and his friends were firmly convinced that any of China’s 350 Central Committee members could easily obtain an admissions slot for his friends or relatives, so my claim was incorrect.  This conflicting evidence may be reconciled if the number of such corrupt admissions each year is so tiny—perhaps a few hundred out of over eight million—that it is completely invisible to the general public.  I should note that the New York Times just ran another major story on colleges in China, emphasizing every possible unfair aspect of the system, but nonetheless indicating that admissions were entirely meritocratic and objective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is one reason that there is zero discussion of corruption in admission to elite Chinese universities (such as Tsinghua, where I teach): Rich Chinese universally want their children to go to college outside China, especially America. The more money you have, the easier this is. I&#8217;d guess <strong>all</strong> children of Central Committee members attend college outside China. None of them attend Tsinghua, as far as I know. At least among my students, this is utterly obvious &#8212; that education outside China is superior and anyone who can go outside China will. The brake on this is purely cost. One of my students said she didn&#8217;t want to burden her parents with the cost.</p>
<p>The test that Chinese high school students take to get into college is the <em>gaokao</em>. One of my students got <strong>the highest <em>gaokao</em> score in Beijing</strong>. An astonishing achievement. <em>He didn&#8217;t get in to any American university</em>.<em> </em>The Chinese public was shocked. Many newspaper articles were written about it. The rest of my students knew about it. His family is not well-off. This is why he failed where thousands of Chinese students from rich families &#8212; who didn&#8217;t bother to take the <em>gaokao, </em>but surely would have had a lower score &#8211; succeeded. Although he went to Tsinghua as a freshman, he too wanted to escape Chinese higher education. First he transferred to the University of Hong Kong. Then he transferred to MIT.</p>
<p>Why is Chinese higher education so bad that everyone who can avoids it? One of my students (a psychology major) said that as the economy quickly improved, the government quickly expanded the college education system. There weren&#8217;t enough good teachers to fill the slots. That&#8217;s one reason. Another reason is a certain ethos. I asked a friend of mine, a Tsinghua student not majoring in psychology, &#8220;In what fraction of your classes do the professors lecture by reading from the textbook?&#8221; 80%, she said. That&#8217;s at Tsinghua. Below Tsinghua it&#8217;s worse. Of course students go to college outside China for reasons that have nothing to do with quality. The most obvious is prestige: It is prestigious to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Lack of higher education meritocracy in China has a more subtle aspect. It is much easier to get into elite universities, such as Tsinghua, if you live in Beijing or Shanghai than if you live elsewhere, especially poor provinces. Is this unfair? It isn&#8217;t easy to say because the <em style="font-size: 13px;">gaokao</em> is different in different places. I don&#8217;t know the official reason for this (different textbooks?), but the difference in tests makes it easier to have lower admissions cutoff scores for students from Beijing and Shanghai. A Beijing student at Tsinghua will usually have a lower <em style="font-size: 13px;">gaokao</em> score than a student at Tsinghua from a poor province. Of course it is much more expensive to live in Beijing and Shanghai than elsewhere. Moreover, a big chunk of the <em style="font-size: 13px;">gaokao</em> is about English proficiency. A student&#8217;s English proficiency depends heavily on amount and quality of English education, which depends heavily on family income. The richer you are, the better your children&#8217;s English.</p>
<p>All this makes political sense. Richer people &#8212; whose children have better English &#8212; have more political power than the less rich. Those who live in Beijing and Shanghai have more political power than people in poor provinces. Allowing their children get into Tsinghua with lower <em>gaokao </em>scores (Beijing and Shanghai residents) or writing the <em>gaokao</em> so that their children have an advantage (English proficiency) is one way to keep them happy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An American writer named James McGregor (in <em>One Billion Customers</em>) called China &#8220;a nation of bookworms&#8221;. In China, entry into college is heavily controlled by a nationwide test called the <em>gao kao</em> taken near the end of high school. For hundreds of years, China had the most sophisticated civil service entrance exams in the world. Chinese students study much harder than American students. Amy Chua&#8217;s <em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</em> (in which a mother puts a huge amount of pressure on her daughters to succeed in conventional ways) was presented by Chua as reflecting Chinese parenting values. It&#8217;s true that Chinese parents push their children much harder to do well in school than American parents.</p>
<p>All of which might lead unsuspecting Americans to believe that Chinese people value being a good student. Not at all. A Chinese friend explained to me that being called &#8220;a good student&#8221; is essentially an insult. &#8220;You are a good student&#8221; is what you say to someone when you can&#8217;t think of anything nice to say. It means</p>
<p>1. You are not interesting.</p>
<p>2. You have no sense of humor.</p>
<p>3. You have no interests outside of school.</p>
<p><em>Drone</em> might be the closest English equivalent to the Chinese &#8220;good student&#8221;, except that no one would ever say to someone &#8220;you are a drone&#8221; and the meaning of the term has recently changed (to mean mini-planes flown remotely).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you open the American edition of <em>Forbes</em>, you will find articles about the richest people in America. If you open the Russian edition, you will find articles about the richest people in Russia. If you open the Chinese edition, you will find articles about the richest people in America.</p>
<p>A Russian friend of mine noticed this. He happened to know an sophomore economics major at Tsinghua. It is incredibly difficult to get into Tsinghua and the economics major is the most desirable major of all. To be an economics major at Tsinghua you need a test score that is in something like the top 1 out of 100,000. Staggeringly high. My Russian friend asked the Tsinghua economics major, &#8220;Who is the richest person in China?&#8221;</p>
<p>The economics major didn&#8217;t know. He seemed a little angry. &#8220;Why should I know? We&#8217;ve never been taught that,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-22-13.58.27.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8250" title="2012-11-22 13.58.27 chinese character memory wall" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-22-13.58.27-400x300.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Two years ago I taped a bunch of Chinese flash cards (Chinese character on one side, English meaning on the other) to my living room wall (shown above). <em>I&#8217;ll study them in off moments</em>, I thought. I didn&#8217;t. It was embarrassing when guests pointed to a card and said, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; But not embarrassing enough.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I can&#8217;t remember why, I decided to test myself: <em>how many do I know?</em> About 20%. <em>I&#8217;ll try to learn more</em>, I thought. I was astonished how fast I learned the rest. It took little time and almost no effort. I didn&#8217;t need &#8220;study sessions&#8221;. I glanced at the array now and then, looked for cards I didn&#8217;t know yet, and flipped them to find out the answer. After a few days I knew all of them.<span id="more-8099"></span></p>
<p>I had been using conventional methods (flash cards studied in ordinary ways, Anki, Skritter) and an unconventional method (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/walking-and-learning/" target="_blank">treadmill study</a>) to learn this material for years. In spite of spending more than a hundred hours on each method, I had never gotten very far. I might get to 500 characters and backslide due to lack of study. Treadmill walking while studying made studying much more pleasant, but I found I would still prefer to watch TV rather than study Chinese. Maybe part of the problem was too many days skipped. After you skip four days, for example, you have a discouragingly large number of cards to review. Plainly these methods work for others. They didn&#8217;t work for me.</p>
<p>After my success with the two-year-old cards, I put up another array (8 x 13). I already knew about 40% of them. I learned the rest in a day or so. Then I put up a 10 x 12 array. I tested myself on them one morning. I knew 30 of them. I studied them during the day for maybe 30 minutes in little pieces throughout the day. The next morning I tested myself again (about 12 hours from the last time I had studied them). Now I knew 105 &#8212; I had learned 75 in one day, almost effortlessly. That day I studied for a few minutes. The next morning I tested myself again. Now I knew all but one of them.</p>
<p>I did not notice any facilitation of learning when I studied flash cards while walking around. In that case, unlike this one, (a) they were in roughly the same position relative to my body and (b) had no consistent physical location. I noticed the same facilitation of learning during a Chinese lesson in a cafe. I was having trouble remembering three Chinese words (e.g., the Chinese word that means graduate). I wrote each of them on a piece of paper with the English on one side and the Chinese on the other. I put the three pieces of paper at widely-separated places on the table. I studied them briefly, a few seconds each. That was enough. Five days later I still remember them (having used them a few times since then).  This happened in a place (a cafe) with which I wasn&#8217;t familiar, unlike my living room. Maybe the general principle will be <em>it is much easier to learn an association if it is in a new place</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very early in my use of this method, but I doubt it&#8217;s a fluke. It connects with several things we (= psychology professors) already know. 1. The mnemonic device called <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci" target="_blank">the method of loci</a></em>. You put things you want to learn in different places in a well-remembered landscape (e.g. different places in a building you know well). Usually the method is used to learn lists, such as the digits of pi or the order of cards in a deck. You place different items in the list in different places in the imagined place. Then you &#8220;walk&#8221; (in your imagination) through the imagined place. The method dates back to ancient Rome. 2. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_theory" target="_blank"><em>The power of interference</em></a><em>. </em>Thousands of experiments have shown that learning X makes it harder to learn similar Y. X and Y might be two lists, for example. The greater the similarity, the bigger the effect. What you learn on Monday makes it harder to learn stuff on Tuesday (proactive interference); what you learn on Tuesday makes it harder to remember what you learned on Monday (retroactive interference).  To anyone familiar with these experiments, my discovery has a simple &#8220;explanation&#8221;: spatial interference. 3. <em>Evolutionary plausibility</em>. The study of printed materials (e.g., books) is so recent it is hard to imagine our brain has evolved to make it easy.  In contrast, thousands and millions of years ago we had to learn about things in different places. Learning about food and danger in different places was especially important. When language arrived, the necessary learning (at first, attaching names to objects) is quite similar to my learning because the named objects were in different places. The study of vitamins and to some extent my work (especially the power of morning faces) show how hard it can be to figure out what we need for our brains and bodies to work well. How non-intuitive the answers may be.</p>
<p>These results suggest a new mnemonic device: Stand in front of an empty wall and imagine on the wall the associations you want to learn, each association in a different place like flashcards. This is a fast way of putting each association in a different place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Tsinghua University, the Second Annual Chinese International Conference on Positive Psychology has just begun. The first speaker was Martin Seligman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and former president of the American Psychological Association (the main professional group of American psychologists). Seligman is more responsible for the Positive Psychology movement than anyone else. Here are some things I liked and disliked about his talk.</p>
<p>Likes:</p>
<p>1. Countries, such as England, have started to measure well-being in big frequent surveys (e.g., 2000 people every month) and some politicians, such as David Cameron, have vowed to increase well-being as measured by these surveys. This is a vast improvement over trying to increase how much money people make. The more common and popular and publicized this assessment becomes &#8212; this went unsaid &#8212; the more powerful psychologists will become, at the expense of economists. Seligman showed a measure of well-being for several European countries. Denmark was highest, Portugal lowest. His next slide showed the overall result of the same survey for China: 11.83%. However, by then I had forgotten the numerical scores on the preceding graph so I couldn&#8217;t say where this score put China.</p>
<p>2. Work by Angela Duckworth, another Penn professor, shows that &#8220;GRIT&#8221; (which means something like perseverance) is a much better predictor of school success than IQ. This work was mentioned in only one slide so I can&#8217;t elaborate. I had already heard about this work from Paul Tough in a talk about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/books/review/how-children-succeed-by-paul-tough.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">his new book</a>.</p>
<p>3. Teaching school children something about positive psychology (it was unclear what) raised their grades a bit.</p>
<p>Dislikes:</p>
<p>1. Three years ago, Seligman got $125 million from the US Army to reduce suicides, depression, etc. (At the birth of the positive psychology movement, Seligman proclaimed that psychologists spent too much time studying suicide, depression, etc.) I don&#8217;t mind the grant. What bothered me was a slide used to illustrate the results of an experiment. I couldn&#8217;t understand it. The experiment seems to have had two groups. The results from each group appeared to be on different graphs (making comparison difficult, of course).</p>
<p>2. Why does a measure of well-being not include health? This wasn&#8217;t explained.</p>
<p>3. Seligman said that a person&#8217;s level of happiness was &#8220;genetically determined&#8221; and therefore was difficult or impossible to change. (He put his own happiness in &#8220;the bottom 50%&#8221;.) Good grief. I&#8217;ve blogged several times about how the fact that something is &#8220;genetically-determined&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean it cannot be profoundly changed by the environment. Quite a misunderstanding by an APA president and Penn professor.</p>
<p>4. He mentioned a few studies that showed optimism (or lack of it) was a risk factor for heart disease after you adjust for the traditional risk factors (smoking, exercise, etc.). There is a whole school of &#8220;social epidemiology&#8221; that has shown the importance of stuff like where you are in the social hierarchy for heart disease. It&#8217;s at least 30 years old. Seligman appeared unaware of this. If you&#8217;re going to talk about heart disease epidemiology and claim to find new risk factors, at least know the basics.</p>
<p>5. Seligman said that China had &#8220;a good safety net.&#8221; People in China save a large fraction of their income at least partly because they are afraid of catastrophic medical costs. Poor people in China, when they get seriously sick, come to Beijing or Shanghai for treatment, perhaps because they don&#8217;t trust their local doctor (or the local doctor&#8217;s treatment failed). In Beijing or Shanghai, they are forced to pay enormous sums (e.g., half their life&#8217;s savings) for treatment. That&#8217;s the opposite of a good safety net.</p>
<p>6. Given the attention and resources and age of the Positive Psychology movement, the talk seemed short on new ways to make people better off. There was an experiment with school children where the main point appeared to be their grades improved a bit. A measure of how they treat each other also improved a bit. (Marilyn Watson, the wife of a Berkeley psychology professor, was doing a study about getting school kids to treat each other better long before the Positive Psychology movement.) There was an experiment with the U.S. Army I couldn&#8217;t understand. That&#8217;s it, in a 90-minute talk. At the beginning of his talk Seligman said he was going to tell us things &#8220;your grandmother didn&#8217;t know.&#8221; I can&#8217;t say he did that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ecologists understand the exploit/explore distinction. When an animal looks for food, it can either exploit (use previous knowledge of where food is) or explore (try to learn more about where food is). With ants, the difference is visible. Trail of ants to a food source: exploit. Solitary wandering ant: explore. With other animals, the difference is more subtle. You might think that when a rat presses a bar for food, that is pure exploitation. However, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0k16r0pt">my colleagues and I found that when expectation of food was lower, there was more variation</a> &#8212; more exploration &#8212; in <em>how</em> the rat pressed the bar. In a wide range of domains (genetics, business), less expectation of reward leads to more exploration.  In business, this is a common observation. For example, yesterday I read <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2012/04/washington-post-watergate">an article about the <em>Washington Post</em></a> that said its leaders failed to explore enough because they had a false sense of security provide by their Kaplan branch. &#8220;Thanks to Kaplan, the Post Company felt less pressure to make hard strategic choices—and less pressure to venture in new directions,&#8221; wrote Sarah Ellison.</p>
<p>Striking the right balance between exploitation and exploration is crucial. If an animal exploits too much, it will starve when its supply of food runs out. If it explores too much, it will starve right away. Every instance of collapse in Jared Diamond&#8217;s <em>Collapse: How Socieities Choose to Fail or Succeed</em> was plausibly due to too much exploitation, too little exploration (which Diamond, even though he is a biologist, fails to say). I&#8217;ve posted several times about my discovery that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/walking-and-learning/">treadmill walking made studying Chinese more pleasant</a>. I believe walking creates a thirst for dry knowledge. My evolutionary explanation is that this pushed prehistoric humans to explore more.</p>
<p>I have never heard an economist make this point: the need for proper balance between exploit and explore. <span id="more-7683"></span>It is relevant in a large fraction of discussions about how to spend money. For example, yesterday I listened to <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/09/frank_and_rober.html">the latest EconTalk podcast</a>, a debate between Bob Frank and Russ Roberts about whether it would be a good idea for the American government to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure projects (fix bridges, etc.). Frank said it would create jobs, and so on &#8212; the usual argument. Roberts said if fixing bridges was such a good idea, why hadn&#8217;t this choice already been made? Roberts could have said, but didn&#8217;t, that massive government shovel-ready expenditures, such as $2 trillion spent on infrastructure repair, inevitably push the exploit/explore balance toward exploit, which is dangerous. This is an argument against all Keynesian stimulus-type spending. I have heard countless arguments about such spending. I have never heard it made. If you want examples of how the American economy suffers from a profound lack of useful new ideas, look at health care. As far as I know, there are no recorded instances of a society dying because of too much exploration. The problem is always too much exploitation. People at the top &#8212; with a tiny number of exceptions, such as the Basques &#8212; overestimate the stability of their position. At the end of <em>The Economy of Cities</em>, Jane Jacobs says that if a spaceship landed on Earth, she would want to know how their civilization avoided overexploitation. When societies exploit too much and explore too little, said Jacobs, problems (in our society, problems such as obesity, autism, autoimmune disease, etc.) stack up unsolved. Today is China&#8217;s birthday. Due to overexploitation, I believe China is in even worse economic shape than America. Ron Unz, whom I respect, <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/chinas-rise-americas-fall/">misses this</a>.</p>
<p>My broad point is that a lot of economic thinking, especially about growth and development, is one-dimensional (measuring primarily growth of previously existing goods and services &#8212; exploitation) when it should be two-dimensional (measuring both (a) growth of existing stuff and (b) creation of new goods and services). Exploration (successful exploration) is inevitably tiny compared to exploitation, but it is crucial there be enough of it. If there is a textbook that makes this point, I haven&#8217;t seen it. An example of getting it right is Hugh Sinclair&#8217;s excellent new book <a href="http://www.microfinancetransparency.com/"><em>Confessions of a Microfinance Heretic</em></a> (copy sent me by publisher) that debunks microcredit. Leaving aside the very high interest rates, the use of microcredit loans to buy TVs, and so on, microcredit is <em>still</em> a bad idea because the money is, at best, used for a business that copies an existing business. (The higher the interest rate, the less risk a loan recipient dares take.)  When a new business copies an already-existing business, you are taking an existing pie (e.g., demand for milk, if the loan has been used to buy a cow and sell its milk) and dividing it into one more piece. The pie does not get bigger. As Sinclair says, the notion that dividing existing pies into more pieces will &#8220;create a poverty-free world&#8221; is, uh, <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/yunus-lecture-en.html">not worthy of a Nobel Prize</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s hard to measure growth of useful knowledge. (It is perfectly possible for a company to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/09/11/modern-veblen-flight-from-data/">waste its entire R&amp;D budget</a>.) However, I am quite sure that realism does better than make-believe &#8212; and the notion that growth of GDP is a satisfactory metric of economic growth is make-believe. If you&#8217;ve ever been sick, or gone to college, and have a sense of history, you will have noticed the profound stagnation in two unavoidable sectors (health care and education) of our economy. That are growing really fast.</p>
