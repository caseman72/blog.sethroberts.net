					<p>Someone who wishes to be anonymous wrote me:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had been taking 400 IU D3+calcium morning noon and night for years. I usually fell asleep fitfully. My sleep was rarely uninterrupted throughout the night.</p>
<p>After reading your blog, I started taking all three pills in the morning. Getting to sleep was easier, but sleep was still usually fitful.</p>
<p>After more reading of your blog, I stopped the D3+calcium and switched to 7000 IU of D3 every morning. Within a couple days, my usual pattern became that I fell asleep quickly and slept soundly through the night.</p>
<p>It is now three weeks, and I continue to enjoy excellent sleep. I noticed no changes in energy or mood.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked some questions.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m an academic (professor of decision sciences), 52 years old. I live in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>What you mean by &#8220;I fell asleep fitfully&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>Even if I was tired, sleep did not come easily. I had no worries, so it wasn&#8217;t that.</p>
<p><strong>How long did/does it usually took/take you to fall asleep under the three conditions?</strong></p>
<p>Original 400 IU D3+ calcium 3 times/day: 1/2 hour was usual.<br />
All 3 are taken in morning: 15-30 minutes, but still awakening in the night frequently<br />
7000 IU in morning: 10-15 minutes, and sleeping like a log.</p>
<p><strong>What time do you wake up? </strong><strong>What time do you take the 7000 IU? </strong></p>
<p>I usually wake between 7 and 7:15.  Sometimes I head straight for the kitchen (where the vitamins are stored) and I take them immediately.  Other times I head for the shower and then to the kitchen, whereupon I take the vitamins.</p>
<p><strong>What brand of Vitamin D3 do you take now?</strong></p>

					<p>Paleo Hacks has <a href="http://paleohacks.com/questions/98166/vitamin-d-morning-seth-roberts-versus-night-robb-wolf/98247#98247">a thread about timing of Vitamin D3</a>. Better in morning (my and several other people&#8217;s experience) or evening (Robb Wolf&#8217;s experience)?</p>
<p>This answer supports morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>I prefer taking it in the morning. I think it helps set my circadian rhythm.</p></blockquote>
<p>This answer supports night:</p>
<blockquote><p>I prefer it at night. I find I sleep better.</p></blockquote>
<p>This answer supports morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had trouble sleeping when I started Paleo and was taking my D3 at night before bed. Was nervous and couldn&#8217;t seem to settle down. No problems since I went to morning, I have them with my fish oil right after breakfast.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the time you read this there will probably be more evidence.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have irregularly taken 1000 UI  in the morning for years with no noticeable effect.</p>
<p>For about two years, I have had poor sleeping patterns characterized mostly by the fact that I tend to go to bed at 1am or later (and I get up around 7:15 am [woken up by an alarm clock]). Whenever I would try to go to bed earlier, I would simply fail to fall asleep.</p>
<p>After reading this blog, I increased my intake of D3 to 4-5,000 IU. I’m now falling asleep about an hour earlier. This could be a placebo effect, of course, but I consider it a very significant improvement.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether I have more energy. I don’t know how to measure such an effect. I expect that I’m less irritable, but that’s a side-effect of getting more sleep.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m on 1000 [IU] a day D3 in the morning. I have not noticed any difference in sleep, but my rosacea has cleared up considerably.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rosacea is not usually believed to be due to Vitamin D3 deficiency. For example, Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosacea">lists many causes</a>, but not that. <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/rosacea/page2.htm#2whatcauses">Here</a> is another list of causes that does not include Vitamin D3 deficiency. <a href="http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/health-conditions/skin-disorders/rosacea/">The Vitamin D Council says </a>Vitamin D &#8220;cannot be used to prevent or treat rosacea&#8221; (but without supporting evidence). On the other hand, when people with rosacea consider the question, <a href="http://www.rosaceagroup.org/The_Rosacea_Forum/showthread.php?18193-Vitamin-D3-and-Rosacea">they find evidence that D3 helps rosacea</a>. If you have rosacea and have tried D3, please comment or email me about what happened.</p>
<p>I asked Bob H for details.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>47 year old, white, IT worker, 230 lbs, runner, beer drinker, Maryland, but I lived in the Netherlands from Jun-2008-Jul-2011.</p>
<p><strong>When did you start taking 1000 IU/day D3 in the morning? Were you taking D3 before this?</strong></p>
<p>I started taking it about 6-8 weeks ago, in the morning, about 9:00 am 1000 IU &#8211; my first time for D3.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe your rosacea before you started 1000/day D3 in the morning. please describe your rosacea now.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had consistent rosacea for years on my chest. It has not gone away completely, but it&#8217;s much better.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe your sleep.</strong></p>
<p>My sleep was good before I started taking D3, and is still good.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the success stories about Vitamin D3 in the morning have involved 4000 IU/day or more. Why did you decide to try 1000 IU/day?</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to start out at a lower dose and build up.</p>
<p><strong>What brand and form of D3 do you take?</strong></p>
<p>1000 IU NatureMade gel.</p>

					<p>David Cramer left <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/02/03/vitamin-d3-and-sleep-story-11/#comment-949098">the following comment</a> here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since you started posting these, I’ve been taking D3 in the mornings and notice that I wake up much more easily. I started with just 400 IU, then increased it to 800 IU. One day I took 1200 IU and woke up at 4:00 AM the next day. I’ve gone back to 800 IU since 4:00 AM seems a bit early. For the past week, I’ve also been giving one of my daughters (11 years old) 400 IU each morning, and she seems easier to wake up in the morning (normally it’s quite difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him for details.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m in my 40s and live in Austin, Texas and have two daughters. I first encountered your work when I read about the SLD in Levitt and Dubner&#8217;s blog. I read the pdf of your papers linked from that blog post and tried the SLD with sugar water. At the time, I was at the high end of my ideal weight, but was not motivated by weight as much as curiosity. I found the irony and absurdity of the SLD appealing. I also liked the idea that it could be tested easily and cheaply. I went from ~170 to ~145 lb in couple of months, but really only did SLD for ~3 weeks. I now occasionally have a nose clipped green smoothie in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been taking D3 in the morning? What time do you take it?</strong></p>
<p>I started a couple of weeks ago after you started blogging about it. I take it around 7:00 AM. That would normally be about an hours after I wake up.</p>
<p><strong>The most obvious change since you started taking it is that you wake up more easily? How soon did this start after you started the D3?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the change I notice. It may be improving my sleep quality, but that&#8217;s very subjective and not something I track closely anyway. The effect started almost immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Could you describe (a) how easy it was to wake up in the month before you started the D3 and (b) how easy it was to wake up after you started the D3?</strong></p>
<p>I would often set three alarms on my cell phone and return to bed formore sleep after dismissing the first two. After D3, I usually wake up before my alarm and don&#8217;t feel the need to go back to sleep (e.g. after going to the bathroom). Post-D3, when I wake up, I&#8217;m awake. Previously, I was still very drowsy for some time, even after getting up.</p>
<p><strong>What time do you usually wake up? get out of bed? do you use an alarm clock to wake yourself in the morning?</strong></p>
<p>Usually 6 or 6:30. Occasionally a little earlier if I have an early meeting at work.</p>
<p><strong>Did D3 have any effect on how easily you fall asleep in the evening? On how often you wake up in the middle of the night?</strong></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t noticed any difference in falling asleep. I don&#8217;t typically wake up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>How much sunlight do you get on a typical morning?</strong></p>
<p>Although I live in Texas, I doubt I get much in the morning this time of year. I do bike to work a couple of times a week, but my arms and legs would be covered. I might even wear gloves if it&#8217;s cold. I work inside in an office during the day.</p>
<p><strong>What brand of D3 do you use? what form (e.g., gelcap)?</strong></p>
<p>NOW gelcaps.</p>
<p><strong>How can you tell your daughter &#8220;seems to find it easier to wake up in the morning&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>She&#8217;s a sound sleeper. Normally it requires repeated reminders and threats to get her up. Even after you get her out of bed, she&#8217;ll fall back asleep on the couch. With 400 IU, I&#8217;m noticing less of that. I plan to up to 800 IU this week to see if there&#8217;s a difference.</p>

<blockquote><p>After the morning D3 entries started to appear here sometime before Christmas, I switched to taking my D3 first thing in the morning too (between 4-7000 IU) and so far I’ve noticed significantly increased feelings of sleepiness at bedtime, with moderate improvement falling asleep, reduced wakings throughout the night, and much better ability to sleep in.</p></blockquote>

					<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/26/vitamin-d3-at-7-am-4000-iu-better-than-2000-iu-story-8/">an earlier post</a>, Alexandra Carmichael of <a href="http://curetogether.com/">CureTogether</a> noted that 4000 IU/day Vitamin D3 gave her better results than 2000 IU/day. Her mood was better and her sleep was better. But she&#8217;d only taken the larger dose once.</p>
<p>She recently sent me an update:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since I last wrote to you [8 days earlier], I&#8217;ve been taking 4000-6000 IU Vitamin D3, and I can report that it&#8217;s NOT having a positive effect on my sleep, but it is balancing my mood significantly, helping me to handle normally overwhelming situations with much more ease, and avoiding mood extremes. This is a wonderful thing!</p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted to let you know I don&#8217;t fit the sleep-improvement set &#8212; I still wake up super easily in the night. Falling asleep is easy, but I attribute that to the blue blocker glasses. Also, 4000 IU is much better at balancing my mood than 2000 IU (no noticeable effect) or 6000 IU (feelings of intensity or overwhelm increase).</p></blockquote>

					<p>Greg Harrington left a comment on <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/24/vitamin-d3-first-thing-in-morning-improves-falling-asleep/">an earlier post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have had very similar results [fall asleep more easily] from first-thing in morning D3.(NOTE: I have great flexibility in my schedule &#8212; I can sleep/awake whenever I want &#8212; so I have been most focused on “restful” sleeping.) Differences: (a) My pre-D3 issue was restless sleep (waking up frequently), not failure to fall asleep. (b) The effect of sleeping all the way through the night was definitely immediate–very first night. (c) Also, most days I also wake up feeling more “rejuvenated”. This is not 100% though.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him for details.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lived Austin,TX since 07/2011. Kansas City, MO before that. I&#8217;m a software programmer. 6&#8242; 3&#8243;. 210 lbs. (White male, mostly German, but completely European descent.)</p>
<p><strong>How did you want to improve your sleep?</strong></p>
<p>I want to sleep through the night without waking up 3-6 times in a 6-9 hour sleep. This problem has lasted for 2-3 years. It sort of crept up on me. I go to sleep between midnight and 2 am. </p>
<p><strong>How much D3 do you take? At what time?</strong></p>
<p>I take 50,000 IU between 8 and 9 am. If I forget or wake up later, I don&#8217;t take it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0F2B2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=harrslife-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B000A0F2B2">This</a> is the product I take: Bio-Tech D3 in 50,000 IU capsules.</p>
<p>Why 50k? It was available on Amazon, and I calculated that to be what you&#8217;d get from 75-90 minutes of full-body sunlight. Thinking about Paleo lifestyle&#8230;that seemed reasonable. This is a LOT more than most SE people are taking but I wanted to maximize the effect! <img src='http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Any effects of D3 on something other than sleep? </p>
<p>I often waking up feeling more rested/rejuvenated. But not every day. I tend to feel tired between 11 pm and midnight. </p>
<p></strong><strong>What happened when you started taking D3 in the morning?</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>As a counterpoint [to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/26/vitamin-d3-at-7-am-4000-iu-better-than-2000-iu/">this post</a>], I’ve been taking 4-5,000 IU of D3 for a couple of months now, and while it <em>might</em> be making me feel better in other ways (more vital, upbeat, and energetic), it has coincided with a stretch of poor sleep. I have what they (hilariously) call “terminal insomnia” &#8212; that is, I usually have no trouble at all falling asleep, but I wake regularly at night and am permanently awake very early, often from 4:30am onwards. This has been a periodic problem for a few years now, though this stretch is notably tolerable, for some reason.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Blood tests last year [2011] showed I had low Vitamin D levels so I was put on a 50,000 IU once/week regimen for 3 months using a prescription D2 (ergocalciferol). A recheck after 3 months showed my level had hardly changed. A search of PubMed showed conflicting views on using the D2 form. So for the next 3 months I used ProHealth D3 Extreme 50,000 IU (via Amazon.com) instead of another D2 scrip my doc had given me. I always took the D2 or D3 in the morning (just lucky happenstance.)</p>
<p>The second recheck, after the second 3 mo., showed my Vitamin D level was normal. I hadn’t put it all together until seeing this post, but when using the D3 I had the same effect [as what is described in <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/24/vitamin-d3-first-thing-in-morning-improves-falling-asleep/">this post</a>] &#8212; when I got tired, I got *really* tired right at bedtime, and slept like a rock.</p>
<p>Even though it has been less than a month since stopping the weekly dose, I have noticed my sleep degrading somewhat, and lately not even being tired when I should.</p></blockquote>

					<p>Jenny West, the Englishwoman <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/28/vitamin-d3-first-thing-in-morning-still-more-experience/?preview=true">who discovered independently the value of taking Vitamin D3 in the morning</a>, wrote again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since reading some of the other D3 stories, I increased my D3 [morning] dosage to 5000 IU/day [from 3000 IU/day] two days ago.</p>
<p>1. I immediately slept even better – no longer being aware of mid-sleep turning-over.</p>
<p>2. I’ve had a large boost of energy and the clarity of thought that both <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/27/vitamin-d3-first-thing-in-morning-more-experience/">Robin Barooah</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/26/vitamin-d3-at-7-am-4000-iu-better-than-2000-iu/">Alexandra Carmichael</a> mentioned.</p>
<p>3. A year-long injury – specifically a dislocated coccyx – has suddenly taken a step forward, and I found myself running for the  Tube last night – something I can’t remember when I last did it. Is this a direct effect of the D3, or an indirect one resulting from much better sleep?</p></blockquote>
<p>This agrees with what both Alexandra and I experienced: a dose of 4000 IU worked much better than a dose of 2000 IU.</p>

					<p>Alex Chernavsky, who has <a href="http://www.astrocyte-design.com/shangri-la-diet/index.html">used the Shangri-La Diet successfully for two years</a>, recently <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/24/vitamin-d3-first-thing-in-morning-improves-falling-asleep/#comment-947481">commented</a> as follows (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p>For what it’s worth, I’ve taken Vitamin D at different times of the day, and <strong>I’ve never noticed any effect on my sleep</strong>. Of course, my sleep is already pretty good, in the sense that I fall asleep quickly and don’t usually wake up during the night. (My sleep is <em>not good</em> in the sense that I don’t get enough of it.)</p></blockquote>
<p>By email, I learned that Alex is now taking Vitamin D3 &#8212; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042DDP44/">this particular product</a>, which is vegan (&#8220;plant-source&#8221;) &#8212; at 5000 IU every other day. On weekdays, he takes it at about 8:00 am, on weekends, 9:30-10:00 am.</p>
<p>What might explain Alex&#8217;s failure to notice better sleep?</p>
<p>1. Not enough D3. I found that 2000 IU/day had no noticeable effect, whereas 4000 IU/day did produce noticeable benefit. Alex is getting 2500 IU/day &#8212; or less, if he takes it too late on the weekends.</p>
<p>2. His source of D3.</p>
<p>3. Individual differences large enough to matter. If you do sensitive psychology experiments, you will learn there are individual differences in everything.</p>
<p>4. Ceiling effect. Alex&#8217;s sleep is too good to notice improvement.</p>
<p>Those are the just the obvious possibilities.</p>

					<p>I have heard many stories about Vitamin D3 and sleep, often in the comments section of this blog. From now on I am going to number them. (I retitled earlier posts.)</p>
<p>Elizabeth Funderburk emailed me:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve always suffered, rather lightly I guess, from SAD in the winter.  In 2010 I started eating primal, which I thought would help &#8211; it helped in many ways but I still got gloomier all winter and didn&#8217;t even realize it til that first warm sunny spring day when I &#8220;woke up.&#8221; <a href="../2011/11/02/it-matters-when-you-take-vitamin-d-a-stunning-discovery/">Your November post about D3</a> reminded me that I wanted to try it this winter, so I got a bottle and started taking it in the morning. I forgot a few times and took it in the midday or afternoon, and yes, I felt noticeably more spazzy and awake those evenings. Now, if I forget, I just skip it if I remember later than 10 am. I do think I sleep better. I take 4000-6000 IU daily.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked her for details.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>I live in Reno, NV, USA, and I&#8217;m 34.  I do home renovations.</p>
<p><strong>What brand?</strong></p>
<p>Kirkland D3 2000 IU gelcaps. The first bottle I got was from Walgreen&#8217;s, so I guess it was Nature&#8217;s Bounty gelcaps. Both seem to work equally well. I have not tried capsules. I take the D3 while I&#8217;m waiting for my coffee, usually 6 or 7 am.</p>

					<p>A woman named Jenny West, who lives in Chiltern Hills (west of London), <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/16/vitamin-d3-more-reason-to-take-it-first-thing-in-the-morning/#comment-946262">commented</a> that  she &#8220;discovered independently that D3 first thing in the morning works.&#8221; I asked her for details:</p>
<blockquote><p>I (and my family) started to take Vitamin D3 because we are all dyslexic/dyspraxic and had Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD, a type of depression). Previously we had tried using light boxes (minimal effect), getting out every lunchtime (more useful) and finally 5HTp &#8212; which works but is expensive and if you start it once you are in SAD you can end up ‘wired’. Our SAD symptoms were mainly sleepiness and lack of energy (= hibernation), and brain fog (= difficulty concentrating).</p>
<p>We started taking D3 (2000 IU, Solgar) in gelcaps. That first winter, for the first time ever, no one had any seasonal affective disorder. I had had it since the age of 21, my youngest child when only 4 yrs old, and my other two children by the time they were 18 yrs old. At this point, we were taking the D3 at random times, commonly lunchtime or later, often when everyone was together and the vitamin pot was handed around!</p>
<p>This autumn, all the youngsters had moved out. I found I was forgetting the D3, so I moved it to the bathroom and started taking it first thing in the morning (8-9 am). Then in September, I started taking 3000 IU (instead of 2000 IU). We&#8217;d been in Greece and had come back to a gloomy autumn and I wanted to make sure SAD didn&#8217;t kick in. In a month I started sleeping through the night most nights.</p>
<p>Before I started taking D3 first thing in the morning, I only slept through 10% of my nights, and had been doing so for at least 15 years. I would wake at 3-4 am, but didn&#8217;t get up unless I had been awake for more than 3/4 hr. Then I would be awake until 6 am. Now I sleep without a break (other than turning over) from midnight to 8 am. I sleep like this 95% of my nights, and that includes the odd night when I took the D3 much later in the morning because I had slept in – and consequently woke the following night.</p>
<p>As a coeliac, I take the supplements many coeliacs take – probiotics, minerals, vitamins – but none of these affected my sleep either way. So it really looks as if it is the timing plus the correct dose of D3.</p>
<p>BTW the extra daytime energy is fantastic.</p></blockquote>
<p>She is 5 feet 4 inches, 64 kg. Notice that 2000 IU first thing in the morning did not improve her sleep but 3000 IU first thing in the morning did. I had a similar experience: 2000 IU had no clear effect  but 4000 IU did.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I know <a href="http://www.sublime.org/">Robin Barooah</a> from Quantified Self meetups. When I learned he had started taking Vitamin D3 early in the morning, I asked him what happened:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been taking it since December 20. I initially thought of trying it immediately on my return from London because I thought that it might help to reduce jet lag, given its apparent coupling with the circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t seem to have a dramatic effect on my jet lag &#8211; which was as bad as I usually experience it for about the same number of days (around 3-4). However <strong>it had a very pronounced effect on my general energy levels</strong>. <strong>At first I was almost hyperactive, yet my concentration was good.</strong> I was using 5000 IU per day, at 7:30 am. The hyperactive feeling subsided but the dramatic improvement of my energy levels (and increased concentration) continued until I decided to reduce the dose to 2000 or 3000 IU per day [from 5000 IU/day]. My mood has improved too, although I think indirectly though feeling more capable and productive.</p>
<p>I decided to reduce the dose because I was concerned that my sleep wasn&#8217;t noticeably better than before taking the D3, and might have been worse.   <strong>Reducing the dose caused a huge reduction in my energy levels and concentration</strong>, and no improvement in sleep. After a week of that I went back to the 5000 IU dose, and again am very happy with the effects. The improvement in sustained concentration is so dramatic that it&#8217;s disturbing to think of how much this could have changed my life had I been using it for years (assuming the effect lasts).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that my sleep <em>quality</em> has improved in some way that isn&#8217;t reflected in my subjective experience of sleeping, and this has caused the improved energy and concentration. I am sleeping about the same length of time, and waking up in the night just as often and feeling about as rested as before I started (which is not quite as rested as I&#8217;d like to feel, despite having a lot of energy). I am not taking a multivitamin, so it&#8217;s also possible that I&#8217;m not getting all of the possible benefit.</p>
<p>Without doubt, this is one of the most effective things I&#8217;ve ever tried.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added. He takes Now Foods Vitamin D3 (easy to buy on Amazon), the 5000 IU and 1000 IU softgels. He also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I used to get quite severe tiredness (enough to need to lie down) at numerous times during the day. Now I seem to get tired just a little in the afternoon, and then progressively so into the evening. There&#8217;s a very distinct slowdown in my energy that happens very obviously around 5pm, which is coincidentally around dusk here at the moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have noticed something similar. Before Vitamin D3 early in the morning, I used to get really tired around 10 am. Enough to make me lie down. This happened on more than half of all days. Now that I am taking a lot of D3 (8000 or 10000 IU) first thing in the morning (8 or 9 am) it doesn&#8217;t happen at all. (I may eventually go down to a lower dose, such as 5000 IU/day.)</p>

					<p>On a status update, Alexandra Carmichael (of <a href="http://curetogether.com/">CureTogether</a>) noted she was taking 4000 IU of Vitamin D3. I asked her for details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been taking 2000 IU of D3 every morning for many months, but after hearing about your Meetup talk topic from Gary/Ernesto ["Vitamin D3 and Sleep"] and talking to [redacted] about his experience with it, I decided to switch to 4000 IU, starting yesterday. I take it between 6 and 7 am, with my other morning supplements/meds.</p>
<p>Yesterday I noticed an unusual sense of &#8220;clear and smooth&#8221; mood for much of the day, which is very odd for me. The day after a meetup, I usually experience intensely fluctuating moods (I&#8217;ve been tracking hourly moods, and on my worst days, it&#8217;s a 3-hour cycle between peaks, like a super rapid cycling, ultradian bipolar &#8211; my therapist suggested this term when I showed him my mood tracking data.)</p>
<p>I also slept unusually well &#8211; I&#8217;ve been having a good deal of trouble sleeping lately, both falling asleep and night waking. Last night I slept a solid 8 hours!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a very small sample (one day) of what happens with 4000 IU. However, Alexandra&#8217;s experience is similar to mine. I found that 2000 IU of D3 had no clear effect compared to nothing. However, the very first night after I upped the dose to 4000 IU (from 2000 IU) my sleep was noticeably better. </p>
<p>Alex is using Nature&#8217;s Bounty 2000 IU Vitamin D3 gelcaps.</p>

					<p>I have been getting good sleep improvement from Vitamin D3 (early in the morning) using tablets. However, Tara Grant and Paul have gotten good results with gelcaps. Apparently both formulations work. Which is better? </p>
<p>This story, from a woman I&#8217;ll call JMW, suggests gelcaps are better:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Sorting out all the nutrition for [celiac disease], about 3 years ago, [my two boys and I] started taking D3 &#8211; 2000 IU of Solgar in capsule form. That first winter, NO ONE had seasonal affective disorder [= depression]. I had had it since I was 21, can&#8217;t remember further back than that, the youngest had had it since he was 4 yrs old, can&#8217;t remember the others. </p>
<p>We unintentionally proved it needs to be in capsules (i.e. oil) rather than tablets when I mistakenly repeat-ordered with tablets, and everyone got worse until I got the capsules again.

					<p>I recently learned that a reader named Paul improved his sleep &#8212; he now falls asleep more easily &#8212; by taking Vitamin D3 first thing in the morning. He had previously taken the same amount of D3 at other times of day for five months with no obvious effect. Because of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/02/it-matters-when-you-take-vitamin-d-a-stunning-discovery/">my first post about D3 first thing in the morning</a>, he started to take his D3 at that time. Right then his sleep improved.</p>
<p>I asked him for details.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>I live in Jersey City, NJ. I work in advertising. I&#8217;m 39 years old, 6 foot 1 inch, and 180 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>How much D3 do you take?</strong></p>
<p>5000 IU/day.</p>
<p><strong>What time?</strong></p>
<p>Usually around 8:00 a.m., but sometimes as early as 7:15 or as late as 10:30.</p>
<p><strong>What brand, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>I take Mason softgels. Each softgel is 5000 IU, &#8220;from fish liver oil.&#8221;  Other ingredients are soybean oil, gelatin, glycerin, and purified water.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me more about what happened?</strong></p>
<p>Before taking D3 first thing in the morning, I was having trouble getting to sleep quite often:  I&#8217;d say 3 times a week on average.  I would just feel wound up for no apparent reason.  I would toss and turn, usually till 1:00 or 2:00 but sometimes until the sun came up.  (It&#8217;s possible this was caused by taking D3 in the evening, which I sometimes did.  But this had happened to some extent for as long as I can remember, going back to my childhood.)  I read your blog post this past November 2 about &#8220;Primal Girl&#8221;&#8216;s experience with D3, and began taking it right after getting up.  Right away (I don&#8217;t remember whether it was the first night or not, but it couldn&#8217;t have taken more than 2 days because it felt immediate), I started getting tired right around 11:00 or 11:30, which is when I ought to be falling asleep.</p>
<p>Not just &#8220;tired,&#8221; though&#8212;extremely tired.  So tired that if I didn&#8217;t get to bed I&#8217;d fall asleep on the spot.  It took me by surprise at first, so that I had to struggle to stay awake while I took out my contact lenses and brushed my teeth.  When I went to bed I was out like a light.  This continued through most of December.</p>
<p>Over the holidays I went out of town for 8 days and wasn&#8217;t taking D3.  By the end of my vacation I was having insomnia again.  When I got home, I forgot to start taking it again right away and noticed that I was not getting tired like I had been last Fall.  I started taking D3 again around the 4th or 5th of January with the same result as previously.  I continue to take it and experience the same result.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum by Seth</strong>. One reason this story is interesting is that it supports the idea that Vitamin D3 acts like sunlight &#8212; which is different than acting like a stimulant (e.g., caffeine). A stimulant will push you toward being  awake a few hours after you ingest it. Sunlight, on the other hand, will push you toward being awake a few hours after you are exposed to it <strong>and</strong> push you toward sleep a dozen hours after that.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In November, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/02/it-matters-when-you-take-vitamin-d-a-stunning-discovery/">I wrote about Tara Grant (aka Primal Girl)&#8217;s discovery</a> that taking Vitamin D first thing in the morning rather than later improved her sleep. Then several people commented that they had observed something similar &#8212; some in response to my post (my post led them to try it), some independently. Perhaps people who tested her observation and found it <strong>wasn&#8217;t</strong> true didn&#8217;t comment.</p>
<p>One way to assess this possibility is to ask people who have tried it what happened. In the comments to one of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/">my posts about this</a>, Tyler Tyssedal <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/12/13/vitamin-d3-and-sleep-update/#comment-939106">said he would try it</a>. A few days ago I asked him what had happened. Here&#8217;s his reply (shortened):</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been tweaking the timing of my Vitamin D3 intake since I made that comment [on December 13 -- one month ago]. I have also made a few other life changes (such as supplements), so the changes I&#8217;ve experienced cannot be attributed only to Vitamin D3 (5000 IU) timing. <strong>But yes, taking D3 first thing in the morning instead of later noticeably improved my sleep quality.</strong> I have been experiencing perpetual, involuntary biphasic sleep on and off for years. I would go to bed around 11 and wake up every day between 4 and 6 am, conscious enough to check the time and sigh. <strong>I had been taking my D3 with lunch or dinner, sometimes never</strong>.<strong> I changed my D3 intake to first thing in the morning. Within a week I noticed I would wake up two out of three nights, around 6 (so a little later), a marked improvement</strong>.</p>
<p>I am a 6&#8217;2&#8243;, 160-lb male. I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Desk job, lift 2-3 times per week, 45 min-1 hr per session with 15 min walking to and from gym.  I typically eat two meals a day (1-2 pm and 6-8 pm). In the morning (between 7:30 and 10am) I consume about 20-30 oz of coffee with 1-3 T cream. I also eat 1 T coconut oil with my coffee and 1 T of it with my dinner.</p>
<p>When I changed my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Solgar-Magnesium-Citrate-120-Tablets/dp/B00013Z0ZG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326742457&amp;sr=8-4" target="_blank">400 mg magnesium citrate supplement</a> to early afternoon rather than right before bed, I experienced even better sleep. After all these changes, I no longer wake up in the middle of the night. I sleep straight through. A week and a half ago I started taking ALA and NALC with my D3, coconut oil and coffee in the morning. The results have been fantastic and I feel a strong clear headedness in the morning.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary:</p>
<div>
<p><strong>WAKE (7:30-9:30am)</strong>: 5000 IU D3, 500 mg acetyl l-carnitine, 250 mg alpha lipoic acid, 1 T coconut oil, 20-30 oz coffee, 1-3 T cream.</p>
<p><strong>LUNCH (12-2pm)</strong>: 30% food for the day, typically lowish carb, 400 mg magnesium citrate, 1.2 g EPA/DHA fish oil (on days I don&#8217;t consume sardines or salmon, which is 2-3 days a week), Vitamin K2 (1000 K2 MK4, 1000 K2 MK7).</p>
<p><strong>DINNER &amp; POST DINNER</strong>: Rest of food (100-150 g carbs post workout workout days; 50-100 g non workout days). On restless nights, 2-5 mg melatonin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been pleased with 2-5 mg melatonin before bed on days when I am not heavy eyed by 9:30 pm. I have taken melatonin on and off for years and would still experience biphasic sleep, with or without it.</p>
