				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">The honey</a> has been the biggest improvement in  my life in several years. It&#8217;s not just the energy, I think I&#8217;m more motivated to do things.</p>
<p>I started the honey with 1 tablespoon, but like others who commented, I had some trouble getting to sleep, so I reduced the dose to about 2 teaspoons. I take the honey about 15 minutes before bedtime, and I have not missed a dose since starting.</p>
<p>The first morning after the honey I felt much more alert and rested. I had no trouble getting out of bed even on 5 hours sleep at around 6:30 – 7:00 AM PDT.</p>
<p>The motivation that has come since starting the honey doesn’t feel primarily psychological. It doesn’t wax and wane or change in response to events. It feels raw (no pun intended), more like a drive.</p>
<p>The motivation improvement (that might be due to honey) seemed to begin a few weeks after I started it. The main aspect of the motivation is that I feel impelled to do things. This feeling lasts all day. It&#8217;s not a manic feeling, because I still have priorities, and I can bail out of a task if I&#8217;m not making progress.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I noticed a similar change. After I started the bedtime honey, it became easier to do everything. Not a big change, but noticeable. When it started is hard to say. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stuart King writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was very hungry today at dinner and the thought of sweet food wasn&#8217;t appealing at all, but after filling up on some rice, chicken and coconut cream curry I immediately had ice cream and chocolate slice [= what Americans call a brownie], which had had no appeal 15 minutes or so before!</p></blockquote>
<p>An everyday observation that anyone can make. Studies have shown what Stuart noticed: When you are hungry sweet foods are unappealing. This is why dessert is eaten after the rest of the meal.</p>
<p>The main way that psychologists explain an experimental effect &#8212; choose between explanations &#8212; is by finding out what makes the effect larger or smaller. For example, discovery of what makes learning more or less (what increases or decreases the effect of one learning trial) is the main way psychologists have chosen among different theories of learning. Different theories predict different interactions.</p>
<p>Why do we like sweet foods? The usual answers are that sweet foods are a &#8220;good source of energy&#8221; and they provide &#8220;quick energy&#8221;. But these explanations do nothing to explain what Stuart noticed. If sugar is a good (= better than average) source of energy, we should eat it <em>before</em> other foods (average sources of energy) when we are hungry (hunger signals lack of energy). The opposite is true. You may not want to call it a &#8220;contradiction&#8221; but there is no doubt the conventional view does not explain what Stuart noticed. Of course many nutrition experts, such as Weston Price, are/were entirely sure sugar is unhealthy.</p>
<p>As a tool for choosing among theories, Stuart&#8217;s observation is especially good because (a) it is very large (sweets go from unappealing to appealing) and (b) paradoxical (eating calories should make all calorie sources less appealing).</p>
<p>If you have been reading this blog, you know I explain Stuart&#8217;s observation by assuming that we need sugar in the evening to sleep well. Sugar (sucrose, fructose, glucose) eaten in the evening increases blood glucose, which increases glycogen. During sleep, glycogen becomes glucose, which the brain needs to work properly. Evolution shaped us to like sweet foods after a meal so that we will eat them closer to when we sleep. (The value of replenishing glycogen close to bedtime also explains why <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/03/16/the-wisdom-of-google-dessert-honey-and-fruit-closer-to-dinner-than-breakfast-or-lunch/" target="_blank">we eat sweet foods after dinner more than after breakfast or lunch</a>.)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of another case where what experts say is so out of line with what&#8217;s easily observed. For example, I&#8217;m sure cholesterol doesn&#8217;t cause heart disease, but there is no everyday observation that supports my belief.</p>

<p>If sugar is helpful for sleep, why is it <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0057873" target="_blank">associated with diabetes</a>? My guess is that sugar is almost always consumed in foods that taste exactly the same each time &#8212; what in <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em> I called <em>ditto foods</em>. For example, soft drinks. Ditto foods with sugar, because they have a strong precise CS (smell) and a strong fast US (calorie signal), produce an especially strong smell-calorie association. Such an association raises the body fat set point, thus causing obesity. Obesity causes diabetes. It&#8217;s also possible that eating sugar during the day &#8212; at the wrong time &#8212; hurts sleep. Maybe sugar during the day raises insulin and thus reduces the conversion of sugar to glycogen. Less glycogen causes bad sleep, bad sleep causes diabetes. My blood sugar levels clearly improved when I started eating sweets in the evening &#8212; opposite to what the sugar-diabetes link would predict.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">blogged many times</a> that bedtime honey improves sleep. I learned this from <a href="http://stuartkingmusic.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Stuart King</a>, an Australian musician. He also pointed out we eat dessert with dinner more than with other meals. which others who have described the honey effect <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/02/interview-with-mike-mcinnes-author-of-the-honey-diet/" target="_blank">have not said</a>. The dessert observation suggests that other sweets, not just honey, improve sleep. After I repeated the dessert observation, a friend said I of all people should know it isn&#8217;t universal. The Chinese don&#8217;t eat dessert, she said. Yes, I said, but where I lived in Beijing there seemed to be lots of sweets eaten in the evening, and lots of street vendors selling fruit in the evening.<span id="more-13234"></span></p>
<p>The honey-sleep connection helped me improve my sleep in other ways. I found my sleep got better if in addition to bedtime honey I ate fruit (e.g., banana) an hour or so before bedtime.  My sleep got even better if I ate something sweet, such as Yakult, an hour or so before that. Both observations implied that honey improved sleep because of the sugar. Nowadays I usually eat three sets of sweets: soon after dinner, mid-evening, and bedtime. I sleep very well every single night, better than ever before. These findings make sense if glycogen (stored glucose) is very important for sleep. My way of eating (three sets of sweets slightly spread out) may produce more glycogen at bedtime than similar ways of eating (e.g., eating the same sweets spread throughout the day).</p>
<p>Recently I realized that Stuart&#8217;s observation about dinner and dessert made a prediction: the word <em>dessert</em> should be better associated with the word <em>dinner</em> than the words <em>breakfast </em>and <em>lunch</em>. (A lot of talking/writing consists of describing reality.) I used Google to test this prediction. I counted the hits returned when I searched &#8220;dessert dinner&#8221;, &#8220;dessert breakfast&#8221;, and &#8220;dessert lunch&#8221;. The prediction turned out to be true: &#8220;dessert dinner&#8221; had a lot more hits than the other two combinations, even though <em>breakfast</em>, <em>lunch </em>and <em>dinner</em> are almost equally common.</p>
<p>I checked about forty other food words: Were they more associated with one meal than others? I found several interesting things.</p>
<p>1. It wasn&#8217;t just <em>dessert</em>. <em>Honey</em> and <em>fruit</em> were associated with <em>dinner</em> more than <em>breakfast</em> or <em>lunch</em>. The size of the association was very similar in the three cases. For almost all other food words I tested there was little or no association.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-15-google-food-basic-effect.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13241" alt="2014-03-15 google food basic effect" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-15-google-food-basic-effect-591x300.jpeg" width="591" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Here are examples of little or no association.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-15-google-food-no-effect.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13248" alt="2014-03-15 google food no effect" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-15-google-food-no-effect-591x300.jpeg" width="591" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>2. There were some surprising associations, shown here.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-15-google-food-surprises.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13245" alt="2014-03-15 google food surprises" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-15-google-food-surprises-591x300.jpeg" width="591" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>No surprise that <em>tea</em> is associated with <em>breakfast</em> but why is <em>potato </em>associated with <em>lunch</em>? French fries? Why is <em>nuts</em> associated with <em>dinner</em>? Do nuts contain something that improves sleep?</p>
<p>For each food I computed a &#8220;dinner effect&#8221; meaning the log(dinner count) minus the average of log(breakfast count) and log(lunch count). Here is a kind of histogram of those values.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-15-google-food-histogram.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13252" alt="2014-03-15 google food histogram" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-03-15-google-food-histogram-591x300.jpeg" width="591" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The outlier status of nuts, fruit, honey and dessert is clear.</p>
<p>These findings support (a) the original idea (because the original idea led to them), (b) the importance of the original idea (because the association is so clear) and (c) use of Google to learn what people do. Word associations are influenced by many things, no doubt; these results suggest actual behavior is a strong influence. Use of Google to study behavior is free, public, fast, and convenient.</p>
<p>I was surprised the results were so clear. I suspect the explanation is that sweets taste better closer to bedtime. Dessert, honey and fruit differ in many ways; the similarity of size of association suggests that the association is due to what they share (sugar).</p>
<p>I hereby give you permission to eat dessert with dinner.</p>

At the 2012 Ancestral Health Symposium, in Los Angeles, Rob Wolf said something similar about the centrality of sleep: &#8220;If a person sleeps well, you can&#8217;t kill them. If they sleep badly, you can&#8217;t keep them alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mainstream health researchers, on the other hand, haven&#8217;t figured this out. James Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, in <a href="http://rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/1/120144.full" target="_blank">a recent paper</a> about how to fight cancer, wrote this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Long known has been PERIOD 2 (PER2) involvement as a clock protein at the heart of the circadian rhythms of higher animal cells. Later, <strong>quite unexpectedly</strong> [emphasis added], PER2 was found to function as a tumour suppressor, with the absence of both its copies causing the rate of radiation-induced cancers to rise.</p></blockquote>
<p>When PER2 is absent, circadian rhythms disappear and sleep becomes very fragmented, spread out over the whole day. When you sleep better (which usually means more deeply), your immune system works better band does a better job of suppressing tumors. There is plenty of other supporting evidence. For example, in 2012 <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/sleep-apnea-tied-to-increased-cancer-risk/" target="_blank">two studies found sleep apnea associated with higher cancer rates</a>. The PER2 evidence is especially good at establishing cause and effect.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/sleep-apnea-tied-to-increased-cancer-risk/" target="_blank">two studies</a> found that people with sleep apnea have a much higher rate of cancer than people without it, even controlling for several cancer-related variables. In one study, the increase in risk was five-fold. These studies raised several questions: 1. Were the associations due to chance? 2. If real, did the associations reflect cause and effect? Surely people with sleep apnea are different in several ways from people without it. 3. If the associations did reflect cause and effect, which of the many effects of sleep apnea was/were responsible?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/poor-quality-sleep-ups-cancer-growth-risk-fragmented-sleep-weakens-immunity-and-helps-tumors-grow" target="_blank">A new study</a> found that rats woken up frequently got more cancer. This is a correct prediction from the idea that bad sleep increases cancer, increasing the plausibility of that idea.</p>
<blockquote><p>[The study] used mice, housed in small groups. During the day—when mice normally sleep—a quiet, motorized brush moved through half of the cages every two minutes, forcing those mice to wake up and then go back to sleep. The rest of the mice were not disturbed. After seven days in this setting, both groups of mice were injected with cells from one of two tumor types (TC-1 or 3LLC). All mice developed palpable tumors within 9 to 12 days. Four weeks after inoculation the researchers evaluated the tumors. Tumors from mice with fragmented sleep were twice as large, for both tumor types, as those from mice that had slept normally. A follow-up experiment found that when tumor cells were implanted in the thigh muscle, which should help contain growth, the tumors were much more aggressive and invaded surrounding tissues in mice with disrupted sleep.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VrsQMK4o3vEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><em>Great Sleep! Reduced Cancer!</em></a> is a whole book (98 pp) about the connection between sleep and cancer.</p>
<p>Epidemiologists haven&#8217;t yet figured out that they should always measure sleep  quality, just as they always measure cigarette smoking and body weight, but at least <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/6/1431.full" target="_blank">interest is growing</a>.  Both short and long sleep <a href="http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/12/1484.short" target="_blank">are associated with a higher risk of heart disease</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/18/5/1468.long" target="_blank">A 2009 study</a> followed about 9000 men for 10-20 years. It found that strength (how much you can bench and leg press) measured at the start of the study was associated with likelihood of dying of cancer during the study. Men in the upper two-thirds of the study population in strength had 40% less cancer mortality. This might be the most surprising result:</p>
<blockquote><p>Further adjustment for BMI, percent body fat, waist circumference, or cardiorespiratory fitness had little effect on the association. The associations of BMI, percent body fat, or waist circumference with cancer mortality did not persist after further adjusting for muscular strength.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, muscle strength was a better predictor than several similar measures (BMI, etc.) and these other measures stopped predicting when corrected for muscle strength. Muscle strength is closely connected to something important.</p>
<p>Men who are stronger by and large exercise more, no doubt. Yet muscle strength is determined by resistance training, not aerobic exercise &#8212; and it is aerobic exercise (and to some extent walking) that have been promoted by countless experts since the 1960s and the invention of the concept <em>aerobic</em>. Jogging reduces how much time you have for resistance training.</p>
<p>These findings interest me because I do a lot of resistance training &#8212; stand on one leg to exhaustion several times per day &#8212; purely to sleep better. By improving something easy to measure (sleep), these data suggest I have also been improving something hard to measure (chance of dying from cancer). Not surprising, but reassuring.</p>
<p>My data also suggest two different possible reasons for the strength-cancer association. One is that men who exercise more sleep better as a result; better sleep, better immune function, less cancer. Another possibility is that strength is a marker for good sleep. Among men who do equal amounts of exercise, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/30/sleep-and-bedtime-honey-more-about-strength-improvement/" target="_blank">those who sleep better will be stronger</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several people have said that bedtime honey made them wake up too early. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/14/bedtime-honey-is-a-godsend/#comment-1168304" target="_blank">For example</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>No effect for me, worse for my wife (hours of wakefulness in the middle of the night after a few hours of sleep)</p></blockquote>
<p>The commenter said this meant it wasn&#8217;t working.</p>
<p>My view is different. To me, this experience suggests that there is something safe, cheap and practical (honey) that has a powerful and non-intuitive effect on sleep. Finding something like that is extremely hard. (Drug companies have spent billions of dollars trying to do this, with far worse results.) It isn&#8217;t easy or obvious or trivial to learn how to use that powerful force to produce improvement rather than harm (&#8220;hours of wakefulness in the middle of the night&#8221;), but I am sure it is possible.</p>
<p>My first important use of self-experimentation was in graduate school. I discovered that one of the medicines my dermatologist had prescribed for my acne wasn&#8217;t working. The notion that a prescribed medicine didn&#8217;t work is useful, but not shocking. This success was enough to launch me into self-experimentation to improve my sleep &#8212; specifically, to reduce early awakening. This turned out to be very hard.</p>
<p>After ten years of trial and error (all error), <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">I discovered something</a> that made my early awakening reliably <strong>worse</strong>. I was thrilled. After ten years, something finally made a difference, albeit in the wrong direction. It was a turning point. I did many experiments and finally figured out that any breakfast made my sleep worse. This was far more progress than finding out that a prescribed medicine didn&#8217;t work. It was progress because (a) nutrition experts usually said that breakfast was &#8220;the most important meal of the day&#8221;. My discovery flatly contradicted that. I became a lot more skeptical of experts, a view that has served me well. (b) Eliminating breakfast greatly reduced early awakening, and (c) the discovery showed that self-experimentation could do better than expert advice in surprising ways. My interesting self-experimentation began with the discovery of something that made my sleep worse.</p>
<p>I too have found that although I am sleeping much better, bedtime honey and other evening sugars have also made me wake up too early more often. I too need to learn how to better use this new knowledge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Your writing has dramatically improved my health in a number of ways,&#8221; a reader said. I asked for details. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve tried most of your health interventions. The first was SLD. Overall, I lost about 90 lbs. Roughly half of this was from a more traditional diet of eating whole foods esp. vegetables and exercise. I had plateaued until I discovered SLD and lost the rest. I added flax oil, butter and homemade kefir to my taste free meal over time. The butter helped me lose more weight. At the same calories, the saturated fat was somehow more filling. Initially the butter made me happier but that wore off after a few months. My HDLs and triglyceride levels are better than when I was training for a marathon and not eating this stuff. The flax oil has improved my gum health. I can&#8217;t really see a direct result from the kefir. I&#8217;m more eating it on faith. I skinned my knees quite badly a while ago. My wife commented on how quickly I healed. So maybe the kefir and other items are helping me heal faster.<span id="more-12861"></span></p>
<p>I tried morning faces twice over about a week without success. My job exposes me to a lot of evening fluorescent lights. I picked periods when I wouldn&#8217;t be exposed, but even if it worked, I couldn&#8217;t have maintained it over a long period.</p>
<p>Insomnia has been a long-time problem for me. One legged standing didn&#8217;t have a noticeable impact. Shifting my vitamin D3 to the morning seemed to help a bit. Bedtime honey has led to a big improvement. It&#8217;s uneven, but more often than not I&#8217;m sleeping much better. Even when I don&#8217;t sleep as well, I don&#8217;t feel as tired as I did without using honey. My mood has also improved. I&#8217;m calmer and happier. The honey seems to reinforce my circadian rhythm. I have more energy in the morning and am tired in the evening. I&#8217;m currently tracking what else I&#8217;m consuming and when to see if I can figure out how to get the benefits on the honey more consistently. My wife and friend have tried honey at bedtime and both report improvements.</p></blockquote>
<p>My view is that of the cause-effect relations I have emphasized, the most useful will be (a) the <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">effect of morning faces on mood</a> (hard to use at first), (b) the <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">effects of sweets on sleep</a> (easy), and (c) the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114619130176100669530" target="_blank">effects of foods on brain function</a>b. Bedtime honey is just the first of the sweets effects and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">flaxseed oil and butter</a> are just the first of the brain effects. Full understanding and use of the morning faces discovery lies many years in the future. Of the various methods I&#8217;ve developed, I think the most useful will be the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114619130176100669530" target="_blank">use of reaction time measurements to improve brain function</a> (and, probably, overall health). At the level of what might be called &#8220;meta-methods&#8221; (the usual name is <em>big ideas</em>), I think the most useful will be that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/" target="_blank">people who aren&#8217;t health experts can discover important things about health</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Janet Rosenbaum, a professor of epidemiology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Has anyone mentioned the connection between the honey/banana before bedtime and the advice to have an ounce of simple carbohydrate without protein before bedtime? There have been at least two books on this idea: <em>Potatoes, not Prozac</em> by Kathleen DesMaisons and <em>The Serotonin Power Diet</em> by Judith Wurtman. The first book suggests a small baked potato and bans alcohol and sugar during the day. The second book allows an ounce of any carbs such as pretzels. The proposed mechanism is that eating protein during the day, and carbs before bed without protein increases serotonin production over night, and my own experience is that it improves sleep and creates more vivid dreams.</p></blockquote>
<p>I cannot easily get the Serotonin book here in Beijing but I found <a href="http://www.radiantrecovery.com/4r.htm" target="_blank">this</a> related to the Potatoes book:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that you are having three meals a day at regular intervals, let&#8217;s add Mr. Spud to your routine. Have a potato (with its skin) every night three hours after dinner. It will help your body raise your serotonin level and make you feel more confident, competent, creative and optimistic. You can eat your potato baked, mashed, roasted, cut into oven fries or grated into hash browns. Just be sure you eat the skin. And you can top it with anything you like except foods that contain a protein. (Protein eaten along with the potato at bedtime will interfere with your serotonin-making process.) Good toppings are butter, salsa, mustard, spices, or olive oil. Toppings you should NOT use are cheese, sour cream, bacon bits, or cream of chicken soup.</p></blockquote>
<p>I found when I ate honey with cheese the sleep-improvement effect of the honey was much reduced, in agreement with what is said here about avoiding cheese.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fatassdiet.com/potatoesnotprozac.html" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s what happened</a> when one person tried this. I am quoting only the parts about sleep:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Day 1] I had the infamous potato at the recommended time. That potato really kept me up. I barely slept. What was this about her saying that a potato helps you get a good night&#8217;s sleep? But I&#8217;m willing to give it some time. I never get a good night&#8217;s sleep so it will be nice to see what that&#8217;s like again.</p>
<p>[Day 2] This night, I could not sleep at ALL. I was up till around 4 am. How can a little potato keep a person up so much?</p>
<p>[Day 3] I finally had that promised sleep that the author was talking about. WOW. I haven&#8217;t ever felt quite like this before.</p>
<p>[Day 4] A blissful night&#8217;s sleep.</p>
<p>[Day 9] Those potatoes really work on making one&#8217;s sleep much better.</p>
<p>[Day 23] I am not eating potatoes at night most of the time, which is part of the <b>PNP</b> [Potatoes Not Prozac] diet, but not something that you start from the beginning. [Nothing about sleep.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe she stopped the bedtime potato because she wanted to lose weight faster.</p>
<p>A potato near bedtime will surely increase blood glucose during sleep, supporting the idea that a better supply of blood glucose is what improves sleep.  Presumably it&#8217;s important to do this without (a) triggering too much insulin production or (b) increasing brain activity so much you wake up. Whether glycogen, in the liver or elsewhere, has anything to do with this I have no idea. Glycogen is one source of new glucose as the brain burns thru blood glucose but another is not yet digested carbohydrate in what you&#8217;ve recently eaten (e.g., potato).</p>

<p>Perhaps he&#8217;s been reading Taleb, who stresses the value of randomness. I would have been more impressed had he eaten the cake at the same time as the rest of the meal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It isn&#8217;t well known that eggs (large amounts) can cause insomnia nor that caffeine &#8212; in special cases &#8212; can reduce insomnia. But a reader named Baeo Maltinsky recently made <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/11/sleep-summary-of-what-ive-learned/#comment-1163569" target="_blank">those discoveries</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back around July 2012, I was trying to improve my diet but I didn&#8217;t want to give up my vegetarianism, so I started to eat a LOT of eggs, usually in the range of 10 to 14 per day. Not long after, I started having awful insomnia. I could lie awake all night just unable to fall asleep. There were suddenly just too many thoughts buzzing through my head keeping me up. I assumed that it was a result of ketosis disturbing sleep. I tried reintroducing carbs, but when that didn&#8217;t work I gave up on dietary modifications. I started cycling through OTC sleep aids, but I developed tolerance to anticholinergics very quickly.</p>
<p>By October 2013, I was going crazy. I couldn&#8217;t sleep well. It was making me depressed and seriously impairing my academic performance. I was exhausted constantly, but then I noticed something. I slept better when I consumed a lot of caffeine in the morning. I noticed there was a clear dose dependent relationship between how much caffeine I consumed and how well I slept. I had a hunch that the caffeine was depleting my acetylcholine levels, serving a similar function as OTC anticholinergics like diphenhydramine and kava.</p>
<p>I wondered what would happen if I sharply reduced my intake of acetylcholine precursors. A lot of people advertise eggs as &#8220;choline packed&#8221;, so I cut back to less than 3 per day. Suddenly, I was sleeping much better. Now, it could be something else in the eggs (I&#8217;m not really attached to my choline hypothesis), but either way I feel confident blaming them for my sleep troubles. My insomnia returns whenever I start eating them again.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him why he hadn&#8217;t realized earlier that eating so many eggs was the problem. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just didn&#8217;t think there was anything special about the eggs. I googled around for it and the only things I could find were about ketosis induced insomnia, so it didn&#8217;t occur to me that eggs specifically were likely to be problematic. I tried consuming enough carbs to knock myself out of ketosis, but when that didn&#8217;t improve the situation, I just assumed that something else was going on aside from diet. Eggs seemed like the perfect food. Cheap, nutrient rich, paleo, easy to prepare, and compatible with my (then) vegetarianism. It would have been hard for me to find a suitable replacement, so while the idea of testing it probably occurred to me, performing the test itself wouldn&#8217;t be trivial and the results wouldn&#8217;t be actionable.</p>
<p>As it got worse, I tried treating it more aggressively with OTC sleep aids, and that worked well enough that I stopped worrying about it. I wasn&#8217;t sleeping great, but it was enough to get by. Eventually they stopped working, but not long after that I made the caffeine connection and decided to try removing eggs. It was easier to do at that point because I had given up on paleo and vegetarianism and could just substitute chicken and sprouted lentils, and I had a (probably<br />
incorrect) neurochemical explanation to support it. Moreover, it had become VERY difficult to eat the eggs. My body just didn&#8217;t want to consume them and I had to slowly force them down. Something seemed to know it was bad for me, but I wasn&#8217;t listening to the signs. My behavior was not at all rational, and believe me after I discovered eggs were the problem I was kicking myself for not trying it sooner.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him what he learned from this, apart from how to sleep better. He replied:</p>
<ol>
<li>Costly experiments sometimes need to be performed.</li>
<li>Sometimes your values are bad for your health.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t give up just because there&#8217;s no evidence to support a hypothesis.</li>
<li>Simple things can easily go unnoticed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are good lessons.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reader named Sam, an engineer in Irving, Texas, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a long time reader of your blog. Based upon your writings, I have taken Vitamin D in the morning and Magnesium Glycinate powder at night for over a year. Both have helped. So I do not have any sleep issues that needed to be addressed. I took the honey only to see if it would make any further difference. I was a bit wary to begin with as I do not usually consume honey. I have had a mild allergy to eating honey until at least several years ago. Even a teaspoon of honey would within an hour give me abdominal cramps that would last for an hour or more.<span id="more-12493"></span></p>
<p>I started a Primal/Paleo/PHD way of eating 3 years ago. No processed foods, no wheat, only fermented dairy (kefir/cheese/cultured butter/ghee), occasional alcohol and occasional desserts (generally fresh fruit or some ice cream) and regular use of home fermented food like sauerkraut, beet kvass and lemonade.</p>
<p>So the honey experiment was also to test whether the changed diet had fixed the allergy.</p>
<p>I tried regular store bought honey (Kroger) first. I took a tablespoon approximately 10 minutes before going to bed. It could be a bit more than a tablespoon as I would dip a regular tablespoon in the jar and eat it as soon as the stringing ended. The first day there was anxiety in expectation of an allergic reaction. No cramps but there was some mild abdominal pain, I would just call it discomfort. I thought this could be psychological. So I tried it for 3 more days. Still the same discomfort within the hour. But I would fall asleep at some point and wake up feeling the same as I used to earlier.</p>
<p>I almost quit after this – when my wife reminded me that we had some Manuka honey in the pantry that we got as a gift and that could be worth trying. So I did. This is a honey produced in New Zealand and has some number on it – that claims to have medicinal properties. This honey was thicker, so easier to measure. About one tablespoon each night, same time as before. Same discomfort – no change in overall sleep quality or post waking up energy. I tried this for 4 days.</p>
<p>It may seem that the obvious course of action would be to quit the experiment at this stage. However, around this time, I read a comment on one of the blogs I follow, describing the process of refining honey for bottling. Apparently it is heated and filtered as a minimum and maybe more processing in most cases. I know a friend who cured his allergy to homogenized milk (skin redness after consumption) by shifting to raw milk which he pasteurizes himself at a low temperature. So I looked for raw unprocessed honey and stumbled upon <a href="http://www.reallyrawhoney.com/category_s/44.htm" target="_blank">a source</a> – which curiously had regular raw honey and fermented raw honey. I ordered a jar of each.</p>
<p>Initially I tried the raw honey, in the morning, in white tea just to test for the abdominal discomfort. Surprisingly, there was none. So I decided to take it at night and continue to see if there are any benefits. One tablespoon as before. I usually fall asleep within a few minutes of turning off the lights. This time, I noticed that I would toss around a bit longer before getting to sleep. However, I did notice that I would wake up more energetic. As I said it is subjective – hard to describe. But I would get ready faster and finish up a few chores that I would be lazy about on other days.</p>
<p>After a week I reduced the dosage to one teaspoon. The only observable change was that the tossing in bed now ceased and I would fall asleep quickly. So I stayed with this dose as a smaller dose is difficult to measure accurately.</p>
<p>After a total of 10 days on regular raw honey, I decided to try the fermented raw honey – only because I had ordered it and had it with me. I stayed with the one teaspoon dose just before bed and immediately noticed one remarkable change besides the increased energy in the morning. Normally, I wake up once at night, around 2AM, to go to the bathroom. The very first night, I slept through till the morning. Subsequently, I have noticed that occasionally I wake up at 5AM but most nights I just sleep through.</p>
<p>It is has definitely increased my sense of well being and post wake up energy.</p></blockquote>
<p>His main conclusions are:</p>
<p>1. Raw honey works better than ordinary (cooked) honey. Manuka honey is no better than ordinary honey. Fermented raw honey is even better than ordinary raw honey.</p>
<p>2. One teaspoon is better than 1 tablespoon &#8212; fell asleep faster.</p>
<p>3. The benefits include less waking up at night, more energy in the morning, an increased sense of well being, and better motivation (e.g., to do chores).</p>
<p>I fall asleep quickly whether or not I take honey at bedtime. But it is curious that fermented honey works better than non-fermented. Fermented honey has less sugar; maybe that&#8217;s the reason for the difference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Mike McInnes is a retired Scottish pharmacist and the author of <a href="https://www.hodder.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781444775907" target="_blank">The Honey Diet</a>, published today. This book interests me because it advocates <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">eating honey at bedtime</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Could you summarize the book?</em></p>
<p>It’s based on two ideas &#8212; that modern obesity is driven by two main factors. First, overconsumption of carbohydrates and sugars. Second, poor quality sleep. The medical profession has been saying that the cause of obesity is fat. We’ve known since the 19th century that it is carbohydrates, not fat. Poor quality sleep drives up stress hormones and appetite hormones.<span id="more-12565"></span></p>
<p>In the West we have an early evening meal. We go to bed with a depleted liver. There is not enough fuel in the liver to supply the brain overnight. The way to resolve that is to forward-provision the brain, via the liver. The best food for that is honey. Honey is liver-specific. It is metabolized differently from other sugars. Honey restocks the liver prior to sleep. No other food can do this in the same way that honey can do this. Fruits are unlike honey because honey contains an army of nutrients, bioflavonoids, organic acids and others that ensure honey is not metabolized in the same way as refined sugars, which have none of these nutrients. Indeed it is fair to describe honey as the most potent anti-diabetic food known to man.</p>
<p><em>What’s the background, the history, of these ideas?</em></p>
<p>I’m a pharmacist. Sold my pharmacy. Went into sport nutrition in the late 1990s. I rapidly discovered that athletes have no concept of brain metabolism or liver store during exercise and recovery. The most critical organ of sport is the liver. I looked for a food that would provide sufficient liver supply during exercise and during recovery. When an athlete collapses, it’s not enough fuel left in the liver. Same at night, you go to sleep without sufficient fuel in the liver, after an early evening meal – and then you cannot recover physiologically – the brain is forced to activate stress and this in turn upgrades the orexigenic (appetite) hormones.</p>
<p>I knew from my physiological background that fructose was a key sugar to replenish the liver, fructose is liver specific &#8211; it only goes to the liver, where it is converted to glucose and stored as liver glycogen. It also brings glucose into the liver – it liberates the glucose enzyme – glucokinase and optimizes the liver (cerebral) energy reserve. Fructose is critical to replenishing the liver. At the time the usual line was the fructose goes only to muscle, and therefore had no role to play is exercise and fueling in sport.</p>
<p>Birmingham University did studies on fructose with success. Now every sports drink in the world contains fructose. They missed the nocturnal physiology. You have to replenish your liver before sleep. If you have a six or seven o’clock meal, you don’t have enough in the liver to see the brain through the nocturnal fast. Having discovered that honey was the key fuel to refuel the liver before sleep, I then developed the theory of replenishing the liver before sleep. Honey is the gold standard food for doing that – no other food that I know of can do this as can honey, and without digestive burden.</p>
<p><em>Have you tested other foods?</em></p>
<p>You will find thousands of studies on the Mediterranean Diet. I only know of one scientist who has written about the key question of timing. With this diet you have healthy meal that contains fruits and vegetables at 11 pm. The key principle is the timing. That would allow significant liver replenishment of the liver via the fruits and vegetables. That meant the brain had a good liver supply for sleep. The brain could activate the recovery system via the pituitary gland. That meant you were reducing the risk of all the degenerative diseases – diabetes, dementia, obesity and heart disease.</p>
<p>They’ve now stopped that. They now do as we do in Europe and America, they have an early evening meal. The fastest growing rate of these diseases is in the southern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>I just looked at the nutrient content of other foods.</p>
<p>I wrote a book in 1995 based on utilizing honey at night. We got feedback from all around the world. What the effect of the honey was on nocturnal physiology. It’s not difficult to work out what’s going on, it’s quite simple. The response from readers was that honey at bedtime, in addition to better sleep, produced changes like &#8220;fitter/stronger/healthier/improved mental acuity/less nausea and morning sickness&#8221; &#8212;  all of which can be attributed to reduced adrenaline/cortisol and glucagon, to nocturnal energy homeostasis, and improved anabolic profile.</p>
<p>For decades, people have said sleep is a low energy system. That’s wrong. Sleep is a high-energy system. Is the brain optimally fueled from the liver in advance of sleep? That’s the critical question. The brain has about 30 seconds worth of glucose. About 5 grams in the blood. The blood glucose would last 5 minutes. The only store that matters to the brain is how much reserve fuel is in the liver. Your liver has about 65-75 g of glucose in capacity. It releases 10 g every hour into the circulation – around 6-6 and a half grams to the brain. Do the math, you see the brain is in trouble at any tome is the 24 hour cycle if the liver reserve is low – especially in advance of the night fast. The brain cannot use fats for that purpose. The body cannot convert fat to glucose. Never. What it can do is during starvation it can convert fat to ketones and use the ketones for energy. But you have to be starving for that to happen. The brain must be fully provisioned prior to sleep. The gold standard food for that is honey.</p>
<p><em>What about eating a banana or apple in place of honey?</em></p>
<p>A tablespoon of honey is equivalent to a small or medium apple. However the apple doesn’t have the huge number of nutrients that affect honey’s ability to metabolize optimally in the liver and to stabilize blood glucose concentration. Honey has 200 non-nutrients that make a difference. If you took fruit at night, you would get significant liver replenishment but not as much as honey.</p>
<p>Of course a perfectly good case may be made for fruits and indeed vegetables before sleep since they both have an appr. 1:1 ratio of fructose to glucose, as does honey.  However there are many additional nutrients in honey that improve insulin signalling, and partition and disposal of the sugars that are not in these foods &#8211; hence honey is a potent anti-diabetic food &#8211; it improves the action of two of our most widely used anti-diabetic medications &#8211; metformin and glibenclamide &#8211; I am not aware of any other sugar or sugar containing food that can do that. In the fullness of time we may find other foods/fuels that are as good as, or better than, honey, but the present knowledge is that honey is the Gold Standard. Nothing wrong with some added fiber &#8211; but not required at night, and adds digestive burden.</p>
<p><em>When is the best time to take the honey?</em></p>
<p>The honey should be taken as close to bedtime as possible.</p>
<p><em>Why that timing?</em></p>
<p>You have to do the mathematics of liver capacity and liver release. We’ve done several local studies on it. One German scientist is interested in this – Christian Benedict at Lubeck University. I wrote an earlier book on this subject that got a huge amount of responses from around the world. People saying how it transformed their sleep patterns. We found there was a significant improvement. It’s not a complicated issue.</p>
<p><em>Why call it a diet?</em></p>
<p>The only time you burn body fat exclusively is when you are sleeping. During exercise you burn both glucose and fat. You also burn muscle fat. Let’s take a 90-minute moderate intensity work out. A BBC study was done. The subject burned 19 g of fat. Overnight when the physiologist measured it he had burned 49 g of fat. What he did not understand during the exercise that although the total fat was 19 g, half of that was body fat, half was muscle fat. His attempt to explain why he burned more fat overnight was nonsense. The reason is very simple. Recovery physiology is highly expensive and exclusively ues body fat as the fuel from the circulation. If you burn 19 g during the workout then the half which is the body fat portion is 9.5 g. Now you can understand the relationship between exercise physiology and nocturnal physiology with respect to body fat used &#8211; it was 5 times as much during the night as during the workout. The key to recovery physiology is how much fuel is in liver. The study that reached that conclusion was done in 1950 and was and is ignored by the scientific establishment. It was a study on mitosis in mice. It traced the mitosis (cell division), an index to recovery. The main point was the recovery depends on the level of glycogen in the liver. This study also noted that recovery utilizes fat – again missed by the scientific establishment to this day.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff that I do is already there in the literature, you just need to know where to look. There’s only one scientist that I know of who has developed the same idea about sleep. Christian Benedict at Lubeck in northern Germany. The brain’s stress system is activated during the night because of the brain’s requirement for fuel. He looked at nocturnal physiology. He looked at the stress system overnight. He didn’t measure the effect of honey. It’s likely that once the book is published, there’s an important group at Lubeck called the Selfish Brain Group who are interested in the relation between cerebral energy deprivation and obesity. They are focusing on the concept that obesity is driven by chronic cerebral glucose deprivation. Basically the same as my theory. Some differences.</p>
<p>The foods we eat overload the circulation with energy. It means that if the glucose in that system went into the brain the brain would fry to death. The cerebral glucose pump, which is called the iPump, is suppressed. This is my theory. Consequently the glucose that you are consuming when you eat a high carb meal does not transfer into the brain. That means the brain is now deprived of energy so you are forced to go back and eat more and you repeat the cycle.</p>
<p>The time we burn body fat is when we are sleeping. For that to happen you have to activate the recovery system. For that to happen the brain has to have reserve fuel in the liver. If the brain does not have enough fuel in the liver it cannot activate recovery, it has to activate stress. The highest consumption of energy during the night is REM sleep and that’s when you learn. There’s another fundamental question that we need to address. The scientific and health professions will tell you if you are diabetic, you increase your risk of dementia dramatically. They’ve got that completely the wrong way around because suppressing the cerebral glucose pump is incipient dementia. It means that your brain is already deprived of energy – it’s already starving. The first thing that happens is we overload the systemic system with glucose. The second is that we overproduce insulin. Both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulin suppress the cerebellar glucose pump (iPump). That is incipient dementia. Then the excess glucose in the circulation is converted to fat via insulin. Now you’re becoming obese. Eventually your ability to keep your glucose stable by storing it as fat breaks down – you become insulin resistant – and then you become diabetic. The first system of energy impairment is in the brain. Then in the body – the sequence is first incipient dementia and chronic cerebral glucose deprivation (hunger) – then the excess circulating energy is converted to fat – then this protective mechanism breaks down – you become insulin resistant – that is diabetic.</p>
<p>I’m a retired pharmacist. I don’t have access to university science and study facilities. I just use the existing literature – however this is changing and a number of academics are now interested. There’s nothing that I’ve said that is not based on the literature.</p>
<p><em>If people take honey at bedtime they will lose weight?</em></p>
<p>This has been confirmed over and over again. Anecdotally, of course. Talking to athletes. Hundreds of people. After the first book, we got feedback from all around the world. Small to massive weight loss. Many people lost several stone. The new book has more science and is based on new science as well that is emerging almost daily. They’re realizing that Alzheimer’s and diabetes are basically the same disease. They still think that diabetes causes Alzheimer’s, whereas it’s the other way around. Chronic cerebellar glucose deprivation – that is incipient dementia causes obesity and diabetes. Any high energy system which is overloaded will short circuit. That’s what sugars are doing to the brain. The mechanism is very simple, sugars and insulin short-circuit the brain by suppressing the cerebral glucose pump – the iPump. If your blood sugar is too high it reduces the blood sugar/energy in the brain. That means if you have a high carb meal, less glucose enters the brain. Within 15 minutes, you’re hungry again. This is why carbohydrates make you hungry sooner. The explanation is stunningly simple.</p>
<p>You see people on TV who are gigantic. That’s the reason. These people are suffering from chronic cerebral hunger. The more they eat, the worse it gets.</p>
<p><em>I lost weight when I drank sugar water. Can you explain that?</em></p>
<p>I saw that. The fructose would replenish the liver. If the liver is replenished, the brain thinks that’s fine. There’s research by a guy named Maricio Russeck in Mexico. He discovered glucose receptors in the liver. He advocated the notion, which was correct, that the liver is critical in appetite control. That’s now being confirmed by recent science.</p>
<p><em>How is <i>The Honey Diet</i> different from the earlier book?</em></p>
<p>That book was based on restocking the liver before sleep. There’s much more science in this book. The scientific world has moved on in two ways. It’s now looking at honey in a serious way. Also, the question of low carbohydrate versus low fat diets is now becoming a major issue.</p>
<p><em>How would you sum this up?</em></p>
<p>The critical measure for the brain in all feeding and appetite regulation is based not on what’s in the blood but what’s in the liver. Russeck was spot on, 5 decades ahead of his time. These are absolutely critical questions. Let’s focus on dementia. There’s 35 million demented people in the world. That doubles every 20 years. One hundred years from now, one billion people are demented. The human brain is now shrinking, it’s not growing. That’s because one percent of those demented people is genetically driven. What is causing the other 99% of dementia, which has happened in the last 40-50 years? The answer is sugar. Refined carbohydrates. Processed foods. Honey is metabolized differently than refined sugars.</p>
<p><em>If I drink fructose and glucose in water at bedtime, it would have a different effect?</em></p>
<p>Yes, because they don’t contain the nutrients that are in honey that enable it to be metabolized differently. In America, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) drives obesity. It overloads the liver with fructose and it’s then converted to fat.</p>
<p><em>HFCS at bedtime would have quite a different effect than honey?</em></p>
<p>Yes, for sure.</p>
