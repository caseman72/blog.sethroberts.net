				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to summarize what I&#8217;ve learned about how to sleep well. I&#8217;ve found about a dozen changes that helped. Taken together they suggest the importance of four dimensions:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Healthy brain</strong>. My sleep greatly improved <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">when I ate a lot of pork fat</a>. (As far as I can tell, <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">butter</a> produced the same effect.) I wasn&#8217;t getting enough animal fat. My sleep also improved when I started eating honey at bedtime. I assume honey raised blood sugar to better levels during sleep, improving brain performance. The great importance of this, I believe, is why we evolved preferences that push us to eat strongly sweet foods, such as fruit, separately and later, i.e., dessert. Bedtime honey also caused my muscles to grow more in response to exercise &#8212; a sign of better sleep, since muscles grow during sleep. I have never measured the effect of flaxseed/flaxseed oil on my sleep but <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">the brain benefit was so clear</a> in other ways I&#8217;d be surprised if it didn&#8217;t improve sleep.<span id="more-12236"></span></p>
<p>2. <strong>Strong oscillation</strong>. Sleep is controlled by three oscillators. The larger the amplitude of their summed output, the deeper sleep.</p>
<p>One oscillator &#8212; the well-known one &#8212; is sensitive to the light/dark cycle (especially blue light). It makes us active and awake during the day, inactive and asleep at night. Its amplitude depends on the amplitude of the light/dark cycle, which can be increased by sunlight or <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">daylight fluorescent light</a> in the morning, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/27/correlation-between-moon-phase-and-sleep-quality-supports-importance-of-dark-bedroom/" target="_blank">a darker bedroom</a>, and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/12/orange-glasses-at-night-improve-sleep/" target="_blank">less blue light in the evening</a>. <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">Vitamin D3 in the morning</a> seems to have the same effect as sunlight, and is much more convenient.</p>
<p>A second oscillator is sensitive to when we eat. To ensure we&#8217;re active when food is available, it wakes us up about three hours earlier. If you usually eat at noon, for example, it will wake you up at 9 am. I realized the practical importance of this oscillator, which is well known to circadian-rhythm researchers, when I found that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">not eating breakfast reduced how often I woke up too early</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">The third oscillator is controlled by the sight of faces</a> &#8212; what you see during a conversation. It also controls mood, making us happy, eager, and serene during the day and unhappy, reluctant, and irritable at night . If things are working properly, most of the bad mood will happen while we are asleep. During a critical period in the morning, faces &#8220;push&#8221; this oscillator much as you push a swing. It evolved to synchronize the sleep and mood of a community so that everyone is awake, happy and eager to work at the same time. Two people cannot work together if one of them is asleep.</p>
<p>3. <strong>&#8220;Poison&#8221; avoidance</strong>. Alcohol and caffeine can make my sleep worse, no surprise there.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Muscle growth</strong>. Exercise that causes muscle growth deepens sleep, whereas aerobic exercise does not. (Aerobic exercise may make you fall asleep faster, which has never been a problem of mine.) <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">Standing more than 8 hours during the day produced better sleep; less standing (such as 6 hours) did not</a>. This was too hard to be practical. Later I found that <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">standing on one leg to exhaustion had similar effects</a>. That was practical &#8212; I still do it.</p>
<p>The biggest advances, compared to what was already known, are morning faces and bedtime honey (brought to my attention by <a href="http://music.anu.edu.au/people/stuart-king" target="_blank">Stuart King</a>), with Vitamin D (<a href="http://www.primalgirl.com/2011/11/01/nprimalgirl-sleep-issues-vitamin-d/" target="_blank">discovered by Tara Grant</a>) honorable mention.</p>
<p>A recent editorial in the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/curing-insomnia-to-treat-depression.html?src=rechp&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">New York Times</a> </em>described mainstream thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>The brief course of sleep therapy teaches patients to establish a regular wake-up time; get out of bed during waking periods; avoid reading, watching TV or other activities in bed; and eliminate daytime napping, among other tactics. It is distinct from standard sleep advice, like avoiding coffee and strenuous exercise too close to bedtime.</p></blockquote>
<p>I imagine the health experts of 1950 gave similar advice.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.cholesterol-and-health.com/2011/03/getting-better-sleep-cool-dark-and-lots.html?m=1" target="_blank">Chris Masterjohn&#8217;s comments</a> about sleep (thanks to Stuart King for the link) illustrate what a very smart very well-informed person figured out. Like me, he stresses animal fat and the light/dark cycle (morning sunlight and dark bedroom). Unlike me, he thinks a cool room helps. I have varied room temperature and didn&#8217;t notice a difference. He mentions Vitamin B6 but I eat enough meat that I am unlikely to be deficient. He says carbs help but doesn&#8217;t narrow it down to honey at bedtime. He doesn&#8217;t mention morning faces or morning Vitamin D. Neither Chris nor I emphasize magnesium, which <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/marek-doyle/help-me-sleep-magnesium-secret-to-sleep-problems_b_3311795.html" target="_blank">some people praise highly</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the SLD forums, <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8193.msg104982#msg104982">Anima describes</a> using several  safe cheap treatments to improve his mood and sleep. First, he tried wearing blue blocker (amber) glasses in the evening. They made him fall asleep more easily and reduced or eliminated hypomania. However, he was still depressed. Second, he tried getting twenty minutes of sunlight early in the morning. His mood improved. But he still had trouble synchronizing his sleep/wake cycle with the sun &#8212; that is, being awake during the day and asleep at night. He would stay up an hour later every night and wake up an hour later every day, meaning that half the time he was asleep during the day and awake at night. Finally, he tried adjusting when he ate:</p>
<blockquote><p>I recently found the missing key to this: meal timing.  I saw a talk that Seth gave where he talked about curing his problem with waking too early by skipping breakfast.  My problem was difficulty waking.  I read an article that suggested that our circadian rhythms are not just tied to light, but to food times as well.  I used to eat late at night and never eat breakfast.  I started eating breakfast immediately upon waking (ick) and stopping all food at least 12 hours before I wanted to wake.  Basically, I did what Seth did only opposite.  It worked. . . . I was even able to adjust my cat&#8217;s circadian rhythm &#8212; he used to wake me up too early for his breakfast &#8212; by gradually moving his supper time.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8204.msg105131#msg105131">another post</a> he describes using B vitamins to treat his restless legs syndrome and ADHD:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been taking a supplement with all the B vitamins in amounts much higher than typically recommended. I have also been taking Epsom salt baths for magnesium. I have not experienced restless legs AT ALL since starting. This is quite remarkable to me, because it was such a problem. My ADHD is also much improved.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of treating restless legs syndrome with niacin (a B vitamin) came from <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/05/17/restless-legs-syndrome-niacin-and-web-search/">Dennis Mangan</a>. Anima had noticed that ADHD and restless legs syndrome often occur together.</p>
<p>He makes some reasonable comments about psychiatrists:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why are psychiatrists still acting like neurological problems exist in isolation, when clearly they are all related? [In the sense that you can use what is known about how to cure Problem X to help you cure Problem Y, if X and Y often occur together.] I used to take Lamictal, Depakote, Adderall and Ambien every day. That doesn&#8217;t include all the meds I tried that didn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;m currently wearing amber glasses at night and taking a B complex, flax oil (SLD-style) and bathing in epsom salts three times a week. My mood is more stable than it was on medication, and my ADHD is controlled about the same. My sleep is much better. My psychiatrist told me that I would be on medication for the rest of my life. When I told him that I was using dark therapy and light therapy and had stopped taking my medication, he told me that I was &#8220;playing with fire,&#8221; and that I would end up in a mental institution or commit suicide if I didn&#8217;t resume my medication, despite the fact that I had stopped taking it for longer than it would be effective. I asked him if he had read the research on dark therapy. He hadn&#8217;t, but he assured me that it is pseudoscience. I guess the definition of &#8220;pseudoscience&#8221; is any treatment that doesn&#8217;t make him money. I puckishly asked him if I seemed manic or depressed, and he was forced to admit that I did not.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ability of this psychiatrist to ignore contradictory evidence in front of him resembles <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/10/seth-roberts-grandmother-knows-best-about-crohns-disease.html">what happened to Reid Kimball</a>. He told a UCSF gastroenterologist that he was successfully managing his Crohn&#8217;s with diet. <em>In my experience, Crohn&#8217;s can&#8217;t be managed with diet</em>, the doctor said at the end of the appointment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After trying the Shangri-La Diet, <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8001.msg103539#msg103539">Jazi yechezkel zilber</a> found that other aspects of my research (&#8220;stuff of seth&#8221;) were relevant to his life:</p>
<blockquote><p>Years ago, I was part of a community where people would be up early praying etc. For an hour and then eat together. I  noticed that going there in the morning was good for me, but was  puzzled by the effect. I hypothesized it was the social effect per se.</p>
<p>At some point, I stopped this (what the hell do I have with religion and prayer?) and noticed that I got depressed. I  remember that the depression came with a delay. It was funny to see it,  as I could not make sense of it. But this I remember well. The  depressive effect was not the same day as not going to the prayers but  tomorrow (or later?).</p>
<p>I was not having early awakening then. Afterwards, I started having periodically early awakening, I cannot remember the frequency, but it was there and annoying. Now  when going to the community, I had two hours between awakening and  eating. Whereas at home I would eat immediately after waking. Another  thing that puzzled me was how I came to wake up naturally *before* my  scheduled wake-up time. I used to wake up much later. With food anticipation it makes perfect sense. I woke up two hours before conditioned feeding.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Amish have extremely low rates of depression &#8212; and eat communal breakfasts. The story about early awakening reminds me of a student who told me <em>when you told us this in class I didn&#8217;t believe it but lately I started waking up too early and was puzzled until I realized I had changed my breakfast</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230; is the charming title of <a href="http://seeadamtrain.wordpress.com/2010/10/30/reading-seth-roberts-puts-me-to-sleep/">this post</a> by Adam Stoffa. Actually, reading me <strong>keeps </strong>him asleep. Adam read <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866#page-1">my long self-experimentation paper</a> and came across my discovery that skipping breakfast reduced early awakening. He had early awakening:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would wake up sometime between 0400 and 0430. Six hours of  sleep was not good.  This was a problem that needed my attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like me, he was eating breakfast around 7 am and waking up three hours earlier. He ate a big breakfast. He decided to make breakfast later rather than skip it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I started experimenting with a late breakfast in August.  I was  traveling through multiple time zones at the time.  So I had no idea  whether it was working. But by the time I got back to Korea, eating a  late breakfast was becoming a habit.</p>
<p>After recovering from my jet lag, I noticed that the experiment was  working. Now, I wake up and get out of bed between 0600 and 0615.  Sometimes, I still wake up in the middle of the night, but after a quick  bathroom break, I&#8217;m right back to sleep.  I get to work at 0800.  After  working for an hour, I take a break and eat (e.g. 3 hard boiled eggs,  +/- a cup of cashews or macadamia nuts, and a smoothie). This regiment  has been working well for eight weeks and shows no signs of weakening.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yay!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I stopped eating breakfast when I discovered it made me wake up too early. My Tsinghua students are reading <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">the paper in which I describe my breakfast research</a>. One of them, a freshman, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we [entered] Tsinghua University, the first task we should finish was the military training. [New students have a few weeks of military training.] We were asked to be gathered at 8 o&#8217;clock, and then we would do a lot of trainings. As the training was hard and tiring, we all had to eat breakfast in the morning. And I remembered in those days, we all slept well and were early-awakening. When the trainings were over, we began our classes. The time was also 8 o&#8217;clock, but many times we didn&#8217;t have breakfast in order to save time. Gradually, our awakening time become later and later. Even we set an alarm clock, we felt really reluctant to get up. For a long time, we wondered about that but no idea appeared. Now I got the answer, it has something to do with the breakfast. When I told my roommates, they were indeed surprise. Everyone was curious about why, and I was also interested in that. Maybe if the last day you had breakfast, the next morning your body will still have the motivation to call you up to eat breakfast.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, if you eat at a certain time of day, you will tend to be awake that time of day. The effect has been heavily studied in animals, where it is called <em>anticipatory activity</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning I woke up feeling very refreshed and in a good mood. I&#8217;d slept about six hours. I&#8217;d fallen asleep within seconds of turning off my bedside light. This is what usually happens. I almost always sleep this well. Yet I don&#8217;t avoid caffeine during the day (I drink a lot of tea) nor artificial light at night (I do avoid fluorescent light at night). For a large chunk of my life my sleep was much worse. I never woke up feeling well-rested. I often woke up quite tired but unable to fall back asleep. A few hours later I&#8217;d fall back asleep and sleep a few more hours, much like the biphasic sleep called segmented sleep. Which is more natural &#8212; my current sleep or segmented sleep? <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/21/whats-the-natural-pattern-of-sleep/">As I blogged</a>, several scientists have said that segmented sleep is more natural.<span id="more-1954"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m returning to this topic and sort of repeating myself because sleep is so important, &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/magazine/awakening-to-sleep.html?pagewanted=all">almost everyone I [a<em> NY Times</em> writer] know complains about sleep</a>,&#8221; and the common cold so common. (When I improved my sleep I stopped getting colds.) Here, in chronological order of discovery, is <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">what I&#8217;ve learned improves my sleep</a>:</p>
<p>1.<strong> Aerobic exercise</strong>. When I started swimming, I noticed that I fell asleep much faster &#8212; within a minute rather than within several minutes. Aerobic exercise didn&#8217;t solve the bigger problem of waking up tired, however.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Skipping breakfast</strong>. This reduced early awakening. If you have any doubts about this, read about anticipatory activity in lab animals.</p>
<p>3.<strong> Seeing faces in the morning</strong>. Perhaps this deepens my sleep. It certainly makes it easier to go to bed in the evening (I stop wanting to do anything) and makes me wake up optimistic and looking forward to the day. The difference in how I feel when I wake up is like the difference between black and white and color. These days I watch about an hour of bloggingheads on a 22&#8243; monitor starting around 6 am.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Standing</strong>. I stand on one bent leg to exhaustion at least twice. Before that I got a similar effect by standing 8 hours or more, which was too hard to do every day.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Morning light</strong>. Every morning I go outside about 8 am. I try to stay outside at least 1 hour and ideally more.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Animal fat</strong>. I eat half a stick of butter (60 g) per day.</p>
<p>Maybe the 3 tablespoons of flaxseed oil I drink every day also helps.</p>
<p>Each one of these six factors probably reproduces Stone Age life, when people got a lot more exercise, didn&#8217;t eat breakfast, chatted with their neighbors in the morning, etc. Were all six factors set at Stone Age levels for the Western Europeans that <a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/106.2/ah000343.html">Ekirch writes about</a> or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/magazine/awakening-to-sleep.html?pagewanted=all">Thomas Wehr&#8217;s subjects</a> (both of whom had segmented sleep)? Of course not. Had all six been at Stone Age levels, the segmented sleep seen by Ekirch and Wehr might have disappeared. As my segmented sleep disappeared.</p>
<p>My sleep still has room for improvement. When I stood for 9 or 10 hours I woke up astonishingly well-rested. I felt scrubbed free of tiredness. In the middle of the day, eight hours later, I would marvel how rested I felt. The problem with standing more now is that if I stand on one bent leg more than twice per day my legs get stronger and stronger and it starts to take a long time (e.g., 20 minutes) to reach exhaustion. I&#8217;m also unsure about the best amount of animal fat. More might be better.</p>
<p>Comments that <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/21/whats-the-natural-pattern-of-sleep/#comment-470644">the night is long and sleep is short </a>ignore that we can see by moonlight and starlight and that people chat after dark. In contrast to <a href="http://jdmoyer.com/2010/03/04/sleep-experiment-a-month-with-no-artificial-light/">this experiment with no artificial light</a>, by J. D. Moyer, the things I do to improve my sleep produce no bad effects. And I sleep only six hours per night, which Moyer found isn&#8217;t nearly enough.</p>
<p>Thanks to Heidi for the Moyer and <em>NY Times</em> links.</p>
