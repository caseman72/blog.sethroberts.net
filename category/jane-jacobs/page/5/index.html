					<p>In <em>The Black Swan</em> (2006), Nassim Taleb wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Globalization creates interlocking fragility, while reducing volatility and giving the appearance of stability. In other words it creates devastating Black Swans. We have never lived before under the threat of a global collapse. Financial institutions have been merging into a smaller number of very large banks. Almost all banks are interrelated. So the financial ecology is swelling into gigantic, incestuous, bureaucratic banks â€“ when one fails, they all fall.Â  The increased concentration among banks seems to have the effect of making financial crisis less likely, but when they happen they are more global in scale and hit us very hard. We have moved from a diversified ecology of small banks, with varied lending policies, to a more homogeneous framework of firms that all resemble one another. True, we now have fewer failures, but when they occur â€¦.I shiver at the thought.</p></blockquote>
<p>To me, this sounds Jacobian. Jane Jacobs disliked calls for reduced family size (e.g., Bill McKibben) not merely because she was a third child but because she disliked reducing the diversity of family ecology. In public health, it&#8217;s called the dangers of monoculture. The Irish potato famine (which &#8220;dwells in my memory as one long night of sorrow&#8221; &#8212; William Butler) is a dietary example of Taleb&#8217;s point. When one (potato) crop failed, they all failed.</p>
<p>Self-experimentation is a more positive example of the broad point. Self-experimentation derives its power from two things: 1. Motivation. You are more motivated to solve your own problems than other people&#8217;s problems. 2. Diversity. The self-experimenter can do anything &#8212; change anything, measure anything. Other scientists cannot. For people with serious problems, such as depression, reduced diversity of the associated science (e.g., the science of what causes depression) is a long slow catastrophe when the associated science, because of its restricted nature, cannot find the best solutions (as I believe is the case with depression).</p>
<p>My animal-learning research also centers on this point. It is about what controls variation in behavior. Dave Stahlman (UCLA), <a href="http://pigeonrat.psych.ucla.edu/">Aaron Blaisdell</a> (UCLA), and I will soon finish a paper about this. With too little variation, catastrophe is too likely, as Taleb says. So mechanisms to produce diversity have evolved. Just as the importance of diversity has been neglected by financiers, it has been neglected by research psychologists.</p>

					<p>In 1953 Harvard appointed an architect named Josep Sert to a powerful position. Sert had some amazing ideas. From a <a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=429&#038;storycode=3119895&#038;c=2">review</a> of a new book about him:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the help of Walter Gropius, [Sert] was appointed dean [of the architecture school] at Harvard in 1953, where he set up the worldâ€™s first course on urban design, a perfect platform from which to propagate the modernist Ciam agenda for shaping cities using new science, principles and forms. . . .</p>
<p>As propagandist for a type of urban thinking which would have disastrous consequences, Sert had a programmatic mind-set which could see the beauty of historic cities, but his totalitarian attitude insisted on extrapolating abstract systems out of their features. In 1953, for instance, he proposed that if repeated endlessly, the traditional patio house could make a whole city. . . Sert continued to insist that since the unplanned energy of cities is â€œchaoticâ€ and â€œdisorderlyâ€, the planner must normalise and â€œovercomeâ€ it. He expressed these convictions in abstract terminologies about neighborhoods, scalar zones, urban functions, categories and so on, and in complacent assertions â€” â€œevery city is composed of cells, and the role of planning is to put these cells into some kind of system or relationship.â€</p>
<p>His 1952 plan for Havana is one shocking example. Commissioned by a group of speculators intent on carving up the city, Sertâ€™s Pilot Plan â€œaddressed the entire metropolitan area of Havana, applying Le Corbusierâ€™s rules on classification of roadsâ€, a totally abstract theory. Having destroyed the cityâ€™s historic streets and obliterated all memory of Old Havana, he proposed â€œclustersâ€ of what he supposed would be â€œcharming streets recalling the cityâ€™s originsâ€, but with dimensions that would use the completely abstract principles of Le Corbusierâ€™s Modulor. This awful scenario was to be dominated by â€œtall towers for a new financial districtâ€ which would have wrecked Havana once and for all.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the 1959 Cuban revolution thwarted this insane plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder what real-world events led Hans Christian Andersen to write &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes">The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes</a>.&#8221;</p>

					<p>During Bill McKibben&#8217;s book tour for <em>Maybe One</em> (1998), an argument for having no more than one child, he gave a reading in Berkeley. I attended, and asked a question: <em>Jane Jacobs says the problem isn&#8217;t too many people, the problem is the undone work</em>. (Which I also said at the end of <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>.) For example, air pollution. The solution won&#8217;t be fewer people, it will be cars that pollute less. I asked McKibben what he thought of this. He said he thought highly of Jacobs, butÂ  the EV1 was a failure. Terrible answer, I thought.</p>
<p>Yesterday I spoke to the owner of an electric car. It is entirely powered by electricity from solar panels on the roof of her house. It can&#8217;t go on the highway but is perfectly good for taking her and her two children around town. She&#8217;s had it about a year; she bought it after seeing someone else drive one. Leaving aside the cost of the solar panels, driving costs her almost nothing, is very quiet, and produces no pollution. The car was made in Vancouver. In America, it&#8217;s small; it wouldn&#8217;t be small in Japan. Looks like the future, I thought.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gogreenmotors.com/">Green Motors</a>, a Berkeley store specializing in electric cars, started by the man she bought it from. Lovely website, his enthusiasm shines through. <a href="http://www.greenparty.ca/en/node/3045">Car-maker difficulties</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ItsLikeBensBlog/~3/315907281/if-i-were-youth.html">A long post</a> by Ben Casnocha tells how to give advice. The subject fascinates me because I&#8217;ve noticed what a strong tendency I have to give advice when told of this or that problem &#8212; yet I also realize that advice giving is usually obnoxious. I think this is why Ben&#8217;s post is long: It&#8217;s a difficult problem, like an addiction: The bad consequences are hard to avoid. Why do I have this tendency? No obvious reason. It certainly isn&#8217;t learned or copied or sustained by reward. Why is it obnoxious? Again, there&#8217;s no obvious reason. Giving advice has good and bad aspects: trying to be helpful (good) and acting superior and ignorant (bad). Why the bad seems to predominate I have no idea.</p>
<p>This is one reason I think Jane Jacobs&#8217;s <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/21/can-you-change-something-if-you-dont-love-it/">you can only change what you love</a> is usually true: because in your communication with someone you love (or at least respect) there will be enough positive in the whole message to overcome the negative of the advice itself &#8212; so that the advice doesn&#8217;t push the person away. (Another reason I think she&#8217;s right is that to give good advice you usually need to know a lot about the person you are advising.)</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>At a bookstore reading, I learned that Elizabeth Pisani wrote <a href="http://www.wisdomofwhores.com/"><em>The Wisdom of Whores</em></a> &#8212; about doing HIV epidemiology among sex workers &#8212; because she wanted to have more of an effect on HIV prevention programs. Scientific papers didn&#8217;t have much effect unless a journalist wrote about them.Â  Journalists, she found, tended to focus on the exceptions rather than the rules. The exceptions &#8212; e.g., sex trafficing &#8212; were a poor basis for policy, of course. So she did what drug dealers call &#8220;jump the connection&#8221;: She wrote a book about the rules, illustrating them with good stories. Speaking directly to the public. It seems to be working, she said.</p>
<p>Jane Jacobs (whom Pisani hadn&#8217;t heard of) said something enormously relevant to her enterprise. I think it was in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a funny thing,&#8221; Jacobs told the interviewer. &#8220;You can&#8217;t change something unless you love it.&#8221; What a broad statement, huh? Could it be true? HIV prevention programs, in Pisani&#8217;s experience, have mostly failed. She was hopeful that private foundations could do what governments could not. The Gates Foundation, for example &#8212; could they crush HIV the way Microsoft crushed Netscape? Jacobs would have been skeptical: Is the usual attitude at the Gates Foundation to love, or at least respect, sex workers? Well, probably not. Indeed, the closer Pisani got to private foundations, the more skeptical she became. They were getting advice from former CDC bureaucrats and the like, full of the same ideas that had already failed.</p>
<p>Pisani held up one country as an example of how to do it right: Brazil. Why Brazil? I asked. Funny thing: In Brazil, they respect sex workers. Unlike everywhere else. In this case, at least, Jacobs was right.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong>: <a href="http://www.gse.buffalo.edu/fas/bromley/ccs/part5.htm">Here</a>&#8216;s one version of Jacobs saying this: &#8220;I think people [who] give prescriptions, who have ideas  for improving things, ought to concentrate on the things that they love and that they want to  nurture.&#8221;</p>

					<p>In the 1920s a young woman moved to an isolated North Carolina town in part to oversee construction of a church. When she suggested that it be built out of stones from a nearby river, the locals laughed. It wasn&#8217;t possible to build buildings out of stone, they said. Their ancestors had done so (in Europe); they had forgotten. Jane Jacobs tells this story in <em>Cities and the Wealth of Nations</em>.</p>
<p>Unsophisticated villagers, huh? Yesterday I went to a high school graduation. A private high school in Los Angeles. There were six speakers: two adults, the school&#8217;s headmaster and a history teacher, and four students. Here&#8217;s what was so strange: <em>No one told any stories</em>. (One of the students told the beginning of a story.) The headmaster speaks at every graduation. The history teacher has given hundreds of lectures. Neither of them, apparently, knew to tell a few stories in that situation. No wonder the students didn&#8217;t know. Long ago, before cheap books, I&#8217;m sure everyone knew this basic point about public speaking. Now it&#8217;s as if no one knows it. What a vast forgetting!</p>
<p>I was surprised, but maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have been. <em><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/04/06/made-to-stick/">Made to Stick</a></em> sort of says the same thing. One of the authors, a Stanford professor, asked his students to rate a bunch of short talks. Their ratings had no correlation with how memorable the talks were. In other words, the students had no idea what made a talk memorable. They thought a good talk meant you told a joke. What actually made talks memorable were stories, the research showed.</p>
<p>Even Edward Tufte, a presentation expert, seems to not understand this. In his <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt2.html">complaints about PowerPoint</a>, he doesn&#8217;t tell any stories, doesn&#8217;t say anything about PowerPoint&#8217;s lack of encouragement of stories, and doesn&#8217;t say that students should be taught to tell stories (preferably by example).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m giving a talk next week. It&#8217;s going to be one story after another, which is not what I would have said before that graduation.</p>

					<p>Why did Chinese immigrants to America start so many restaurants? Because Chinese cuisine is glorious, right? Well, no. Chinese immigrants started a lot of laundries, too, and there is nothing wonderful about Chinese ways of washing clothes. As Jennifer Lee explains in <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=WGZ6IwSDyyo">this excellent talk</a>, the first Chinese immigrants were laborers. They were taking jobs away from American men, and this caused problems. Restaurants and laundries were much safer immigrant jobs because cooking and cleaning were women&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>A character in Jane Jacobs&#8217;s <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1D81039F931A35750C0A9669C8B63&#038;n=Top%2FFeatures%2FBooks%2FBook%20Reviews"><em>The Nature of Economies</em></a> says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is why societies that are oppressive to women and contemptuous of their work are so backward economically. Half of their population, doing economically important kinds of work, such cooking and food processing, cleaning and laundering, making garments, and concocting home remedies, are excluded from taking initiatives to develop all that work [that is, start businesses] &#8212; and nobody else does it, either.</p></blockquote>
<p>My grandparents, Jewish immigrants, were in the garment industry. Now I can guess why.</p>

					<p>Soon after it was published, I listened to an audiobook (abridged) version of <a style="border-bottom-style: groove" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed"><em>Collapse</em></a> (2005) by Jared Diamond. It is about how several societies destroyed their ecosystem and died. One example was Easter Island; the islanders cut down all the trees, and disappeared. The whole book was meant as a warning, of course: This can happen to us. At first I liked it &#8212; interesting stories. Then I heard that Jane Jacobs didn&#8217;t like it. I was unable to find out why. I began to wonder what I&#8217;d missed.</p>
<p>Now I can guess what she&#8217;d say: &#8220;<em>Collapse</em> doesn&#8217;t make clear that overexploitation has been avoided countless times. That is the usual outcome. Even before cities, humans were constantly creating new ways to make a living, which decreased reliance on the old ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could make a video that shows Michael Jordan missing 20 free throws in a row. Every moment would be true but the whole thing would be false. That&#8217;s not far from what <em>Collapse</em> does &#8212; at least the audiobook version.</p>

					<p>In answer to a question about what Pittsburgh should do to revive itself, Richard Florida <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/steigerwald/s_550387.html">answered</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I asked Jane Jacobs once, &#8220;What would you do &#8212; as a person who lived in New York in the Village &#8212; to rebuild the World Trade Center site? She said, &#8220;Well, Richard, you asked the wrong question. What would the people who used that site do? What would the people who used to work there do? What would the people who owned shops there do?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The people who used the site know the most about the site. And they care the most about it.</p>
<p>This is one big reason self-experimentation is a good idea: The people with a problem know the most about the problem and care the most about it. People with acne know more and care more about acne than people without it. People with insomnia know more and care more about it. And so on. It&#8217;s a huge resource that conventional research almost completely ignores.</p>

				<small>Thursday, January 24th, 2008</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>At the Freakonomics blog there is a <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/what-dont-we-know-about-the-pharmaceutical-industry-a-freakonomics-quorum/">fascinating &#8220;quorum&#8221;</a> (four people answer the same question) about the drug industry. &#8220;What can you tell us &#8212; good or bad &#8212; that we don&#8217;t know about drug companies?&#8221; was the question. Three of the answers were bad things, one was a good thing &#8212; pretty predictable given who was asked. What interested me was how bad were the bad things (very bad) and how good was the good thing (barely good). The answers make the drug industry look very bad, in other words. </p>
<p>You are reading this because of my fear and dislike of pharmaceutical drugs. Long ago, I had trouble sleeping through the night. If I went to a doctor, I knew I would be given a prescription for a drug that would be ineffective (long-term) and dangerous (due to biases in the way drugs are tested). So I struck out on my own and via self-experimentation eventually <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/117/">found several solutions</a> that did not involve drugs. (The first was to stop eating breakfast.) This is how I realized the power of self-experimentation to find unusual solutions to everyday problems.</p>
<p>Why does an industry entrusted with something so precious &#8212; our health &#8212; come across so badly? In <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_Survival">Systems of Survival</a></em>, Jane Jacobs pointed out two moral &#8220;syndromes&#8221; (sets of values): the commercial syndrome and the guardian syndrome. The commercial syndrome (e.g., be honest) was appropriate for businesses; the guardian syndrome (e.g., be loyal) was appropriate for governments. Why just two? Because there were two fundamental ways of making a living, Jacobs said: trading (business) or taking (government). She pointed out the trouble that arises when governments act like businesses or businesses act like governments. It is bad news, for example, when policemen are given ticket quotas. Quotas are a business tool.</p>
<p>I recently experienced the problem Jacobs pointed out when my scooter was towed by Avenue Tow Service (Berkeley, CA) &#8212; using power given them by the city government. They broke the windshield. No surprise they lied about it. Why should they bother telling the truth? Unlimited power is a government tool. </p>
<p>The drug industry is a much larger example of the same thing. What is trading? You trade voluntarily. The two parties are roughly equal in strength. What is taking? The powerful take from the weak. Although drug companies are businesses, they deal with people who are weak (sick) and have no other choice. So in essence, they take rather than trade. One of the Freakonomics examples of bad behavior was price gouging. </p>
<p>The federal government has given drug companies this power, just as the Berkeley city government gave Avenue Tow Service the power to tow my scooter. The federal government has done so because it has failed to effectively support research into non-drug solutions. (<a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/2002_medical_research--a_bettor's_guide.pdf">Norman Temple and I wrote</a> about how almost all research money goes in the wrong direction.) This leaves the drug industry, like the company that towed my scooter, with a monopoly. Unlike a conventional monopoly (a single company) it is industry-wide. But the effects are the same &#8212; a business starts to take rather than trade. And they do things that, when exposed, make them look very bad.</p>

					<p>Because of reading Jane Jacobs, I could begin to understand <a href="http://baconsrebellion.blogspot.com/2007/12/hey-larry.html">this fascinating post</a> by E. M. Risse about trade vs import replacement. I hadn&#8217;t before heard his point that between-region trade tends to favor people at the top of the economic food chain. I&#8217;m not sure I completely understand Risse&#8217;s post but I am intrigued enough to want to look at his (four-volume!) book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shape-Future-Overarching-Settlement-Environmental/dp/0967810809">The Shape of the Future</a></em>, <em>shape</em> meaning settlement pattern. </p>

<p>The Cleveland painter <a href="http://www.mmuldrow.com/index.php">Michelle Muldrow</a> was a musician for ten years before becoming a painter &#8212; although she got a BFA (Bachelor of Fine Arts) before that. From an unusual background, an <a href="http://thevisualmovement.com/the-visual-movement-interview-with-michelle-muldrow/">unusual creative process</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewer: Describe your working process when creating a new work.</p>
<p>MM: Usually I begin reading about environmental issues, urban development, really anything touching on the subjects of land use, as well American history and fiction. I guess I sort of consider myself a sponge at the beginning stages of work, then usually some travel helps and I take tons of source photos. From there I organize my photos into different obsessions, be it the artificial horticulture and landscaping in the modern developments, or the death of inner ring suburbs, subdivisions, etc, at that point I look for what I am most interested in painting. Itâ€™s sort of like all my intellectual obsessions still must go through a filter of how I feel, and that is an important element to my work- nostalgia. I suppose I attribute that to the rootlessness of my childhood, I am always trying to make sense of my landscape and home. Then I begin the body of my work. I tend to approach my work as a series or body rather than as individual images. I always prep, underpaint and paint at least 4-5 paintings all at once, never one at a time. I freehand draw, then do a monochromatic underpainting, and from there, I paint.</p></blockquote>
<p>Painting, in other words, resembles blogging: You can blog about anything, you can paint anything &#8212; so long as you care about it.</p>
<p>One of her favorite writers is Jane Jacobs. She used to live in San Francisco, where there seemed to be no upper limit on the value of property. In Cleveland, with boarded-up homes everywhere, there seems to be no lower limit.</p>

					<p>Chris Matthews&#8217; latest book is <em>Life&#8217;s A Campaign</em>. &#8220;A recipe for sadness,&#8221; Jon Stewart called it in an interview that Matthews called the worst of his life:</p>
<p><embed FlashVars='videoId=104548' src='http://www.comedycentral.com/sitewide/video_player/view/default/swf.jhtml' quality='high' bgcolor='#cccccc' width='332' height='316' name='comedy_central_player' align='middle' allowScriptAccess='always' allownetworking='external' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' pluginspage='http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer'></embed></p>
<p>In <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_Survival">Systems of Survival</a></em> (1992), Jane Jacobs described two ethical systems: guardian (= government) and commercial. Each system consists of rules of conduct (e.g., &#8220;be honest&#8221; is a commercial value but not a guardian one). Matthews&#8217;s book says you should use guardian principles in everyday life; Stewart said that&#8217;s a mistake &#8212; commercial principles work better. Jacobs said there is a tendency to think that the principles that work well in your system work everywhere. Maybe this is why Matthews seemed stunned by Stewart&#8217;s objections.</p>
<p>To Jacobs&#8217; two systems, <a href="http://www.crnano.org/about_us.htm#Principals">Chris Phoenix</a>, a nanotechnology expert, has added a third: the &#8220;<a href="http://www.nanotech-now.com/Chris-Phoenix/diverse-ethics.htm">information system</a>&#8220;. It is about appropriate behavior &#8212; what is seen as appropriate behavior &#8212; in the world of open source software and similar goods. Phoenix argues persuasively that a different set of values applies. This is why I asked Aaron Swartz <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/09/28/aaron-swartz-on-whats-wrong-with-wikipedia/">what&#8217;s wrong with Wikipedia</a>: It&#8217;s not so obvious what the appropriate values are.</p>
<p>Long before open source software <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/seth-roberts/books-were-the-first-open_b_35844.html">there were books</a>: books share expertise. Long before books &#8212; at the <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/27/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">dawn of humanity</a>, I believe &#8212; there were hobbies: hobbyists share their expertise. The ethical system that Phoenix describes is much older and more important than he says. Phoenix acted within that system when he posted his essay on the Web; Jacobs did, too, when she wrote a book. Just as I do by blogging.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/09/28/aaron-swartz-on-whats-wrong-with-wikipedia/">Speaking of Wikipedia</a>, the LA Times has an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-webscout30sep30,0,344107.story?coll=la-home-center">interesting article</a> today about what happened when Jimmy Wales &#8212; the founder &#8212; posted a one-sentence article about a butcher shop on the outskirts of Cape Town. It was deleted quickly &#8212; not important enough &#8212; but then a big debate ensued. The <em>Times</em> piece turned to the bigger issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps the granddaddy of all the Wikipedia debates is the question of which information deserves to be included, and which doesn&#8217;t. So-called Inclusionists believe that because Wikipedia is not bound by the same physical limits as a paper encyclopedia, it shouldn&#8217;t have the same conceptual limits either. If there&#8217;s room for an article on unreleased Kylie Minogue singles &#8212; and a group of people who might find it useful &#8212; why not include it? Deletionists, meanwhile, believe that because not all articles are created equal, judicious pruning increases the overall quality of Wikipedia&#8217;s information and strengthens its reputation. An encyclopedia, they say, is not just a dumping ground for facts.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the people who run craigslist try hard to figure out what users want and how to give it to them &#8212; starting with the assumption that they themselves do not know &#8212; the people who run Wikipedia play God, at least by comparison. In this debate, both sides are playing God. As <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/09/28/aaron-swartz-on-whats-wrong-with-wikipedia/">Aaron Swartz said</a>, it isn&#8217;t wise. Jane Jacobs tells a story about a Pennsylvania Girl Scout troop. They were snobs; they made it hard for new members to join (the Wikipedian attitude that Aaron criticized). The girls who couldn&#8217;t get in formed their own troop. Several years later the new troop was thriving; the old troop was dying.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, September 26th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Jane Jacobs tells a story about a handed-down meatloaf recipe: After the loaf is made, the end is cut off. &#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always done it that way,&#8221; she was told. The original recipe was for a smaller oven, it turned out; the end was cut off to make the loaf fit in the oven.</p>
<p>I thought of this story when I read a <a href="http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/167/17/1892">recent study</a> in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> that compared three treatments for back pain: acupuncture, &#8220;sham acupuncture,&#8221; and &#8220;conventional therapy.&#8221; Sham acupuncture was like acupuncture except that the needles were put in &#8220;wrong&#8221; places, inserted less deeply, and not rotated after insertion. Conventional therapy was drugs, physical therapy, and exercise. The study found that acupuncture and sham acupuncture were equally effective. Both were much better than conventional therapy. The results imply that acupuncture works, but the surrounding theory (meridians, etc.) is wrong. Which I find reassuring.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy is essentially the same. Lots of studies show that psychotherapy helps &#8212; but many studies also imply that the surrounding theory is wrong. Untrained therapists are as effective as trained therapists. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2006/10/11/the-writing-cure/">Keeping a journal</a> has similar effects. The active ingredient may be telling your problems, just as the active ingredient of acupuncture is apparently needle insertion.</p>
<p>Ritual &#8212; doing something just because &#8212; can be found in meatloaf recipes, acupuncture, psychotherapy, and clinical trials. In the discussion section of the acupuncture paper, the authors wrote: </p>
<blockquote><p>Potential limitations of this study [include] inability to blind acupuncturists to the form of acupuncture.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as the meatloaf cooks did not understand their recipe, the acupuncture researchers did not understand their research design. The original reason for blinding was to equate expectations. That the two forms of acupuncture came out equal in spite of <em>unequal</em> expectations among the therapists is <em>better</em> evidence that expectations were not important. The authors failed to grasp that lack of blinding worked in their favor.</p>
<p>Thanks to Hal Pashler.</p>

				<small>Sunday, August 19th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Rexford Township, Michigan, has started to pay police officers <a href="http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/13919921/detail.html">according to the number of tickets they write</a>. In <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_Survival">Systems of Survival</a></em>, a book about moral systems, Jane Jacobs criticized something similar: ticket quotas for police. Treating guardians (such as police) as if they were in commerce doesn&#8217;t work well, she wrote. There are two ways of making a living (taking and trading). Both have value, but they need to follow different rules of conduct (which we may grandly call <em>morals</em>) to work well.</p>
