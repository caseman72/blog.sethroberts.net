<li><a href="http://anothersb.blogspot.com/2014/04/dear-academia-i-loved-you-but-im.html" target="_blank">Postdoc leaves academia</a> (fMRI emotion research). &#8220;I actually ran into that process in three different labs, two of which were at TopUniversityA with PIs who I highly revered and respected. It&#8217;s just how it goes in those fields&#8230;remove all of the negative results, don&#8217;t actually report the ridiculous number of fishing expeditions you went on (especially in fMRI research), make it sound like you mostly knew what you were going to find in the first place, make it a nice clean story. When my colleagues (from a well-known, well-respected emotion research lab) were trying to talk me into removing all of the negative results and altering what my original hypothesis was, literally saying &#8220;everyone does it&#8230;&#8221; that was it for me. I had a sinking feeling that everyone did do it that way and that I couldn&#8217;t trust the majority of work I had to depend on/reference myself. The level of denial in psychology and human neuroimaging research that this process just clogs the system with useless BS is something I just can&#8217;t stomach.&#8221; Devastating criticism &#8212; especially finding the same thing in three different labs. I believe nothing involving fMRI and psychology. My friend Hal Pashler <a href="http://www.pashler.com/Articles/Vul_etal_2008inpress.pdf" target="_blank">wrote about this</a>. At UC Berkeley, the fMRI machine used by psychology researchers malfunctioned for years. Nobody noticed. Only when someone from UC Davis got different results at Berkeley was the problem detected.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philip Seymour Hoffman, the great actor, was found dead a few days ago with a needle in his arm. Last year, Cory Montieth, the actor, died in similar circumstances. Why did they die? It was hardly the first time they&#8217;d taken heroin.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1970s, <a href="http://www.science.mcmaster.ca/pnb/people/60-faculty-web-pages/202-dr-shepard-siegel.html" target="_blank">Shepard Siegel</a>, a psychology professor at McMaster University, did <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-98225-006" target="_blank">a series of rat experiments</a> that showed that drug tolerance and craving involved a large amount of Pavlovian conditioning. Repeated exposure (e.g., injection) of Drug X in Situation Y (e.g., your bedroom at 11 p.m.) will cause learning of an association between X and Y. This association has two effects. First, when exposed to Y, you will crave X. Second, when you take Drug X in Situation Y, the effect of the drug is diminished. You become &#8220;tolerant&#8221; to it. <span id="more-12965"></span></p>
<p>You have probably experienced both effects &#8212; they occur with caffeine, chocolate and alcohol, for example &#8212; but are unaware of Siegel&#8217;s explanation: Situation-drug associations. After you learn the association, Siegel said, the situation generates a response in your body that opposes (reduces) the drug effect. If the drug makes you less sensitive to pain, the conditioned response is more pain sensitivity. If the drug makes you awake, the conditioned response makes you sleepy. It&#8217;s easy to realize that drug craving involves associative learning: You notice that you crave coffee or whatever in familiar situations but not unfamiliar ones. You crave Drug X at college but not at home. It&#8217;s much harder to grasp that the tolerance involves associative learning.</p>
<p>Drug users, such as Hoffman and Montieth, as they become &#8220;tolerant&#8221;, take larger and larger doses, not realizing that their &#8220;tolerance&#8221; depends on a learned association. The situation becomes more and more dangerous because if you take the drug without eliciting the conditioned compensatory response, you may die. Without the conditioned response, a drug amount you survived yesterday may kill you today.</p>
<p>Siegel explored the possibility that this actually happened &#8212; that drug addicts died of &#8220;drug overdose&#8221; because they took the drug under unusual circumstances that didn&#8217;t evoke the compensatory response. He found plenty of support for this idea. One sort of support was <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03333867" target="_blank">interviews with &#8220;overdose&#8221; survivors</a>. They often described unfamiliar circumstances at the time of the injection &#8212; e.g., there&#8217;s usually music, but this time there wasn&#8217;t. Another sort of support was <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk%2Fstaff%2Fmxh%2FC83CLI%2FSiegal%2520et%2520al%2520(1983).pdf" target="_blank">a rat experiment with heroin</a>. After developing tolerance to heroin, rats injected with a really large dose in a strange situation were much more likely to die than rats injected with the same dose in the same situation where they became tolerant.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure Hoffman and Montieth didn&#8217;t know about this research. There is a connection with the Shangri-La Diet. In both cases, Pavlovian learning has a big effect on something we care a lot about (life/death in the drug case, body weight in the diet case) and this connection is highly non-obvious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Your writing has dramatically improved my health in a number of ways,&#8221; a reader said. I asked for details. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve tried most of your health interventions. The first was SLD. Overall, I lost about 90 lbs. Roughly half of this was from a more traditional diet of eating whole foods esp. vegetables and exercise. I had plateaued until I discovered SLD and lost the rest. I added flax oil, butter and homemade kefir to my taste free meal over time. The butter helped me lose more weight. At the same calories, the saturated fat was somehow more filling. Initially the butter made me happier but that wore off after a few months. My HDLs and triglyceride levels are better than when I was training for a marathon and not eating this stuff. The flax oil has improved my gum health. I can&#8217;t really see a direct result from the kefir. I&#8217;m more eating it on faith. I skinned my knees quite badly a while ago. My wife commented on how quickly I healed. So maybe the kefir and other items are helping me heal faster.<span id="more-12861"></span></p>
<p>I tried morning faces twice over about a week without success. My job exposes me to a lot of evening fluorescent lights. I picked periods when I wouldn&#8217;t be exposed, but even if it worked, I couldn&#8217;t have maintained it over a long period.</p>
<p>Insomnia has been a long-time problem for me. One legged standing didn&#8217;t have a noticeable impact. Shifting my vitamin D3 to the morning seemed to help a bit. Bedtime honey has led to a big improvement. It&#8217;s uneven, but more often than not I&#8217;m sleeping much better. Even when I don&#8217;t sleep as well, I don&#8217;t feel as tired as I did without using honey. My mood has also improved. I&#8217;m calmer and happier. The honey seems to reinforce my circadian rhythm. I have more energy in the morning and am tired in the evening. I&#8217;m currently tracking what else I&#8217;m consuming and when to see if I can figure out how to get the benefits on the honey more consistently. My wife and friend have tried honey at bedtime and both report improvements.</p></blockquote>
<p>My view is that of the cause-effect relations I have emphasized, the most useful will be (a) the <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">effect of morning faces on mood</a> (hard to use at first), (b) the <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/honey-sleep/" target="_blank">effects of sweets on sleep</a> (easy), and (c) the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114619130176100669530" target="_blank">effects of foods on brain function</a>b. Bedtime honey is just the first of the sweets effects and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">flaxseed oil and butter</a> are just the first of the brain effects. Full understanding and use of the morning faces discovery lies many years in the future. Of the various methods I&#8217;ve developed, I think the most useful will be the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114619130176100669530" target="_blank">use of reaction time measurements to improve brain function</a> (and, probably, overall health). At the level of what might be called &#8220;meta-methods&#8221; (the usual name is <em>big ideas</em>), I think the most useful will be that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/" target="_blank">people who aren&#8217;t health experts can discover important things about health</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nassim Taleb said this or something close to it on the first day of the Ancestral Health Symposium in Atlanta, which was yesterday. Danielle Fong told me something similar last week: We should use all of our metabolic pathways. Of course it is hard to know what metabolic pathways you are using. In contrast, Taleb&#8217;s point &#8212; not original with him, but a new way (at least to me) of summarizing research &#8212; is easily applied.</p>
<p>What I know overwhelmingly supports Taleb&#8217;s point. 1. When I did the Shangri-La Diet the first time, I was stunned how little hunger I felt. This wasn&#8217;t bad &#8212; presumably my set point had been too high, lack of hunger reflected the dropping set point, it was good to know how to lower the set point &#8212; but it was dreary, not feeling hunger. It was as if life had gone from color to black and white. Something was missing. 2. Data supporting the health benefits of intermittent fasting, which produces more hunger than the control condition. 3. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/28/effect-of-alternate-day-fasting-on-a-friend/" target="_blank">The experience of my friend</a> who had great benefits from alternate-day fasting. He told me he had never felt hunger before, at least of that magnitude. A great increase in hunger, in other words, happened at exactly the same time as a great improvement in health.</p>
<p>Obviously Taleb is talking about hunger caused by lack of food, rather than hunger caused by learned association (if you eat at noon every day you will become hungry at noon, if you eat every time you enter Store X, you will be come hungry when you enter Store X, the existence of this effect is why they are called appetizers). The Shangri-La Diet reduces your set point but only if your set point controls when/how much you eat is this going to make a difference. So to lose weight you need to do two things: 1. Lower your set point. 2. Lower your weight to your set point. While SLD certainly does #1, it does not do #2. You can make sure your weight is near your set point if you feel strong hunger if you don&#8217;t eat for a while.</p>
<p>Taleb&#8217;s comment suggests focussing on the outcome of fasting, rather than on its duration or frequency. Instead of fasting every other day (or whatever), fast until you feel strong hunger. How often you need to do this, how strong the hunger should be, are questions to answer via trial and error.</p>

<blockquote><p>All my life I had been the fat guy. I was that kid in school that couldn&#8217;t run or go out and play because I was too heavy. You know how that is. </p>
<p>My teenage years and all my adult life I had been the fat guy. Until today.</p>
<p>I tried every kind of diet to my knowledge. I exercise since I have memory. But I never could lose enough weight or maintain the little weight loss I could achieve. </p>
<p>Until I read Freakonomics, which led me to research about Seth and SLD, which led  me to these forums and to reading the book. </p>
<p>So last January [January 2013], after reading a little about how SLD works, I decided to give it a go.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started drinking lots of tea when I started the Shangri-La Diet. The diet made me crave food with smell, which tea provided. I started chewing gum, too, but that was less enjoyable, maybe because I never became a gum connoisseur.</p>
<p>I recently learned about <a href="http://teeccino.com/" target="_blank">Teeccino</a> coffee-substitute &#8220;tees&#8221; (brewed like tea) from Patrick Pineda of <a href="http://tisano.com/" target="_blank">Tisano</a>. They resemble <a href="http://internaturalfoods.com/brands/pero.html" target="_blank">Pero</a> but with more flavor and variety. I really liked the first two flavors I tried (Vanilla Nut and French Roast) so I wrote to Teeccino asking for samples of all the flavors. In addition to no caffeine, Teechino drinks are high in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin" target="_blank">inulin</a>, a soluble fiber.</p>
<p>Here are my comments on the samples.</p>
<p><strong>Dandelion Dark Roast</strong>. Similar to French Roast (relatively strong coffee taste) but more earthy-tasting. Maybe that&#8217;s the dandelion.</p>
<p><strong>French Vanilla</strong>. Strong vanilla taste. Too much like vanilla for me, I want something more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Caramel Nut</strong>. Halfway between  caramel and burnt caramel, which I like. As complex as French Roast.</p>
<p><strong>Mocha</strong>. Excellent. Complexity of coffee plus complexity of chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>Chocolate</strong>. Like mocha, except darker coffee flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Original</strong>. Excellent. Weaker coffee flavor plus fruity complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Almond Amaretto</strong>. Wonderful combination of coffee flavor with nutty almond/amaretto flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Java</strong>. Rounded coffee flavor.</p>
<p><b>Chocolate Mint</b>. Enough mint but not enough chocolate and coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Southern Pecan</strong>. Delicious. Pecan and coffee flavors well-balanced. I wonder: What does Northern Pecan taste like?</p>
<p><strong>Maya Chai</strong>. Tastes like chai. I would prefer, in addition, a dark coffee taste.</p>

<blockquote><p>Over the Thanksgiving [2012] holiday, I suggested to a relative, Richard, that he try the Shangri-la Diet. At the time I had heard about it but did not know anyone who had tried it. I did not have any particular reason to think it would work, but since Rich had tried a number of other diets (including low carb, which he is still following for the most part) I thought it would be worth a shot.</p>
<p>He started the diet over the Thanksgiving holiday and has kept it up since then with a few breaks. He lost 13 pounds in the first month and another 6 pounds over the next two weeks. Altogether he lost a total of 32 pounds over the 16 weeks following Thanksgiving, an average of 2 pounds per week. During this period, he traveled a fair amount and was not able to maintain the diet every day. However, he reported that one of his favorite things about the Shangri-la Diet is how easy it is to restart after a lapse. He began using extra light olive oil but has switched to walnut oil.</p>
<p>There were two surprising results other than the weight loss (which I think is exceptional in its own right). First, his blood sugar control has improved, even compared to the low carbohydrate diet he was (and still is) consuming. Second, he has been sleeping better at night due to a reduction in his nighttime appetite. I believe the two may be related &#8212; one of his medications for type 2 diabetes greatly increases his appetite and causes weight gain. He has been using much less of that medication because of his improved blood sugar on the Shangri-la Diet. Therefore, reduced appetite from the diet plus a reduction in an appetite-increasing medication results in lower nighttime appetite and therefore better sleep.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What prompted me to try SLD: When I first went paleo I dropped 30 pounds with no exercise or food restriction, but my weight has been stable for about a year. In January and February [2013] I went through a bad allergy spell, with my nose congested all the time. I dropped six pounds in that time. When the seasonal allergy went away, the weight came right back. Calories without smell suddenly look like a big factor.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf" target="_blank">My theory of weight control</a> predicts that eating unfamiliar food will cause weight loss. As food becomes familiar, we learn to associate its smell with its calories. Stronger smell-calorie associations produce a higher set point than weaker ones. Unfamiliar food has not yet gone through this learning process.</p>
<p>One way to eat unfamiliar food is to travel to another country. When I&#8217;ve done this, I&#8217;ve usually come home a few pounds lighter, supporting the prediction.</p>
<p>Another way is to have someone else choose what you&#8217;ll eat.  This is what <a href="http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2011/06/09/a-diet-of-diet-an-exercise-in-exercise/" target="_blank">Dan Goldstein did</a>. &#8220;I emailed my friend Dan Reeves, who has a fitness-expert sister named Melanie Reeves Wicklow, to request a healthy diet I could follow for seven days with no exceptions.&#8221; He thought of it as a diet where he would make no decisions about what to eat.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened on Day One:</p>
<blockquote><p>Discovered that if you eat oatmeal with an egg in it instead of just oatmeal, you feel full for much longer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened overall:</p>
<blockquote><p>I lost 15 pounds in about a couple months after the “no-decision” diet. (I lost no weight during the week of the diet).</p></blockquote>
<p>My explanation: During the week of the diet, he ate the specified amounts, which were more than he would have eaten based on hunger. This kept his weight up. During the following weeks, three things happened: 1. He resumed eating according to hunger. His lower set point caused lack of hunger, which caused less eating, which caused weight loss. 2. Because he ate less, his set point went down. 3. During the no-decision week, he picked up some new habits, causing him to eat less familiar food during the following weeks. He says that the no-decision week &#8220;changed his cravings&#8221; and caused him to &#8220;commit to eating better&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also says the no-decision week caused him to exercise more but no details are given. I doubt this made a difference. Few people lose 15 pounds in two months from exercise so minor that they don&#8217;t bother to describe it.</p>
<p>Thanks to Andrew Gelman.</p>

<p>From a trip to Japan a friend gave me a mystery jar of some sort of flavoring. It turned out to be wasabi-flavored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furikake" target="_blank">furikake</a>. Furikake is used to season rice, I learned. It vaguely resembles salt and pepper but is far more complex and powerful. A version I bought has 25 ingredients, including sesame, wheat flour, lactose, salt, MSG, salmon, fish bone powder, and soybean protein. I use it many ways: on roast beef, eggs, and yogurt, for example. It is the easiest way I know to make hamburgers taste good.</p>
<p>The nearest Japanese market (in Berkeley) has 25 different types, I discovered. They cost about $4 each. I bought four. I&#8217;m going to buy ten more, to use for <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=7063.0" target="_blank">crazy spicing</a> (randomly varying the smell of food to prevent strong smell-calorie associations from forming).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8367.msg107026#msg107026" target="_blank">a recent post on the Shangri-La Diet forums</a>, Morex, who lives in Mexico, describes several great side effects of the Shangri-La Diet:</p>
<p>1. <strong>At peace with food</strong>. &#8220;I am in control of what I eat. If I want I have a piece of chocolate or some peanuts, but food is no longer in command. Food is no longer an obstacle or an excuse. This is FANTASTIC! For 40 years I had a horrible relationship with food. It commanded my every activity in the day. I was always on the look for better flavors and foods that would quench my never fading hunger. This is no longer an issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. <strong>No more junk food</strong>. &#8220;Thanks to SLD, I quit junk food. I no longer crave it and when I have tasted it, it&#8217;s horrible! Too salty and greasy. Or too sweet. That means no soda, pizza, chips, donuts, candy or anything like that. When I want something sweet in the afternoon, I&#8217;d have a teaspoon of honey and that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. <strong>More money</strong>.  &#8221;We eat so little that we are saving extra cash. Who knows, maybe we could soon afford a nice vacation on the beach! (Vacations for Mexicans in Mexico are VERY expensive.)&#8221;</p>
<p>4. <strong>More time</strong>. Much more time. &#8220;Since we have been doing SLD, our days are longer! Because of the fact that we eat so very little portions, we are barely cooking. And when we do, it lasts for about 4 days! Before SLD we spent about an hour a meal. 30 mins. cooking, and 30 mins. eating. Some days it was longer, depending on what we cooked. That means that we spent about 3 or 4 hours a day cooking and eating. Now we prepare meals in about 10 minutes and eat in about 5!!! That&#8217;s right. For breakfast I have half a bran cookie, some cereal or some fruit. For lunch I just heat up in the microwave something we cooked. For dinner we have a little oatmeal or cereal. And that&#8217;s it! My days are longer for 3 hours! We have been reading our books (we&#8217;re book worms here), watching movies we didn&#8217;t have the time to watch and going out for walks!! FREAKING AWESOME!&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have the first two problems (loss of control and junk food) but I too distinctly noticed saving money and (especially) time. Just like he says. It&#8217;s been a long time since I wrote <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em> but I think I failed to mention how much time and money I saved. (If I&#8217;m wrong, please correct me.)</p>
<p>What about his weight? He doesn&#8217;t have a scale but says this: &#8220;Before SLD I was size 44. Today [after 2 months of SLD] I am 38, which I haven&#8217;t been able to wear since I was in the University (19 years old).&#8221; He wants to get to size 36. He also posts several pictures, before and after.</p>
<p>Thanks, Morex.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indianapolis man named Hugh, who goes by Nufftin on the Shangri-La Diet forums, has been <a href="http://permanentquivive.wordpress.com/category/ongoing-series/the-diet/">blogging about his weight loss</a> (including graphs) at increments of 10 pounds lost (he writes a post when he&#8217;s lost 10 pounds, 20 pounds, etc.). So far he&#8217;s lost more than 50 pounds and is close to his goal weight, which is near his weight in college.</p>
<p>I decided to read all the entries and note what I learned. He started more than a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>November 2011</strong>. He&#8217;s been gaining weight for a long time. He is about 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs more than 200 pounds, giving him a BMI in the 30s. He does not explain why he decided to try it. He has nice clothes that no longer fit.</p>
<p><strong>April 2012 (10 pounds down)</strong>. It took a long time to lose the first 10 pounds because he started just before Thanksgiving and Christmas, big eating holidays, and he gave up. He started again January 1 and gave up again. Then he started again in February. Daily weight spikes can be as much as 4 pounds (he weighs 4 pounds more on Tuesday than he did on Monday), but that only happened once (New Year&#8217;s Party?). After he becomes consistent with the diet (in February), the graph of his daily weights is enormously convincing that the diet works.</p>
<p><strong>May 2012 (20 pounds down). </strong>Here&#8217;s exactly how he does the diet: &#8220;a shot glass full of extra-light tasting olive oil in the morning, with no eating for an hour each side; two heaping tablespoons of table sugar dissolved in as much water as it will take to dissolve it in the evening.&#8221; (You can see why I would write a rather short book about such a diet.)  He also does 15 minutes of exercise most days but I won&#8217;t describe it in detail since it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter &#8212; he stops exercising but keeps losing weight. Some old clothes now fit again. Only two people have commented on his weight loss. Maybe everyone notices but intentional weight loss is so rare it could be he&#8217;s dying. (Which is what one of my Berkeley colleagues thought about my weight loss. He actually said, &#8220;Are you dying?&#8221;) No one wants to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>July 2012 (30 pounds down). </strong>The diet does require some effort. &#8220;I lost concentration for a couple of nights and, BOOM. To be fair, it was due to two great dinner parties (feta cheese hamburgers and The Descendants at one, Cuban sandwiches at the other).&#8221; These two &#8220;losses of concentration&#8221; did not have long-term effects. After 5-6 days &#8212; how long it took an unusually large amount of food to pass through his body and his salt balance to return to normal? &#8212; after those parties, his weight returned to its usual downward line.</p>
<p><strong>September 2012 (40 pounds down).</strong> One of his shirts is now too big for him. He gained 6 pounds during a two-week trip. The gained weight comes off quickly (in about a week) but this time there is a noticeable long-term effect: Weight loss resumes at the same rate as before but the function is shifted by two weeks. He stops his 15 minutes of exercise and nothing happens to his rate of weight loss.</p>
<p><strong>January 2013 (50 pounds down)</strong>. It has taken 15 months to lose 50 pounds. There was one serious plateau, from December 2012 to January 2013, where he did not lose weight. Almost all of his pants are too big. He can take off his shirt at the pool.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It simply <strong>cannot be</strong> that drinking sugar water causes weight loss. Sugar caused the obesity epidemic! It simply <strong>cannot be</strong> that eating fat will cause weight loss. Eating fat is why we&#8217;re fat! Everyone knows this. It simply <strong>cannot be</strong> that whether you smell a food while you eat it makes any difference. Weight loss is all about calories in, calories out.  The Shangri-La Diet says all three things are true. I cannot think of an historical precedent. Science has uncovered all sorts of unlikely stuff but nothing so surprising that is also immediately useful.</p>
<p>I thought of the Shangri-La Diet when I read <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112209/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs#" target="_blank">this description by Michael Lewis </a>of what Goldman Sachs has recently done:<span id="more-9234"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Stop and think once more about what has just happened on Wall Street: its most admired firm [Goldman Sachs] conspired to flood the financial system with worthless securities, then set itself up to profit from betting against those very same securities, and in the bargain helped to precipitate a world historic financial crisis that cost millions of people their jobs and convulsed our political system. In other places, or at other times, the firm would be put out of business, and its leaders shamed and jailed and strung from lampposts. (I am not advocating the latter.) Instead Goldman Sachs, like the other too-big-to-fail firms, has been handed tens of billions in government subsidies, on the theory that we cannot live without them. They were then permitted to pay politicians to prevent laws being passed to change their business, and bribe public officials (with the implicit promise of future employment) to neuter the laws that were passed—so that they might continue to behave in more or less the same way that brought ruin on us all.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The theory that we cannot live without them&#8221; was advocated by some of the most prestigious economists in the country.</p>
<p>What Goldman Sachs did &#8212; impossible-seeming, but it happened &#8212; is a sin of commission. Visible, at least to Michael Lewis, and capable of being pointed out (as Lewis does here) and marveled at.</p>
<p>The Shangri-La Diet seems like a bizarre thing, the diet from outer space, the crazy diet, whatever.  It can&#8217;t be true, but it is. Yet the Shangri-La Diet, strange as it sounds, is actually the only visible sign (at least, visible to many people) of a massive sin of omission: failure to do good research about health. Obesity has been a major health problem for a very long time, more than a hundred years, and an overwhelmingly large problem since about 1980, 30 years ago. Yet conventional thinking about it is so bad  &#8211; because mainstream research is so impotent &#8212; that people still take seriously ideas that date back to the 1950s and before, such as calories in calories out. A weight loss method discovered more than a hundred years old (cutting carbs) is still a big deal.  It is as if people were still marvelling at electricity.</p>
<p>The commonality of the two situations (Shangri-La Diet and Goldman Sachs) is that the people who are supposed to understand the world (health scientists in the case of SLD, economists in the case of Goldman Sachs) have in both cases so bungled their jobs that truly terrible things happened. In the case of SLD, the obesity epidemic happened. (Not to mention epidemics of depression, diabetes, auto-immune diseases, and so on. ) A slow-moving unmissable worldwide epidemic that has made hundreds of millions of people feel ashamed every time they look at themselves. In the case of Goldman Sachs, what happened was the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent poor recovery and the fact that the &#8220;solution&#8221; to the crisis left in place what had caused it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/19/what-doctors-wont-do" target="_blank">A link</a> from dearieme led me to <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e4026">a recent study</a> that found low-carb high-protein diets &#8212; presumably used to lose weight &#8212; associated with heart disease. The heart disease increase was substantial &#8212; as much as 60% in those with the most extreme diets. (A critic of the study, Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, called the increase in risk &#8220;<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e4026?tab=responses" target="_blank">incredibly small</a>&#8220;.) Four other studies of the same question have produced results consistent with this association. No study &#8212; at least, no study mentioned in the report &#8212; has produced results in the opposite direction (low-carb high-protein diets associated with a decrease in heart disease).</p>
<p>I find this interesting for several reasons.</p>
<p>1. I learned about the study from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/19/what-doctors-wont-do" target="_blank">a <em>Guardian</em> article</a> titled &#8220;What doctors won&#8217;t do&#8221;. A doctor named Tom Smith said, &#8220;I would never go on a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet like <a title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkins_diet">Atkins</a>, <a title="" href="http://www.dukandiet.co.uk/">Dukan</a> or <a title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cambridge_Diet">Cambridge</a>.&#8221; Fine. He didn&#8217;t say what he <strong>would</strong> do to lose weight. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/28/the-difference-between-being-fat-and-not-fat/" target="_blank">The psychological costs of obesity are huge</a>. The popularity of low-carb diets probably has a lot &#8212; or everything &#8212; to do with the failure of researchers to find something better. I have never seen people who criticize low-carb diets appear aware of this. I disagree with a lot of <em>Good Calories Bad Calories</em> but I completely agree with its criticism of researchers.<span id="more-8907"></span></p>
<p>2. There has never been a good explanation of the success of low-carb high-protein diets (why they cause weight loss), although this has been well-known for more than a century. (A good explanation would be a theory that made predictions that turned out to be true.) Such diets require a big change in what you eat. A big change is likely to have big health consequences in addition to the weight loss, and those side effects could be either good or bad. It now appears bad is more likely.  With a good theory of weight control, you should be able to find a much smaller change that produces the same amount of weight loss as a low-carb high-protein diet. Because the change is much smaller, it should have much smaller side effects. Much smaller side effects (unknown whether they are good or bad) are much less likely, if bad, to outweigh the benefits of the weight loss. I have never come across a low-carb advocate who seemed to understand this (that we don&#8217;t know why they work and it would be a very good idea to find out).</p>
<p>3. The Japanese are remarkably healthy (live very long), slim, and have very little heart disease, yet eat lots of rice. Which makes absurd the notion that all high-carb diets are unhealthy or fattening.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e4026?tab=responses">The comments on the low-carb study</a> are mostly critical and the criticisms are terrible. For example, Dr. Yoni Friedhoff, who <a href="http://www.weightymatters.ca/" target="_blank">blogs about weight control</a>, says, &#8220;The paper&#8217;s basing all of its 15 years worth of conclusions off of a single, solitary, and clearly inaccurate, baseline food frequency questionnaire&#8221;. The authors of the study correctly reply that inaccuracy would reduce the associations.</p>
<p>5. Until nutrition scientists do better research, our best source of nutritional guidance may be what we like to eat. Evolution shaped us to like foods that are good for us, at least under ancient conditions. We like carbs and we don&#8217;t like foods high in protein (lean meat is barely edible) so a low-carb high-protein diet is on its face a bad idea.  This is why I find it plausible that the low-carb high-protein association with heart disease reflects cause and effect (low-carb high-protein causes heart disease) and that in particular a high-protein diet causes heart disease. (Too little of the right fats?) We very much like fat. Under ancient conditions, the fat people ate was mostly animal fat and, before that, if you believe in aquatic apes, fish oil. It is quite plausible that lactose tolerance spread so quickly throughout the world because at the time everybody was starved of animal fat &#8212; high-fat mammals had been hunted to extinction &#8212; and dairy products were a good source of it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/forum/thread74412.html" target="_blank">A long thread at Mark&#8217;s Daily Apple</a> may be the best introduction to the Shangri-La Diet. It is dramatic (people object, people say the diet is crazy), varied (many voices, many sorts of data), responsive to feedback (questions and objections are answered) and no doubt more convincing than my book (because it isn&#8217;t by me). The helpful elements include:</p>
<p>1.  An introductory success story (from a woman named heatseeker) that I have<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/02/success-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank"> already blogged about</a>.</p>
<p>2. Someone makes a common Paleo objection &#8212; it works because of macronutrient ratios. &#8220;You have stumbled on the perfect macro ratios for you!&#8221; Heatseeker says this is unlikely because she barely changed her macro ratios. She answers many other questions and objections (e.g., &#8220;how do you choke down the coconut oil?&#8221;).</p>
<p>3. Someone says it didn&#8217;t work for them (&#8220;neither did anything else&#8221;).<span id="more-8876"></span></p>
<p>4.  Link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?client=mv-google&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;v=2oPEeddjEP8&amp;nomobile=1" target="_blank">a talk by me </a> (&#8220;You Had Me at Bacon&#8221;) that puts the diet in the context of my other work, such as the effect of pork fat on sleep.</p>
<p>5. Link to <a href="http://www.astrocyte-design.com/shangri-la-diet/index.html" target="_blank">Alex Chernavsky&#8217;s results</a>, which are most impressive <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">in context</a>.</p>
<p>6. Emphasis that the flavorless calories can be anything so long as they are flavorless (i.e., have no smell, which can be achieved by eating them nose-clipped). As heatseeker says, she lost weight via flavorless fat, I lost weight via flavorless sugar, so the success cannot be due to the fat. It is more complicated than that.</p>
<p>7. A confident naysayer: &#8220;I started eating less and now I&#8217;m lean for life. It really is that simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>8. Link to <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf" target="_blank">a scientific paper by me about the underlying theory</a>.</p>
<p>9. Heatseeker says: &#8220;I would say that after four years of eating according to TPB [<em>The Primal Blueprint</em> by Mark Sisson], and 2-3 years of really strict adherence, absolutely every promise made by Mark came true&#8211;EXCEPT the fat loss.&#8221; That Diet X works better than a credible alternative (in this case, TPB) is more interesting than the observation that it works better than nothing.</p>
<p>10. A link to me talking about &#8220;<a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/420283/28918924" target="_blank">what food makes my brain work best</a>&#8220;. More context.</p>
<p>11. &#8220;Has been incredibly easy to follow, even while at work,&#8221; says someone who is not heatseeker.</p>
<p>12. Independent discovery: &#8220;38 years ago our gym teacher had one of the overweight girls (we had 2) in gym class doing this! By the time we hit our Christmas break she had lost most of her pudge!! This is a true story. I remember because the girl&#8217;s parents were not informed and the gym teacher almost got fired for &#8216;experimenting&#8217; on the said pupil. What saved her was people finding out that the girl had been caught by the teacher barfing up her lunch in an effort to lose weight (bulimic) so to keep her from going down that path and to gain her trust as a confidant etc she helped her by showing her a method she herself had used to control hunger which was eating a fat source between meals. Fantastic eh??? I had never heard anything quite like this until I read this thread.&#8221;</p>
<p>13. Bonus side effect: &#8220;Last night I slept through the night! Completely! I did not even slightly stir for any reason. . . . I have not slept through the night in YEARS!!!!!!&#8221; More reason to think that lack of certain fats impairs sleep.</p>
<p>14. Psychological effect: &#8220;What is happening here with the SLD? I feel calm and neutral to food.&#8221; You may remember <a href="http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_25-editionID_210-ArticleID_1997" target="_blank">research that suggested self-control is like a muscle</a>. One similarity is the more you use it the stronger it gets. Several people have said that as soon as they started SLD, they were able to overcome other addictions, such as smoking and coffee. Maybe this is because years of struggling with food, day after day, had left them with very strong self-control. Before SLD, their self-control was exhausted pushing away urges to eat.  As soon as SLD got rid of those urges, their very strong self control made it easy to quit smoking or whatever.</p>
<p>15. Two reluctant yea-sayers: &#8220;I coincidentally started trying this as a gesture of support for a desperate friend of mine . . . The whole concept is ludicrous and it&#8217;s probably just placebo effect . . . I&#8217;m kind of embarrassed to admit that this has worked for me. 10 lbs down&#8221; (Person 1). &#8220;If there weren&#8217;t so many people saying this works for them, I&#8217;d think it was the stupidest thing in the world&#8221; (Person 2).</p>

<blockquote><p>I hesitated to post a thread about this because I feel like these forums have been overrun with &#8220;fad&#8221; diets and hacks lately&#8211;and because it&#8217;s honestly so bizarre-sounding that I feel a little silly admitting it&#8211;but my success on the Shangri-La Diet has been such that I felt I should share. I&#8217;ve had serious body fat setpoint issues since, oh, college, I guess&#8211;six years&#8211;and after watching my setpoint slowly creep up throughout my 20s with absolutely NOTHING making any difference, I&#8217;m finally losing weight steadily. I&#8217;ve lost 13lb and it&#8217;s still coming off like clockwork. Nothing else in my diet or exercise regimes changed, and I&#8217;ve experienced no strength losses (I&#8217;ve continued to make gains, actually).</p>
<p>I use refined coconut oil, 2tbsp/day. I was using unrefined at first but the flavor was too strong.</p>
<p>Has anyone else done the SLD, and had success? I just felt like I should spread the word, because I know there are some other setpoint-challenged people on these forums, and this has been a big breakthrough for me.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have recently encountered three examples that suggest low-carb diets don&#8217;t work well long-term:</p>
<p>1. Alex Chernavsky <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">tried a low-carb diet in 2002</a>. Starting at 270 pounds, he lost 70 pounds. A year later, he started to rapidly regain the lost weight. He stopped the diet.</p>
<p>2. A &#8220;medical professional&#8221; <a href="http://www.livinlowcarbdiscussion.com/showthread.php?tid=9606" target="_blank">started at about 260 pounds</a> (she&#8217;s 5&#8217;3&#8243;).  After reading <em>Wheat Belly,</em> she gave up wheat. &#8220;After several months of being wheat free I lost 10 lbs. But that&#8217;s where it stopped.&#8221; Then she did  full low-carb. &#8220;From May to July I did what basically was Atkins induction. I lost 20 lbs but then the weight loss stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/" target="_blank">Jimmy Moore</a> lost a lot of weight eating low-carb. Starting in 2004 at 410 pounds, he lost 180 pounds. Then he gained half of it back, ending up near 300 pounds in early 2012. <span id="more-8463"></span></p>
<p>The theory behind the Shangri-La Diet (SLD) says unfamiliar food will cause weight loss because its smell is not (yet) associated with calories. As the food becomes familiar, its smell becomes associated with calories. Weight loss due to unfamiliarity will disappear. Going low-carb usually involves eating unfamiliar foods. They become familiar. This explains low-carb weight regain. The theory explains partial low-carb success (e.g., Jimmy Moore didn&#8217;t regain all the lost weight) by assuming that the high-carb foods (e.g., soft drinks) given up produced stronger smell-calorie associations than the low-carb foods (e.g., steak) that replaced them.</p>
<p>Recently Jimmy Moore <a href="http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/blog/n1" target="_blank">has been losing weight again</a>. Starting at 306 pounds, over 7 months he has lost 60 pounds. He believes that to lose weight with a low-carb diet, there must be sufficient ketones in your blood &#8212; you must be at the optimal level of ketosis. &#8220;In order to be fully keto-adapted and to start burning stored body fat for fuel, ketone levels must be between 0.5 to 3.0 millimolar,&#8221; he wrote. To be fully keto-adapted, he began measuring his ketone level regularly.  His first test showed that his ketone level was 0.3. &#8220;Holy cow, that could be one of the reasons why I’m not seeing my weight go down!&#8221; he wrote. He began adjusting his diet to put his ketone level between 0.5 and 3.0 millimolar, which involved changing protein intake as well as carb intake.</p>
<p>He changed his diet in various ways (mainly protein reduction) and started losing weight. In what I&#8217;ve read, he does not describe his current diet or earlier diet in detail,  but does <a href="http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/blog/jimmy-moores-n1-experiments-nutritional-ketosis-day-1-30/14409" target="_blank">say this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I will tell you that I’ve drank liberal amounts of water and 2 Tbs Carlson’s liquid fish oil daily along with my regular daily vitamins during this experiment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which sounds exactly like the Shangri-La Diet. Alex Chernavsky lost considerable weight and has kept it off <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">doing almost the same thing with flaxseed oil</a>.</p>
<p>My guess is that he is losing weight because of the fish oil. The theory behind SLD makes two predictions: 1. If Jimmy stops the fish oil and continues the ketone level adjustment, he will stop losing weight. 2. If Jimmy stops the ketone level adjustment but continues the fish oil, he will continue losing weight.</p>
<p>I asked Jimmy for comment. Here&#8217;s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s an interesting theory, but not one I want to particularly test out since I&#8217;m still doing so well at accomplishing what I am aiming for right now&#8211;fat loss, mental acuity and great overall health [all due to the fish oil, I believe -- Seth]. Perhaps once this period of testing NK [nutritional ketosis] is over in May, I can add in your suggestion as another testing point.</p></blockquote>
<p>The theory behind low-carb dieting has never made any correct predictions, as far as I know. It does not explain why the lost weight is often regained. If it turns out Jimmy Moore&#8217;s weight loss is due to his ketone adjustment, that will be the first correct prediction of the theory.</p>
<p>In contrast, the theory behind SLD led me to five new ways to lose weight (eating bland food, eating slowly-digested food, drinking unflavored sugar water, drinking oil with no smell, eating food nose-clipped). That&#8217;s roughly the same as  five correct predictions, two of them (drinking sugar water, drinking oil with no smell) counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>Jimmy Moore&#8217;s weight loss may eventually show you can lose weight via SLD even when you don&#8217;t realize you&#8217;re doing SLD.</p>
