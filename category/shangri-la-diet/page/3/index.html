<li>The Shangri-La Diet: <strong>still</strong> <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111005151654AAX8TLC">too good to be true</a>. It was my dream &#8212; and maybe every scientist&#8217;s dream &#8212; to discover something (a) useful and (b) counter-intuitive, the more surprising the better. It did not occur to me that (a) and (b) conflict. I think that more surprising discoveries are eventually more useful (as logic suggests), but it takes much longer.</li>
<li>Marisa Tomei <a href="http://www.toronto.com/article/700440--marisa-tomei-gets-political">wants to play Jane Jacobs</a>. &#8220;I love that she saved Greenwich Village.&#8221; When she does, perhaps Robert Caro will post the unpublished Jane Jacobs chapter of <em>The Power Broker</em>.</li>

<li>Did you know that Mindy Kaling&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2011/10/03/111003sh_shouts_kaling">amusing article in this week&#8217;s <em>New Yorker</em></a> is <a href="http://blog.moviefone.com/2011/09/26/mindy-kaling-new-yorker-excerpt/">an excerpt from a forthcoming book</a>? Neither did I. Likewise, the recent Murakami story <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2011/09/05/110905fi_fiction_murakami">Town of Cats</a> was from a forthcoming book. <em>The New Yorker</em>, unlike other magazines, never identifies book excerpts. This  is unfortunate because doing so would help both writers (sell books) and readers (find books to read). For more criticism of  <em>The New Yorker</em>, see the great book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gone-Last-Days-New-Yorker/dp/0684808161"><em>Gone</em>: <em>The Last Days of The New Yorker</em> by Renata Adler</a>.</li>

					<p><a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8178.msg104939#msg104939">This person</a> has been doing the Shangri-La Diet (SLD) for two weeks:</p>
<blockquote><p>The appetite suppression is now strong. Yesterday I went to dinner at one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. Ordered my favorite meal there.  I could only eat about 1/3 of my favorite dish and a few chips and salsa. . . .. That is nothing short of amazing. The best part is: it satisfied me. I would normally eat the whole meal and not be satisfied, I would be able to eat more. I wouldn&#8217;t normally eat more, but I could eat more. Not this time. Didn&#8217;t want more.</p></blockquote>
<p>He eats about 700 calories/day nose-clipped &#8212; that&#8217;s his version of the diet. Before he started the diet he was gaining 10 pounds every year. When he started SLD, he weighed 250 pounds at 5 feet 10 inches tall (BMI =  36).</p>
<p>If I were to write <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em> all over again I would emphasize nose-clipping. You can easily eat lots of smell-free yet healthy calories nose-clipped and get great appetite suppression, as in this case. That&#8217;s one reason the book is short. I wanted to get the idea out in the world soon, so other people could help improve it. That&#8217;s what happened. Nose-clipping was someone else&#8217;s idea (Gary Skaleski, 2006), not mine. It was a better application of my theory and early findings (e.g., sugar water causes weight loss) than I was capable of. Now, thanks to the Internet, I can find out what happens when people do the new improved version.</p>

					<p>From <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8186.0">the Shangri-La Diet forums</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I started this process on or around the 3rd week of July. Not sure of the exact date lets say 7-23-11. Weight was 228 lbs, blood pressure maxing out at 160/100. Today (9-30-11) my weight is 195 lbs and the bp is below 120/80.</p>
<p>So in 10 weeks I have dropped 33 lbs about 3.3 pounds a week or half a pound a day. My goal weight is 175. I have done the canola oil twice a day. No breakfast and mixing in salad and fruit for lunch and dinner with 6 ounces of meat, seafood or chicken. Some carbs but not a lot. I have not had any cravings to overeat or to snack on junk food and I just stopped drinking sodas for no reason that I can explain and I don&#8217;t feel hungry after meals.</p>
<p>People at the gym must think I am sick because I am losing weight and don&#8217;t do very much. I lift 20 minutes to maintain what I have and ran twice in the past 10 weeks for a total of maybe 3 miles. I have started doing more abs now that you might be able to see them when all the fat is gone.</p>
<p>In 30 years of dieting this is the easiest thing I have ever done. I don&#8217;t understand why this isn&#8217;t the number one diet in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let it not be because I don&#8217;t blog about it. <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=7776.msg104927#msg104927">Someone else, who started at 321 pounds, has lost 67 pounds in 8 months</a>. Graph <a href="http://www.tickerfactory.com/weight-loss/wRled2g/">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have just been doing the flaxseed oil for a few days and I am experiencing a dramatic decrease of my arthritis pain! It is a wonderful benefit. . . . My doctor friend who told me about the SLD told me that the flaxseed oil would help my arthritis as well, but I never expected anything this dramatic or quick!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/10/28/advances-in-the-shangri-la-diet/">A friend of mine noticed something similar</a>: his sore back stopped hurting shortly after he started taking flaxseed oil. If he skipped a day or so, the pain returned. <strong>Update</strong>: Reminded of this, he said, &#8220;I had forgotten all about that. When people ask me how my back is I tell them it never bothers me anymore since I stopped going to the gym.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: At first the arthritis sufferer took 4 1200-mg capsules 3 times/day &#8212; that is, 12 capsules per day. Then she increased her dosage to 6 capsules 3 times/day (= 18 capsules/day).</p>
<p><strong>Update 3</strong>. &#8221; Yesterday, I was off to work and could not find my oil capsules.  I didn&#8217;t have time to look for them, so I resigned myself to doing sugar water during the day.  . . .  I did notice a small but significant worsening of the pain in my knees.  When I got home, I found the capsules, and began taking them again.  By the time I woke up this morning, I noted that my knees are again feeling better.&#8221;</p>

				<small>Monday, July 25th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/19brody.html?pagewanted=all">A new longitudinal study</a> finds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite conventional advice to eat less fat, <strong>weight loss was greatest among people who ate more yogurt and nuts, including peanut butter</strong>, over each four-year period. . . .</p>
<p>That yogurt, among all foods, was most strongly linked to weight loss was the study’s most surprising dietary finding, the researchers said. Participants who ate more yogurt [than the average for all participants?] lost an average of 0.82 pound every four years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why might this be? </p>
<p>Yogurt and peanut butter are both unusual foods. Yogurt is strange because unflavored yogurt has little or no smell. It tastes good for other reasons: strong sourness, creaminess, and coolness. People are also pushed to eat it not only by how pleasant it is to eat but by the thought that it is good for them. Most foods, in the form that we eat them, have a smell. I explain the yogurt results by saying that yogurt consumption replaced consumption of foods with stronger smells.</p>
<p>Peanut butter is unusual because when I was visiting publishers to sell <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>, I met a woman who told me she had lost weight simply by eating peanut butter &#8212; that is, by adding peanut butter to the rest of her diet, making no other changes. I think she ate about 3 tablespoons per day. This predisposed her to think there might be something to my ideas. No one has ever told me such a story about another food. If peanut butter has a smell, it&#8217;s really weak. It&#8217;s pleasant to eat because of fat content and texture. When I was a boy, my mom made me peanut butter sandwiches (no jam) for school lunch. I never came to like them. This implies I never learned a smell-calorie association. The bread must have supplied a strong fast calorie signal so this implies that the peanut butter generated little or no smell signal.</p>

The record begins with a switch to a vegan diet. Over three months he lost seven pounds but gradually regained the lost weight, even though his diet didn&#8217;t change. In the middle he suddenly gained five pounds on a trip to Alaska and Seattle and then gradually lost it.</p>
<p>He describes his diet like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: georgia,serif;">My diet was pretty average Midwestern meat and potatoes sort of thing prior to going vegan-ish, and I emphasize the <em>ish</em>.  I&#8217;ve been vegan-ish since I started tracking weight, meaning that I  don&#8217;t buy meat or dairy products at the store, but I&#8217;ll happily eat  whatever sounds good off of a restaurant menu or whatever is being  served when I&#8217;m eating at someone else&#8217;s place. I intentionally keep my diet very boring. I eat an absurd amount of peanuts and  raisins, I estimate in the range of 600 &#8211; 900 calories per day. Besides peanuts and raisins, most of my  calories come from lentils, frozen vegetables, and bread + olive oil. I  drink almost exclusively water, with a few swigs of OJ most days, and  have a glass of wine or a bottle of beer on occasion. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: georgia,serif;">The features of this data that interest me are (a) weight loss when he changed what he ate (first three months) and (b) gradual regain of the lost weight (after that). Few theories of weight control can explain the regain. However, <a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">the theory behind the Shangri-La Diet</a> can. It says that he initially lost weight because he shifted to foods with relatively weak flavor-calorie associations &#8212; weak because the foods were relatively new. As he ate them again and again, the flavor-calorie associations got stronger and this raised his set point.<br />

					<p>When <em>The Shangri-La Diet </em>was published (2006), I enjoyed checking its Amazon rank. The rank got worse. I checked less often. Eventually it was usually above 100,000 and I barely checked at all.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I noticed it was much better than I expected &#8212; maybe 40,000. <em>How did that happen?</em> Were sales improving? To find out, I subscribed to RankTracer, which records Amazon rank every hour and plots the results. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/10/the-curious-amazon-rank-of-the-shangri-la-diet/#more-3015" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Thursday, June 9th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3009971/">A 2010 study</a> (via <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/">Whole Health Source</a>) compared a Paleo diet with a Mediterranean diet. For twelve weeks, twenty-nine volunteers could eat as much as they wanted, whenever they wanted. Half ate Paleo (&#8220;lean meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, root vegetables, eggs, and nuts&#8221;), half Mediterranean (&#8220;whole grains, low-fat dairy products, vegetables, fruit, fish, and oils and margarines&#8221;).</p>
<p>The main result was that the Paleo food was &#8220;more satiating per calorie&#8221;. The Paleo eaters ate less but no more often than Mediterranean eaters. The paper does not report weight loss. (See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17583796">an earlier report</a> of the same experiment for that.)</p>
<p>I suspect the Paleo diet was less familiar than the Mediterranean diet (of course I can&#8217;t be sure from the descriptions). <a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">My theory of weight control</a> says familiarity matters: less-familiar food pushes your set point lower than familiar food because its smell-calorie associations are weaker. The smells of less-familiar food is less associated with calories than the smells of more familiar food. With a lower set point, you will need less food to feel full.</p>
<p>If familiarity matters, this causes big problems for clinical studies. It means that short-term results (e.g., after 6 months) may be quite different than long-term results (e.g., after 2 years) &#8212; and most clinical trials last about six months. Short term, says my theory, any new food will cause weight loss. Indeed, a wide range of diets that cause dieters to eat new foods, such as the cabbage soup diet, cause short-term weight loss. Over the long term, however, the new foods become familiar and, according to my theory, the set point goes back up as the new smell-calorie associations are learned. Indeed, on most diets there is great long-term weight regain. If familiarity matters, we need data sets lasting a long time (e.g., <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/05/07/nine-years-of-weights-more-shangri-la-success/">nine</a> or <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/04/22/ten-years-of-weight-measurements/">ten</a> years) to understand weight control. Such data sets allow enough time for the chosen diets to become familiar so that (a) the diets being compared are equal in familiarity and (b) we can see their long-term effects &#8212; which may easily be different from their short-term effects.</p>

					<p>After having guests over for dinner, my friend Carl Willat realized he had the ingredients for a root-beer float: Haagen-Daz vanilla ice cream and A&amp;W root beer. He hadn&#8217;t thought about root beer floats in years.  He made one. The next day he made another one. He ran out of root beer, bought some more. The day after that, another one. They seemed to taste better and better each day. He ran out of ice cream, bought some more. The next day, another root-beer float. The next day, another one. Toward the end of the week, he found himself thinking: <em>When am I going to have one tomorrow? </em>He had to force himself to stop buying ice cream and root beer, and after a while he didn&#8217;t think about them anymore.</p>
<p>At the heart of <a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">the theory behind the Shangri-La Diet</a> is the idea that we learn to associate flavors (more precisely, smells) with calories. Here is a vivid example.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed this learning with liquor. A few months ago I bought my first bottle of rum &#8212; to flavor yogurt. Sometimes I drank the rum without yogurt, and it tasted better and better.</p>

					<p>Pat McGee of Grand Prairie, Texas, learned about the Shangri-La Diet last week and realized the theory behind it explained something strange that had happened to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>A couple of years ago I unpacked my scale and was astonished to see that  I had lost 25 lbs sometime in the couple of years before that. [He went from 165-170 pounds to 140-146 pounds. He is 5 feet 8 inches tall.] I was  mystified as to why, as I could point to no changes in anything I  thought might be relevant in my life.</p>
<p>Last week, I found out about the SLD and read the first few chapters  of the book. I realized that about three years ago, I had switched from  sodas [with sugar, such as Coke and Pepsi] to weak iced tea. I did this mostly because I was feeling cheap  and didn&#8217;t feel like paying for bottled sodas any more. I use 5 small  teabags and a cup of sugar per gallon, steeped for about 6 minutes with a  little lemon juice. Basically I want something that&#8217;s got just enough  flavor that it&#8217;s not plain water.</p></blockquote>
<p>When you are 5&#8217;8&#8243; and 170 pounds, losing 25 pounds without trying (from BMI 26 to 22) <strong>is </strong>astonishing. Not only that, he has kept it off. His story is a little different than mine because I didn&#8217;t stop drinking anything &#8212; certainly nothing as fattening as Coke or Pepsi.</p>
<p>Here is a new use of the ideas behind the Shangri-La Diet &#8212; namely, identifying what caused massive accidental weight loss. Obviously others can use his discovery. From a theoretical point of view, he replaced strongly-flavored drinks with a weakly-flavored one. According to conventional ideas about weight control, this should have no effect.</p>
<p>It is also an interesting example of behavioral engineering because he switched from standard soft drinks (such as Pepsi) to his concoction without difficulty. His drink was pleasant enough. It derived pleasure from flavor (tea), sweetness (sugar), and sourness (lemon juice). A little salt would have allowed him to reduce the flavor even more.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, May 4th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Darwin was an insider/outsider; so was Mendel. Insider/outsiders are close enough to their subject to have a good understanding and skills yet far enough away to have freedom. In the case of Chinese history, <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2010/dec/20/finding-facts-about-maos-victims/">a journalist named Yang Jisheng has filled that role</a>. He wrote a book called <em>Tombstone (Mubei) </em>about the Great Famine (1958-61). He was able to write what professional historians could not:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Why are you the first Chinese historian to tackle this subject seriously?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Traditional historians [i.e., college professors] face restrictions. First of all, they censor  themselves. Their thoughts limit them. They don’t even dare to write the  facts, don’t dare to speak up about it, don’t dare to touch it. And  even if they wrote it, they can’t publish it. And if they publish, they  will face censure. So mainstream scholars face those restrictions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But there are many unofficial historians like me. Many people are  writing their own memoirs about being labeled “Rightists” or  “counter-revolutionaries.” There is an author in Anhui province who has  described how his family starved to death. There are many authors who  have written about how their families starved.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they publish, they will face censure.&#8221; With respect to weight control, I am an insider/outsider. When I published <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>, I did not expect censure. My colleagues (other psychology department faculty)  wouldn&#8217;t care what I wrote about a different subject. To my surprise, I <em>was </em>censured &#8212; maybe a better word is <em>denounced</em> &#8212; by a nutrition education lecturer in the UC Berkeley Nutrition Department.  The woman who denounced me had not seen my book. Based on what a reporter told her, she expressed her opinion of it in an email she sent to twenty people in her department and the chairman of my department. It said, in part:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I did give the SF Chronicle reporter my opinion of the diet making these points:<br />
- one cannot possibly meet nutrient needs on 1200 kcals per day<br />
- sugar and oils are not nutrient dense; they are calorically dense and  thus dilute the nutrient density of the total kcal intake.<br />
- 1200 kcals per day is less than the semi-starvation diet used in the  only published formal study ever conducted in this country on human  starvation (Ancel Keys, 1950)<br />
- human semi-starvation is not a path to health whether one is discussing physical, psychological, or social well-being<br />
- the results of single subject research are applicable only to that subject; they cannot be generalized to others.<br />
- I cannot recommend this diet, in fact, I recommend against it.</p>
<p>In other words: Ridiculous. Her many misconceptions (e.g., she is unaware of many examples of path-breaking self-experimentation in the field of nutrition)  aren&#8217;t terribly interesting. What&#8217;s fascinating is her decision to trash a book she hasn&#8217;t read to a large number of her colleagues.</p>

				<small>Monday, May 2nd, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Demand pricing (also called dynamic pricing) is adjusting the price according to demand. More demand, higher price. It is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-fi-lazarus-20110426,0,6480866.column">being considered for movie tickets</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If a movie is hot, the price could rise to whatever the market will bear. For example, I&#8217;d have paid $20 per ticket to see &#8220;Avatar&#8221; in 3-D when it first opened; maybe others would have been willing to pay even more. As demand becomes clear through lower ticket sales, prices would drop. So &#8220;Avatar&#8221; might cost $15 a few weeks after opening, gradually making its way to $10.</p></blockquote>
<p>The theory behind the Shangri-La Diet says that body fat is adjusted in a similar way. When food is abundant, the set point (which controls how much fat you have) goes up (= you store more fat). When food is scarce, the set point goes down. This is how many storage systems work, of course; they increase the amount stored when the price is low and decrease the amount stored when the price is high.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day weight control will be explained to children by telling them it is like the price of airplane tickets: &#8220;When more people want to go to Los Angeles, the price goes up. When more food is available, your set point goes up . . . &#8220;</p>

					<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2011-04-20-more-Alex-Chernavsky-weight3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2471" title="2011-04-20 more Alex Chernavsky weight" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2011-04-20-more-Alex-Chernavsky-weight3-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="325" /></a></p>
<p>For ten years Alex Chernavsky has measured and recorded his weight (above). I asked what he learned from this. Here&#8217;s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I started the tracking because I thought that the very act of measuring (and recording) my weight every day would inspire me to lose weight.  I don&#8217;t think it really worked that way, though.  In order to lose weight, I had to take active measures.</p>
<p>What did I learn?  I learned that low-carb diets work well in the short-run (as you said), and I also learned that eating low-carb is far, far easier than eating a calorie-restricted diet (which I&#8217;ve tried in the past, before I began recording my weight daily).  I learned that regular exercise does lead to weight loss, although I can&#8217;t rule out a possible confounding factor:  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it turned out that I changed my eating habits at the same time that I started an exercise regime.  That&#8217;s probably what Gary Taubes would claim.</p>
<p>I also learned that the Shangr-La diet works well for me.  I think that the current upward trend is caused  (at least in part) by the fact that I&#8217;m eating breakfast more and more often. I didn&#8217;t start eating breakfast until sometime last autumn.  I will try eliminating breakfast again to see if it reverses the trend.  I must say, though, that it&#8217;s a little difficult to watch my wife eating some scrumptious morning meal while I just drink coffee.  The temptation is hard to resist.</p>
<p>I also learned that my weight fluctuates for no apparent reason at all.  If you look at the period of roughly April 20, 2008 through mid-July 2008, you&#8217;ll see a drop of about ten pounds.  I remember being surprised and puzzled during this time, because I could not think of any plausible reason why this weight loss would occur.  I still don&#8217;t know.  In any case, it was short-lived. </p>
<p>I also learned that I should have kept much better notes about what was going on during those ten years.  I&#8217;m kicking myself now.  I plan on continuing to collect data, and I will try to annotate the data better in the future.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alex Chernavsky, whose Shangri-La Diet experience <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/27/15-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/">I described recently</a>, has recorded his weight for almost ten years, with the results shown in this graph. During that period, he&#8217;s changed his diet and exercise several times. </p>
<p>The first change was to a low-carb diet (Atkins-like, with lots of meat and fat). He made this change after reading Gary Taubes&#8217;s <em>New York Times</em> article &#8220;What If It&#8217;s Been A Big Fat Lie?&#8221;. As advertised, the low-carb diet caused him to lose a lot of weight but &#8212; not as advertised &#8212; after about a year he started to regain the lost weight. For other reasons, he changed to a vegetarian and later a vegan diet. They slowed down the weight regain but did not stop it. In 2005 and 2006 he managed by walking a lot &#8212; in 2006, 90 minutes/day or more 5 or 6 days every week &#8212; to lose almost 30 pounds, but then his weight resumed creeping upward. Then he lost about 30 pounds due to the Shangri-La Diet. He did the diet by drinking 3.5 tablespoons of flaxseed oil instead of lunch. He drank a glass of water afterwards to get rid of the flavor.</p>
<p>I have never seen a weight record this long. It suggests several interesting points:</p>
<p>1. A low-carb diet, as advertised, quickly produces substantial weight loss.</p>
<p>2. Not as advertised, the weight loss is followed by regain after a year or so. This implies that studies of low-carb diets and weight loss need to last several years to give a clear picture of how much weight loss to expect.</p>
<p>3. Low-intensity long-duration exercise (walking for 90 minutes almost daily) causes substantial weight loss. This isn&#8217;t surprising.</p>
<p>4. &#8230; but it is surprising the effects of the exercise appeared to last at least a few years after the exercise was stopped. I have never seen this reported.</p>
<p>5. The Shangri-La Diet worked well. Alex did the diet somewhat differently than other people so it was not obvious this would be true.</p>
<p>6. After he stopped losing weight on SLD, his rate of weight gain was roughly the same as his rate of gain before he started the diet.</p>

					<p>On <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/personal-science/201104/the-shangri-la-diet-why-no-revolution">my Psychology Today blog</a> someone left a surprising comment about why the Shangri-La Diet isn&#8217;t more popular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seth, I&#8217;ll tell you why. Because we are majorly competitive bitches, we women who care about our appearance. I&#8217;m 41, I have three children and I am a size 6. I fit into my wedding dress and the jeans I wore in college. How? Shangri-La. And there is no way in hell I am going to share my secret with anyone.</p>
<p>Went to the movies this weekend with a group of friends. They had the usual movie fare, I ordered a cup of tea (bag on the side), added two tablespoons of sugar (put the teabag in my purse for later), sipped it slowly throughout the movie, had not ONE craving for the popcorn or nachos or M&amp;M&#8217;s everyone else was scarfing. I went home and had a light dinner and felt terrific!</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds more like an ad than an actual comment, but it could hardly be more vivid and I believe it.</p>

				<small>Monday, April 11th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>On the <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/">Shangri-La Diet forums </a>I found a link to this:<br />
<img title="Weight Chart" src="http://tickers.tickerfactory.com/WeightPlot/wdOfPGk.png" border="0" alt="Weight Chart" /></p>
<p><a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=7713.0">A middle-aged man named Kainin</a> has lost about 60 pounds since September (7 months) and described his experience in great detail. On Weight Watchers, he lost 40 pounds in 6 months before gaining it all back (plus 10 pounds more) &#8212; he started at 290, went down to 250, and back up to 300. On Nutrisystems, he lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks before gaining it all back. So the Shangri-La Diet has already helped him more than those two methods, not to mention being easier.</p>
<p>At the end of February, his BMI went below 35, the level indicating Morbid Obesity.</p>
<blockquote><p>To celebrate I went to the local party store to look for a mylar balloon saying something like &#8220;Congratulations on being just Obese!&#8221; but found &#8212; NOTHING! The closest I found was a bereavement balloon that read &#8220;Sorry for your Loss&#8221;. Not exactly what I was looking for.</p></blockquote>
<p>The roughly 100,000 posts on the SLD forums make the case for the diet far better than I ever could. Now, if I could just get rid of spammers &#8230;</p>
