				<small>Friday, December 21st, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A good way to do the Shangri-La Diet is to drink flaxseed oil between meals. It pushes down your setpoint and also supplies omega-3. Alex Chernavsky, for example, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">has had success with this</a>. You will probably want to make the flaxseed oil smell-less. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<blockquote><p>I read something on Amazon by one of the people who reviewed your book and it&#8217;s worked for me. I take a small sip of water and keep it in my mouth and then take the tablespoon [of flaxseed oil] with my nose closed with the water in still in my mouth and swallow. Then I take a another drink of water and then I swish my mouth out with water and after all of it is done I have no residue of flax oil taste. It sounds like a lot to do but it really isn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been doing the Shangri-La Diet by eating a daily bowl of yogurt, ground flaxseed (50 g), honey and fruit with my nose clipped shut. It tastes great because it is creamy, sour and sweet and has a variety of textures. It has a fair amount of calories (400?) so it&#8217;s good for weight loss. I have to push myself to drink flaxseed oil but I have no trouble eating this.</p>

He had already lost weight via a low-carb (no potatoes, rice, bread, pasta, fruit juice) diet. That was no longer an option. He came across the Shangri-La Diet.

					<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fhphb">A new BBC series Metalworks!</a> is about the history of British metal working. <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/61801724/How-Economics-Shaped-Human-Nature-by-Seth-Roberts">My theory of human evolution</a> says that decoration &#8212; more precisely, our enjoyment of it &#8212; evolved because it helped the most skilled craftsmen make a living. Long ago, technology evolved via massive amounts of trial and error, which required subsidy since payoff (discovery with practical value) was so infrequent. It was much easier to discover/learn how to make something that looked better than something that worked better, but the two sorts of discoveries were correlated: trial and error produces both.</p>
<p>The episode on ironwork (The Blacksmith&#8217;s Tale) makes explicit how desire for decoration made it easier for the most skilled iron workers to make a living:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Expert, at 16:50:] &#8220;I think decoration entirely depends on the amount of money the patron wanted to spend on that particular object.&#8221; [Narrator:] By the end of the 15th Century, wealthy patrons, such as the Church and monarchy, were hand-picking known craftsmen at the top of their game to match a commission&#8217;s requirements. When King Edward IV commissioned the Cornish smith John Tresillion to make these Gothic gates at Windsor in 1497, he did so with good reason. . . . [Expert:] &#8220;No blacksmith, ordinary blacksmith who was used to making horseshoes, could dream of working to this standard of perfection.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Quality of decoration is easy to see. It doesn&#8217;t matter but it correlates with something that does matter &#8212; amount of trial and error (more trial and error, more innovation). We reward decoration to increase innovation.</p>
<p>The Shangri-La Diet derives from <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">a theory of weight control</a> that emphasizes smell-calorie learning. Smell-calorie learning evolved for the same logical reason. Smells don&#8217;t actually matter for health. But they are easy to notice and they correlate with things that do matter for health, such as calories. Via smell-calorie learning we learn the correlations. After that the foods that smell best are the ones that contain more calories.</p>

The link between the Shangri-La Diet and reduction of non-food addictions (smoking, coffee) fascinates me. People start SLD to lose weight and say they become less addicted to smoking, coffee drinking, and so on. One possibility is that by reducing hunger, SLD reduces discomfort. Addictions gain strength from discomfort, often resemble self-medication.</li>
<li><a href="http://climateaudit.org/2012/05/16/schmidts-conspiracy-theory/">Steve McIntyre replies</a> to Gavin Schmidt&#8217;s claim that McIntyre&#8217;s beliefs resemble &#8220;classic conspiracy theory&#8221;. I used to watch a lot of football &#8212; when the 49ers won most of their games. (I am a classic fairweather fan.) I get a similar pleasure reading Steve McIntyre&#8217;s posts as I did from watching 49er games.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120515150938.htm">Congratulations, UCLA press office!</a> A study that measured the effect of omega-3 by comparing two groups of rats &#8212; one gets omega-3, the other doesn&#8217;t &#8212; is called a study about the evils of fructose (both groups got a high-fructose diet). I am surprised the scientists involved didn&#8217;t object to this misrepresentation. The study supposedly shows &#8212; according to the press office &#8212; that fructose is bad because performance went down when the rats were switched from standard lab chow to a high-fructose diet. Let&#8217;s say you start with a diet (standard lab chow) that has a barely adequate amount of omega-3. You feed both groups lab chow for several months. Then you do an experiment in which both groups get 60% of their calories from the lab chow and 40% of their calories from a diet that contains no omega-3. Performance is likely to decline due to insufficient omega-3 no matter what the new diet contains.</li>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Patrick Tucker, an editor at <em>The Futurist</em>,<a href="http://forum.quantifiedself.com/thread-journalist-seeking-stories"> posted a request on the Quantified Self Forums</a> for &#8220;astounding&#8221; predictions based on self-quantification. He is writing a book about using data to make predictions.</p>
<p>Here are examples from my self-measurement:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Drinking sugar water causes weight loss</strong>. The self-quantification was measuring my weight. It began when I found a new way to lose weight, which pushed me to try to explain why it worked. The explanation I came up with &#8212; a new theory of weight control &#8212; made two predictions that via self-experimentation I found to be true. That gave me faith in the theory. Then the theory suggested a really surprising conclusion, that loss of appetite during a trip to Paris was due to the sugar-sweetened soft drinks I had been drinking. If so, drinking sugar water should cause weight loss. (The nearly-universal belief is that sugar causes weight gain, of course.) <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I tested this prediction and it was true</a>. <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/">More</a>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Seeing faces in the morning improves mood the next day (but not the same day)</strong>. This is so surprising I&#8217;ll spell it out: Seeing faces Monday morning improves my mood on Tuesday but not Monday. For years I measured my sleep trying to reduce early awakening. Finally I figured out that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">not eating breakfast helped</a>. There was no breakfast during the Stone Age; this led me to take seriously the idea that other non-Stone-Age aspects of my life were also hurting my sleep. That was one reason I decided to watch to watch a certain TV show one morning. It had no immediate effect. However, the next morning I woke up feeling great. Via self-measurement of mood, I determined it was the faces on TV that produced the effect, confirmed the effect many times, and learned what details of the situation (e.g., face size) controlled the effect. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/morning-faces-therapy-resources/">More</a>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>One-legged standing improves sleep</strong>. Via self-measurement I determined that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">how much I stood during a day controlled how well I slept</a>. If I stood a long time, I slept better. Ten years later I woke one day after having slept much better than usual. The previous day had been unusual in many ways. One of them was so tiny that at first I overlooked it: I had stood on one leg a few times. Just for a few minutes. Yet <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">it turned out that it was the one-legged standing that had improved my sleep</a>. Without the previous work on ordinary standing I would have ignored the one-legged standing &#8212; it seemed trivial.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Butter is healthy</strong>. I found that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/25/butter-and-arithmetic-how-much-butter/">butter improved how fast I can do arithmetic problems</a>. No doubt it improves brain function measured in other ways. Because the optimum nutrition for the brain will be close to the optimum nutrition for the rest of the body &#8212; at least, this is what I believe &#8212; I predict that butter will turn out to be healthy for my whole body, not just my brain.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Mainstream Vitamin D research is all messed up</strong>. Via self-measurement I confirmed Tara Grant&#8217;s conclusion that taking Vitamin D3 in the morning (rather than later) improved her sleep. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/04/28/effect-of-vitamin-d3-on-my-sleep/">It improved my sleep, too</a>. When I had taken it at other times of day I had noticed nothing. Apparently the timing of Vitamin D &#8212; the time of day that you take it &#8212; matters enormously. Take it at the right time in the morning: obvious good effect. Take it late in the evening: obvious bad effect. Vitamin D researchers haven&#8217;t realized this. They have neither controlled when Vitamin D is taken (in experiments) nor measured when it is taken (in surveys). Because timing matters so much it is as if they have done their research failing to control or measure dose. If you fail to control/measure dose, whatever conclusion you reach (good/no effect/bad) depends entirely on what dose your subjects happened to take. And you have no idea what dose that is.</p>

<p><strong>How did you learn about it?</strong></p>
<p>Freakonomics.  When I read about you in that book, it made sense to me. The whole idea of a setpoint. I used to be an accountant. I weighed 290 pounds. I&#8217;m 6&#8242; 2&#8243;. I lost 25 pounds when I started driving a truck. I&#8217;ve been there for almost 12 years. Around 260. I get a lot of exercise delivering groceries. I can eat anything I want but the idea of going on a diet makes me hungry.  My doctor said lose a bit of weight but I just couldn’t do it. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/04/29/interview-with-a-shangri-la-dieter/#more-6402" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Monday, April 16th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em> I noted that hospital patients given intravenous feeding often lose a lot of weight without hunger. I said this supported my theory that the body fat set point is raised by the smell of food. Without smell, the set point goes down. When your set point goes down you lose weight without becoming hungry.</p>
<p>You should be able achieve the same effect by nose-clipping all your food.<a href="http://gma.yahoo.com/k-e-diet-brides-using-feeding-tubes-rapidly-080053646--abc-news-health.html"> A new diet</a>, however, makes smell avoidance considerably more difficult and expensive.</p>
<blockquote><p>The K-E diet, which boasts promises of shedding 20 pounds in 10 days, is an increasingly popular alternative to ordinary calorie-counting programs. The program has dieters inserting a feeding tube into their nose that runs to the stomach. They&#8217;re fed a constant slow drip of protein and fat, mixed with water, which contains zero carbohydrates and totals 800 calories a day. Body fat is burned off through a process called ketosis, which leaves muscle intact, Dr. Oliver Di Pietro of Bay Harbor Islands, Fla., said.</p>
<p>It is a hunger-free, effective way of dieting,&#8221; Di Pietro said. &#8220;Within a few hours and your hunger and appetite go away completely, so patients are actually not hungry at all for the whole 10 days. That&#8217;s what is so amazing about this diet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Di Pietro says patients are under a doctor&#8217;s supervision, although they&#8217;re not hospitalized during the dieting process. Instead, they carry the food solution with them, in a bag, like a purse, keeping the tube in their nose for 10 days straight. . . .</p>
<p>Schnaider said she was never hungry throughout the 10 days she was on the K-E diet, but admits that it still wasn&#8217;t easy. &#8220;It was emotionally difficult, the 10 days of not eating,&#8221; Schnaider said. . . . Although the K-E diet is new to the United States, it has been around for years in Europe. Dr. Di Pietro charges $1,500 for the 10-day plan, and says the before-and-after pictures sell themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>I sympathize with the &#8220;emotionally difficult.&#8221; When I lost 30 pounds in 3 months drinking sugar water, I ate maybe 50% of my usual calorie intake. I was never hungry and that too was bad. The world seemed drab without hunger.</p>

One way to sum up why this is a mistake: Your health is too important to be left to those who only make money if you are sick.</li>

					<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-27-Alex-Chernavsky-color.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5994" title="2012-02-27 Alex Chernavsky color" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-27-Alex-Chernavsky-color-1024x489.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="350" /></a>Here&#8217;s a new graph I&#8217;ve made of Alex Chernavsky&#8217;s data. In 2001, he started weighing himself and recording his weight with the hope that it would help him lose weight. His data shows several interesting things:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Long walks really helped.</strong> The walks lasted 1.5-2 hours. They weren&#8217;t sustainable but the weight loss they caused lasted a remarkably long time &#8212; years, apparently, in the sense that it took years to regain the lost weight.</p>
<p>2.<strong> A low-carb diet worked well, but only at first</strong>. Alex lost a lot of weight initially but then started to regain it. Just before he became vegetarian, he was regaining weight quickly. I don&#8217;t know if this is typical. The popularity of low-carb diets has not been matched by availability of data about long-term effects, where by &#8220;long-term&#8221; I mean four years. Even though low-carb diets are 150 years old (Banting wrote in 1863).</p>
<p>3. <strong>The Shangri-La Diet is working better than other alternatives</strong>. There&#8217;s a difference between (a) showing that a diet causes weight loss and (b) showing that it works better than other ways of losing weight. In this comparison, it appears more sustainable than long walks and the weight loss it causes appears more sustainable than the weight loss from a low-carb diet.</p>
<p>Alex originally used Shangri-La Diet principles by ingesting 4 tablespoons of flaxseed oil washed down with water. (<a href="http://www.astrocyte-design.com/shangri-la-diet/index.html">Details here</a>.) He lost weight but then started to slowly regain it. I suggested he increase his intake of flavorless calories so he started to eat 1 tablespoon of coconut oil (about 100 calories) each day with his nose clipped. He stopped slowly gaining weight.</p>
<p>I asked Alex why he has persisted weighing himself so long. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had at best a vague idea of what I wanted to do with the data.  When I was in graduate school [in neuroscience], I enjoyed plotting the results of my experiments, so I thought it would be fun to have a dataset that consisted of my own weight measures.  After I started the SLD, I had a more-concrete reason why I needed to collect the data.  I explicitly set out to test the diet.</p></blockquote>

					<p>David Cramer left <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/02/03/vitamin-d3-and-sleep-story-11/#comment-949098">the following comment</a> here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since you started posting these, I’ve been taking D3 in the mornings and notice that I wake up much more easily. I started with just 400 IU, then increased it to 800 IU. One day I took 1200 IU and woke up at 4:00 AM the next day. I’ve gone back to 800 IU since 4:00 AM seems a bit early. For the past week, I’ve also been giving one of my daughters (11 years old) 400 IU each morning, and she seems easier to wake up in the morning (normally it’s quite difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him for details.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m in my 40s and live in Austin, Texas and have two daughters. I first encountered your work when I read about the SLD in Levitt and Dubner&#8217;s blog. I read the pdf of your papers linked from that blog post and tried the SLD with sugar water. At the time, I was at the high end of my ideal weight, but was not motivated by weight as much as curiosity. I found the irony and absurdity of the SLD appealing. I also liked the idea that it could be tested easily and cheaply. I went from ~170 to ~145 lb in couple of months, but really only did SLD for ~3 weeks. I now occasionally have a nose clipped green smoothie in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been taking D3 in the morning? What time do you take it?</strong></p>
<p>I started a couple of weeks ago after you started blogging about it. I take it around 7:00 AM. That would normally be about an hours after I wake up.</p>
<p><strong>The most obvious change since you started taking it is that you wake up more easily? How soon did this start after you started the D3?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the change I notice. It may be improving my sleep quality, but that&#8217;s very subjective and not something I track closely anyway. The effect started almost immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Could you describe (a) how easy it was to wake up in the month before you started the D3 and (b) how easy it was to wake up after you started the D3?</strong></p>
<p>I would often set three alarms on my cell phone and return to bed formore sleep after dismissing the first two. After D3, I usually wake up before my alarm and don&#8217;t feel the need to go back to sleep (e.g. after going to the bathroom). Post-D3, when I wake up, I&#8217;m awake. Previously, I was still very drowsy for some time, even after getting up.</p>
<p><strong>What time do you usually wake up? get out of bed? do you use an alarm clock to wake yourself in the morning?</strong></p>
<p>Usually 6 or 6:30. Occasionally a little earlier if I have an early meeting at work.</p>
<p><strong>Did D3 have any effect on how easily you fall asleep in the evening? On how often you wake up in the middle of the night?</strong></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t noticed any difference in falling asleep. I don&#8217;t typically wake up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>How much sunlight do you get on a typical morning?</strong></p>
<p>Although I live in Texas, I doubt I get much in the morning this time of year. I do bike to work a couple of times a week, but my arms and legs would be covered. I might even wear gloves if it&#8217;s cold. I work inside in an office during the day.</p>
<p><strong>What brand of D3 do you use? what form (e.g., gelcap)?</strong></p>
<p>NOW gelcaps.</p>
<p><strong>How can you tell your daughter &#8220;seems to find it easier to wake up in the morning&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>She&#8217;s a sound sleeper. Normally it requires repeated reminders and threats to get her up. Even after you get her out of bed, she&#8217;ll fall back asleep on the couch. With 400 IU, I&#8217;m noticing less of that. I plan to up to 800 IU this week to see if there&#8217;s a difference.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, January 17th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Years ago I had lunch with a woman whose father ran a chain of weight-loss clinics. They were very successful and he was often invited to give talks. He never accepted these invitations, his daughter said, because he was seriously overweight &#8212; like 300 pounds.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/tara-parker-pope-fat-trap.html?pagewanted=all">Tara Parker-Pope&#8217;s recent <em>New York Times Magazine</em> article</a> &#8220;The Fat Trap&#8221;. Parker-Pope tells us she is &#8220;at least 60 pounds&#8221; overweight, a bit of brave honesty for which I give her credit. I give her less credit for unskeptically quoting expert after expert &#8212; her article is essentially a review of expert opinion. If these experts are as wonderful and accurate as she says (by repeating their ideas), why is she 60 pounds overweight?</p>
<p>She never answers this question. She doesn&#8217;t even seem to ask it. However, someone else asks it. &#8220;The Fat Trap&#8221; includes this:</p>
<blockquote><p>In most modern cultures  . . . to be fat is to be perceived as weak-willed and lazy. It’s also just embarrassing. Once, at a party, I met a well-respected writer who knew my work as a health writer. “You’re not at all what I expected,” she said, eyes widening. The man I was dating, perhaps trying to help, finished the thought. “You thought she’d be thinner, right?” he said. I wanted to disappear, but the woman was gracious. “No,” she said, casting a glare at the man and reaching to warmly shake my hand. “I thought you’d be older.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I already knew it was &#8220;just embarrassing&#8221; to be fat. What&#8217;s interesting is that the story that follows this unremarkable idea doesn&#8217;t support it.  Her date wasn&#8217;t saying she&#8217;s fat. Sixty pounds overweight is not <strong>surprisingly</strong> fat. The &#8220;well-respected writer&#8221; can&#8217;t possibly have been surprised simply by that. Her date knows this. He&#8217;s bringing up something that puzzles him (&#8220;if you know so much about health, why are you fat?&#8221;), a reasonable question. By &#8220;you thought she&#8217;d be thinner, right?&#8221; he means &#8220;you thought, because of her job, she&#8217;d be thinner, right?&#8221; Parker-Pope and her editor don&#8217;t notice this.</p>
<p>Parker-Pope continued to reshape reality in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jean-fain-licsw-msw/fat-trap_b_1184847.html">an interview she gave</a>, which included the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q. What were your hopes in writing &#8220;The Fat Trap&#8221;?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> My hope was that people would leave the article feeling informed and empowered. . . . [I got the story idea talking] with Dr. Michael Rosenbaum at Columbia about the science of weight loss. . . .  [He told me what dieters already know:] that most people who are fat, are going to stay fat. . . . The truth is: Once you&#8217;ve gained weight, it&#8217;s really, really hard for most people to lose weight and keep it off.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is she <strong>sure</strong> this &#8220;truth&#8221; is empowering? To me it sounds discouraging.</p>
<p>The speed of the obesity epidemic &#8212; 30 years ago, Americans were much thinner &#8212; implies that the obesity epidemic has an environmental cause. Genes don&#8217;t change that fast. Something about the environment &#8212; something that controls weight &#8212; has changed. Not exercise. Thirty years ago, Americans probably exercised <strong>less</strong> than now. It is likely that something they ate kept them thin, without trying. Parker-Pope fails to understand this. Or at least failed to ask the experts she spoke to about it. <em>What about the environment has changed?</em> she should have asked. If I were her, I&#8217;d be angry. <em>The obesity epidemic is 30 years old! Thirty f&#8212;ing years! Why is it taking so long to figure out the cause? </em><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>The length of the obesity epidemic reflects research failure. Against her own self-interest, she doesn&#8217;t grasp this. At the end of &#8220;The Fat Trap&#8221;, like a brainwashing victim,  she says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do, ultimately, blame myself for allowing my weight to get out of control.</p></blockquote>
<p><em></em>I disagree. She should not blame herself for not knowing how to stay thin &#8212; hardly anyone knows. No, her failure is journalistic: (a) not grasping that the obesity epidemic must be due to changes in what we eat (lots of people understand this), (b) not grasping this means there must be a way to be almost effortlessly thin (in the 1970s  people were much thinner with little effort), and, above all, (c) not confronting the experts she interviews. Her insensitive date spoke an uncomfortable truth. Now she is failing to ask uncomfortable questions (<em>why is it taking so long?</em>) Much worse.</p>
<p><a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">My theory of weight control</a> says the crucial environmental change that caused the obesity epidemic was increased consumption of foods that produce very strong (= very fattening) smell-calorie associations. To produce a very strong smell-calorie association, a food must (a) have a strong smell (a strong &#8220;flavor&#8221;), (b) have quickly digested calories (e.g., a high glycemic index), and (c) have exactly the same smell each time. All three features, especially the third, are much more true of factory food, fast food, and junk food than of handmade food. Typical food processing almost always increases flavor (e.g., add spices) and speeds digestion (e.g., cooking). Factory and chain restaurant food processing produces much less variable flavor than ordinary human food processing. Exactly when the obesity epidemic started, there was a big shift toward factory and chain restaurant food. One reason was microwave ovens. Microwave entrees taste exactly the same each time. Another reason was an increase in eating at chain restaurants. <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em> goes into more detail.</p>
<p>At the end of &#8220;The Fat Trap&#8221; is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>All the evidence suggests that it’s going to be very, very difficult for me to reduce my weight permanently.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, not all the evidence. <a href="http://www.astrocyte-design.com/shangri-la-diet/index.html">Alex Chernavsky used the Shangri-La Diet</a> to lose 25 pounds and has kept it off easily and apparently permanently.</p>

					<p>Alex Chernavsky, who often comments here, has updated <a href="http://www.astrocyte-design.com/shangri-la-diet/index.html">his Shangri-La Diet (SLD) page</a>. It now shows his weight over four years: two years before he started SLD and two years that he has been doing it.</p>
<p>Before he started SLD he was slowly gaining weight. After he started SLD, he went from 220 pounds (BMI = 32) to 193 pounds. He slowly gained a few pounds. Then (on my advice) he added a tablespoon of nose-clipped coconut butter and the steady climb stopped. Ffor about nine months has been steady at 195  pounds (BMI = 28). In other words, there is no sign that he is regaining the lost weight.</p>
<p>Because Alex has added a lot of omega-3 to his diet (via flaxseed oil), I&#8217;m sure his health has improved in other ways. Because he is a vegan, he had no interest in a conventional (Atkins) low-carb diet.</p>
<p>Alex reminded me that a doctor named Quigley left <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/30/health-care-stagnation/#comment-917709">the following comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve tried to find data that your diet works for SUSTAINED weight reduction in a study that would be applicable to a generalizable population. As you know, temporary weight loss is relatively easy. Sustained weight loss (wt loss &gt; 2 yrs), is hard. If your diet can do it, I’d prescribe it every day.</p>

					<p>Has someone been reading <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em> (2006)? In 2009, the Coca-Cola Company <a href="http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-07/coca-cola-freestyle-most-advanced-soda-fountain-ever">began offering</a> new Coke machines (<a href="http://www.coca-colafreestyle.com/">Coca-Cola Freestyle</a>) that are close to what I proposed in the last chapter. They produce great diversity of flavor because you can mix many different flavors. Your soft drink, with or without sugar, can be different each time.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/del-taco-tests-coca-cola-freestyler-new-touch-screen-fountain-in-12-locations-throughout-southern-california-2011-10-17">this curiously-worded article</a>, they did <strong>not</strong> get the idea from me:</p>
<blockquote><p>The self-serve fountains &#8212; which represent a complete departure from anything The Coca-Cola Company has offered previously &#8212; were in development for more than four years prior to launching in 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>, I proposed adding random flavoring to your food so that it tastes different each time. Someone named this <em>crazy spicing</em>. Nose-clippng is much easier but less socially-acceptable.</p>
