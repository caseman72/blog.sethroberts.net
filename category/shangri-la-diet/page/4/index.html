<p>Alex Chernavsky has kindly given me several years of weight data he collected by weighing himself daily. He read about the Shangri-La Diet in 2005 and several years later decided to try it. The graph above shows what happened: Starting at 222 pounds (BMI = 32), over 11 months he lost 31 pounds, reaching a BMI of 27. Since then &#8212; whileÂ  continuing the diet &#8212; his weight has increased at roughly the same rate it was increasing before he started the diet. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/27/15-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/#more-2234" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>David Mandel, CEO of Alliance United Insurance Company, asks a very reasonable question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite all the success stories [on the Internet] regarding the  Shangri-La Diet, and the mainstream media stories in 2006 after the  book publication, the diet never picked up and seems almost unknown  today.</p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">Whether this is right or wrong depends on expectations. In December, SLD got a great push from being on the website of Tim Ferriss&#8217;s <em>Four Hour Body </em><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Alternative-to-Dieting.pdf">under the attractive title &#8220;Alternative to Dieting&#8221;</a>. Tim&#8217;s book was published in December and registrations to the SLD forums jumped dramatically. Yet even before that, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/02/shangri-la-diet-uptick/">forum traffic was growing</a>. Traffic of course grew when the SLD book came out, later shrank, and now &#8212; surprisingly &#8212; is growing again. My interpretation is that the initial growth was caused by mainstream publicity and blogs. The current growth is caused by word of mouth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If I google &#8220;Shangri-La Diet&#8221; I get about 800,000 hits, a decent amount. &#8220;Sonoma Diet&#8221; &#8212; the book came out the same time as mine &#8212; gets 200,000 hits. &#8220;Eat Right For Your [Blood] Type&#8221; and &#8220;Eat Right 4 Your Type&#8221; get a combined 150,000 hits. That book was a huge hit when it came out in 1997. The usual pattern is Google hits go down, but SLD hits have gone up over the years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, given that my book contained a new theory of weight control that made about 100 times more sense than the usual ideas and led to counter-intuitive new ways to lose weight that actually worked and that obesity is often considered the world&#8217;s #1 health problem &#8212; yeah, it is &#8220;almost unknown&#8221; compared to what one might have expected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was wondering  if you had any insight as to why it did not go viral, if nothing more  from word of mouth from success stories sharing with everyone who will  listen to their excitement. It  seems all but impossible to me that something this simple, and  universally successful which can benefit the masses has managed to not  go mainstream in all these years. I  am utterly baffled, andÂ  assumed there must be a big downside, but all  my searching online has revealed nothing but the success stories and  initial feedback, mostly from 2006 and 2007, and little since. I am just overwhelmed with curiously as to how this did not become the norm for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">When my agent circulated the proposal for the book, one editor regretfully declined to bid on it because she said the book was &#8220;15 years ahead of its time.&#8221; Perhaps she was just being nice, but when people tried the diet, and it worked, they <strong>wouldn&#8217;t tell other people because the diet sounded crazy</strong>. Which means it really was far ahead of its time. <em>Good Morning America</em> filmed me for a short Freakonomics-related segment and they played it for laughs: crazy professor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So that&#8217;s my explanation for why it has spread more slowly than one might have expected: fear of ridicule.</p>

					<p>During the last half of 2010, I noticed today, hits at the <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/">Shangri-La Diet forums</a> steadily increased. The number of hits went from about 300,000 in July to about 500,000 in December.</p>
<p>Before that the number of hits had steadily declined from a high of about 900,000 in August 2009. The number of hits had tended to be higher in the summer so the recent increase is counter-seasonal.</p>

					<p>Unfamiliar foods cause weight loss, says <a href="http://www.sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">the theory behind the Shangri-La Diet</a>. If you add enough spices to a food, it will become unfamiliar.An ice cream store in San Francisco called <a href="http://www.humphryslocombe.com/|_Home_|.html">Humphrey Slocombe</a> has some of the world&#8217;s strangest flavors, likely to be unfamiliar until you eat them many times.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.humphryslocombe.com/|_Flavors_|.html">Their flavors</a> include Eight Ball Stout, Pink Grapefruit Tarragon, Carrot Mango, Russian Imperial Stout, White Chocolate Lavender. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/magazine/04icecream-t.html">what happened when the owners ate a lot of them</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the storeâ€™s first few months, Godby and his business partner, Sean  Vahey, scooped from noon to 9 each night, ate nothing but ice cream,  traded the leftover brownies for cocktails at a dive bar called Dirty  Thieves and still lost weight. Since then theyâ€™ve hired eight employees  and â€” hazard of the job â€” each gained back the 10 pounds theyâ€™d lost.</p>

					<p>Long ago Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford professor, wrote <em>The Population Bomb</em>. Yet you probably know about the demographic transition: A sharp decrease in family size when countries reach a certain level of wealth. Which implies a big problem with Ehrlich&#8217;s forecasts. You probably don&#8217;t know about three related transitions:</p>

					<p>The theory behind the Shangri-La Diet predicts that new food is less fattening than familiar food. At the center of the theory is the idea that smell-calorie associations  raise the set point. New food is less fattening because its smell is less associated with calories. This prediction explained why I often lost weight after visiting foreign countries, but not after visiting other places in America.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I got an email from a 40-year-old man who has taken this a step further:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve developed a variant of your diet which works really well for me,  and which I haven&#8217;t read about so much on your blog, so I thought you  might be interested. Â I live in NYC, and I&#8217;m obsessed about different  foods. Â I&#8217;m constantly on the hunt for new restaurants, novel ethnic  cuisines I&#8217;ve never had, etc, and NYC is a great place to indulge this  hobby. Â A couple of years ago I was about 210 lbs, which on my 6&#8217;0 frame  is at least 30 lbs overweight. Â I read your book, and tried the oil,  etc, and it worked well for me, but it felt like a lot of trouble, and I  was actually dropping weight faster than would normally be considered  healthy. Â  So I changed the strategy, and simply made up a rule, never  to eat the same thing twice.</p>
<p>If I want to lose weight, I follow the rule religiously. Â I go to  different restaurants, order radically different things off the menu,  choose unfamiliar beers, wines, cocktails etc when I&#8217;m out at bars and  clubs. Â If I follow the rule 100% of the time, I drop about 1 lb per week  consistently. Â If I &#8220;cheat&#8221; one or two meals a week, I maintain my  weight. Any more than that and I slowly gain weight. Â  I&#8217;m currently  179 lbs, and have been between 175 and 185 for about two years.  Â Although I&#8217;m active, I&#8217;m no gym rat, and this &#8220;system&#8221; is the only nod  towards a healthy lifestyle I&#8217;ve made during that time. Apart from  never repeating a meal, I eat and drink whatever I feel like.</p></blockquote>
<p>The dose-response relationship (the more he does it, the bigger the effect) makes other explanations less plausible. He later added:</p>
<blockquote><p>One thing I forgot, which is important, is I absolutely don&#8217;t eat when  I&#8217;m not hungry, and I&#8217;ve never had a problem walking away from food if  I&#8217;m full. Â Some people might have problems with that, I guess. Also it  requires more discipline than I made it sound. Especially when you&#8217;re  busy, it&#8217;s very tempting to hit the same lunch spot every day.</p></blockquote>

				<small>Saturday, May 1st, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A woman named Melissa Francis recently thanked me for helping her quit smoking. I was surprised. She said she had applied the ideas behind the Shangri-La Diet to smoking. At the center of SLD is the idea that we learn to associate the flavors (smells) of foods with the calories they contain. If you reduce your exposure to those associations, you lose weight.</p>
<p>Francis took this to suggest that the reason people smoke has a lot to do with the association between the flavors (smells) of smoking and nicotine. If she could reduce her exposure to those associations, it should be much easier to quit. So she did two things: 1. Smoked nicotine-free cigarettes (brand name Quest). 2. Used a nicotine patch. The second thing corresponds to ingestion of smell-free calories, such as sugar water or extra-light olive oil or any food nose-clipped (classic SLD). The first corresponds to exposing yourself to the flavors of foods without swallowing them, an experience whose effects you can read about on the SLD forums <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=5932.0">here</a> and <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=7603.0">here</a>. Learning researchers know that uncorrelating the CS (e.g., smell) and US (e.g., nicotine), as Francis did, is a great way to reduce the association between them.</p>
<p>Francis had previously tried to quit using nicotine-free cigarettes alone. She had failed. She had previously tried to quit using nicotine patches alone. She had failed. With the combination (Quest 3 and 21 mg patch), however, she was successful. <strong>&#8220;I stopped smoking the cigarettes pretty much altogether  within a week or so. From that point, I just stepped down on the patch over the  course of five or six weeks,&#8221;</strong> she wrote. How easy that sounds! My college advisor told me that quitting smoking was the hardest thing she&#8217;d ever done. Francis had been smoking twenty years and smoked about a pack a day. She&#8217;d quite for two years about fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>Francis had the idea herself and hadn&#8217;t heard of anyone else doing this. The closest precedent seems to be the work of a Duke researcher named Jed Rose, for example <a href="http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/7/1139?maxtoshow=&#038;hits=10&#038;RESULTFORMAT=&#038;fulltext=rose%2C+j.e.&#038;searchid=1&#038;FIRSTINDEX=0&#038;resourcetype=HWCIT">this study</a>.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, April 27th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes, the king is naked but only a little girl says so. The king&#8217;s advisers don&#8217;t tell him. I suppose the intended lesson was that powerful people have trouble getting frank answers. That&#8217;s pretty obvious. For a CEO, it&#8217;s said, the scarcest commodity is truth. Bosses learn this all the time. I learned it the first time I asked one of my students what he thought of the class.</p>
<p>Andersen&#8217;s story can be taken differently, partly conveyed by the phrase <em>elephant in the room</em>: Something big and important is overlooked by the supposed experts (in the story, the king&#8217;s advisers). It should be obvious &#8212; but it isn&#8217;t. Or at least no one says anything. This is how Harry Markopolos used the term <em>emperor&#8217;s new clothes</em> in <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/24/harry-markopolos-meet-stephen-mcintyre/"><em>No One Would Listen</em></a>: Madoff was a gigantic fraud, his returns were (to Markopolos) clearly too good to be true, he was enormously visible (in certain circles), but no one said anything. It was as astonishing as a king parading naked. <em>How come no one sees this?</em> Markopolos thought. If you looked at Madoff the right way, he was naked.</p>
<p>That this sort of thing happens isn&#8217;t obvious at all. Yet three books &#8212; which I&#8217;ve just blogged about &#8212; have recently appeared with examples. One is the Markopolos book. Another is <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/22/the-hockey-stick-illusion/"><em>The Hockey Stick Illusion</em></a>. Surely there&#8217;s overwhelming evidence that humans are causing global warming, right? Well, no. The only clear evidence was that hockey stick &#8212; and that&#8217;s a statistical artifact. (It <em>looks</em> like an artifact.) The third is <em><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/26/the-big-short/">The Big Short</a></em>. It wasn&#8217;t easy to find the right sight line from which it was clear that Goldman Sachs et al. were taking on far more risk than they realized but such views existed. I call these books The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes Trilogy. Their broad lesson: <strong>Sometimes the &#8220;best people&#8221; aren&#8217;t right. Sometimes there&#8217;s a point of view from which they&#8217;re glaringly wrong</strong>. <em>The Hockey Stick Illusion</em> is about how Stephen McIntyre found this point of view. In <em>No One Would Listen</em> Markopolos found this point of view. In <em>The Big Short</em> several people found this point of view.</p>
<p>This relates to my self-experimentation in two ways. First, the &#8220;best people&#8221; say self-experimentation is bad. No weight-control researcher does self-experimentation. No sleep researcher does self-experimentation. Surely they know how to do research. It&#8217;s their job. Whereas to me it&#8217;s glaringly obvious that self-experimentation is an excellent research tool, not just because of <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">my results</a> but also because it makes it so much easier to try new things. The best way to learn is to do, IÂ  believe; self-experimentation makes doing much easier. Second, my self-experimentation uncovered all sorts of results that implied that the expert consensus on this or that was glaringly wrong. The Shangri-La Diet is just one example. Breakfast is good, right? Well, no, breakfast may wake you up too early. And so on. At first, I didn&#8217;t grasp the broad lesson I stated earlier (&#8220;Sometimes the &#8220;best people&#8221; aren&#8217;t right. . . &#8220;) and was amazed by what I was finding. To me, The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes Trilogy is support.</p>

					<p>This comment was made recently on <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/04/29/eczema-nighttime-cough-antibiotics-and-fermented-food/">an earlier post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am so glad I found this blog.</p>
<p>My daughter has had coughing fits for 24 months (she&#8217;s 5 1/2 yo).</p>
<p>Inhalers, several doctors, nothing helped. She routinely coughed until vomiting. After one 10 hour coughing fit I reached my limit and scoured the web.</p>
<p>After putting in her whole medical history as search qualifiers I found this [post]. The prior eczema and antibiotics were key indicators.</p>
<p>After 3 days of drinking 1 probiotic shake a day, she showed very marked improvement. After 1 week, no symptoms. This is a girl who&#8217;s been unable to run and play for 2 years. Who woke up coughing and gagging most nights.</p>
<p>After 6 weeks of the same regimen, she still shows no symptoms and is running and playing full blast.</p>
<p>The pulmonary specialist discounts the results we&#8217;ve seen as a fluke . . . we&#8217;ll see. Previously my daughter&#8217;s lung capacity was measured at 47% of expected.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Unable to run and play for 2 years&#8221;! I&#8217;m impressed. Not only (a) the improvement is huge, but also (b) it resembles verification of a prediction, not just something a theory can explain, (c) it wasn&#8217;t obvious to &#8220;several doctors&#8221; or (d) the rest of the Internet, and (e) <strong>after it happened</strong> it was dismissed by an expert, even though the evidence for causality is excellent. The verification aspect reminds me of <a href="http://www.tundrasquid.com/canto3.htm"><em>Pale Fire</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If on some nameless island Captain Schmidt<br />
Sees a new animal and captures it,<br />
And if, a little later, Captain Smith<br />
Brings back a skin, that island is no myth.</p></blockquote>

				<small>Tuesday, December 22nd, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/10/08/modern-biology-cargo-cult-science/">an earlier post</a> I pointed out that modern molecular biology has one big feature in common with cargo-cult science (activities with the trappings but not the substance of science): relentless over-promising. David Horrobin, in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2003/feb/12/genetics.research">a 2003 essay</a>, agreed with me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those familiar with medical research funding know the disgraceful campaigns waged in the 70s and 80s by scientists hunting the genes for such diseases as cystic fibrosis. <em>Give us the money, we&#8217;ll find the gene and then your problems will be solved</em> was the message. The money was found, the genes were found &#8211; and then came nothing but a stunned contemplation of the complexity of the problem, which many clinicians had understood all along.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the question period of a talk by <a href="http://www.lauriegarrett.com/index_withintro.html">Laurie Garrett</a> about science writing at the UC Berkeley School of Journalism, I said there was a kind of conspiracy between scientists and journalists to make research results (in biology/health) appear more important than they really were. <em>Oh, no</em>, said Garrett. If she&#8217;s right, then journalists are completely credulous. They have no idea they&#8217;re being scammed. If I wrote a book called <em>The Real Scientific Method</em>, there would be a whole chapter on better ways (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2006/11/26/brian-wansink-on-research-design/">cool data</a>) and worse ways (over-promising) to promote your work.</p>
<p>The discovery of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin">leptin</a>, the hormone that tells the brain how much fat you have, was front-page news in 1994. Supposedly this discovery would help people lose weight. It is now abundantly clear that it hasn&#8217;t and won&#8217;t. The discoverer of leptin, Jeffrey Friedman, gave a talk at UC Berkeley several years ago and resembled a deer caught in the headlights. All he knew &#8212; following the party line &#8212; was that genetics was important. That genetics was so obviously not the reason for the obesity epidemic . . . he didn&#8217;t mention. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/08/health/08cont.html">This interview</a> gives a sampling of his views. He really does believe in the primacy of genes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the years, Dr. Friedman says, he has watched the scientific data accumulate to show that body weight, in animals and humans, is not under conscious control. Body weight, he says, is genetically determined, as tightly regulated as height.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind animal and human experiments that show adult body weight is controlled by recent diet. Adult height is not controlled by recent diet. What about the obesity epidemic? Well,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Before calling it an epidemic, people really need to understand what the numbers do and don&#8217;t say,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what one molecular biologist &#8212; a professor at Rockefeller University &#8212; is reduced to: telling us what data collected by other people &#8220;do and don&#8217;t say&#8221;. Not to mention qualifying the obvious (Americans are much fatter now than 50 years ago). I&#8217;m sure his lab has all the trappings of modern science. But the planes don&#8217;t land.</p>

					<p><a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=7404.msg94655#msg94655">This comment by goblyn on the Shangri-La Diet forums</a> made me laugh:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you&#8217;re on Atkins it gets harder when you start wanting to sell your first born for a piece of bread.Â  On Weight Watchers you&#8217;d kill for a pizza.Â  On South Beach you&#8217;d sleep with Donald Trump for an order of buffalo wings.Â  On the cabbage soup diet, you&#8217;d willingly chop off your hands if you could eat something&#8230;anything&#8230;other than cabbage soup.Â  On SLD it gets harder when you are suddenly only losing 1 lb a week rather than 4.</p></blockquote>
<p>So well written! The comment continues, in very gratifying way:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s harder when you effortlessly eat 1400 calories a day and don&#8217;t feel deprived.Â  It&#8217;s harder when you have to buy a whole new wardrobe.Â  It&#8217;s harder when you&#8217;re out with friends and they all think you&#8217;re anorexic because you get stuffed from the bread they served before the meal&#8230;Â  But there&#8217;s rarely a moment when it&#8217;s actually HARD.Â  SLD is easy.Â  Yes the weight loss slows down, yes the AS [appetite suppression] gets less noticeable, but at no point does it stop working.Â  You won&#8217;t suddenly find your weight skyrocketing from eating a piece of celery.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It was slightly embarrassing when friends would ask how long I had been on [the Shangri-La Diet]. I lied and said a day &#8211; it had only been eight hours but, hey, without SLD, I normally would have done a great deal of damage in those 8 hours. It&#8217;s now been a week and I&#8217;ve lost three pounds. I love the luxury of choosing finer foods now that I&#8217;m no longer compelled to eat everything in sight when dinnertime comes around. The Monster has been rocked to sleep</p></blockquote>

					<p>From <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/1607887-what-is-the-shangri-la-diet">a review of <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seth Roberts, the diet founder and book author, attempts to explain the science behind how this works, but I won&#8217;t even begin to try to explain it here. I will admit that it is both counterintuitive and at times seems contradictory, but since there was little risk involved I was willing to give it a try.</p>
<p>I was nervous to add the calories into my diet (approximately 120 per tablespoon of olive oil), when all my life experience told me that I should be cutting fat and calories. However, I have only been following the plan for about a week and am amazed at the results. After just one day it was like having instant willpower.</p></blockquote>

					<p>A professor in the Berkeley nutrition department recently told a friend of mine he knew about the Shangri-La Diet. He advised:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t try it. He&#8217;s a psychologist, not a nutritionist.</p></blockquote>
<p>As if weight control didn&#8217;t involve the brain. Perhaps my friend was talking to Marc Hellerstein, who <a href="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/articles.php?issue=11&#038;article=bookreview">told a student reporter </a>that the theory behind the diet makes &#8220;no sense.&#8221;Â  The theory says we stock up on energy when it&#8217;s cheap.</p>

					<p>This is from <a href="http://nicoaddict.wordpress.com/">Confessions of a Nicotine Addict</a>:</p>
<div class="snap_preview">
<blockquote><p>Smoked like a chimney this weekend.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday I started the â€œShangri La Diet,â€ as outlined in the book of the same name by Seth Roberts. Itâ€™s a strangely easy plan and I may be too obtuse to understand how it works, but my appetite was noticeably down all day. (Ok, I had a headache &#038; nasty nausea â€“ but not hungry!)</p>
<p>And I had very few urges to smoke. In fact, I went almost the whole day without nico fit. The thought of smoking was utterly distasteful. Really gross. Now, for the past couple months Iâ€™ve been working on all kinds of visualizations &#038; relaxation techniques, but I really think this weird-ass diet had something to do with it. I ended up giving in at the end of the day, but I only smoked a couple. Yesterday was about the same; today, too.</p>
<p>Maybe the Shangri La Diet curbs <em>all kinds of appetites? </em></p></blockquote>
<p>So well put!</p>
<p>Maybe it does. Here are two possible explanations: 1. The mental effort it took to fight off the urge to eat is no longer necessary, leaving it available to fight off the urge to smoke. This story contradicts this explanation &#8212; the urge to smoke went down.Â  2. Addictions are self-medication. You feel bad, the addicting substance provides relief. If you feel less bad &#8212; less hungry, say &#8212; then you need less relief. This story doesn&#8217;t support this explanation either; nothing is said about relief from overwhelming and unpleasant urges to eat. There is certainly some truth to this basic idea, however &#8212; witness the term <em>addictive personality</em>.</p>
<p>However, in this case I&#8217;d put my money on Explanation #3: Addictions are heavily linked to the environment. The environment triggers a craving. It&#8217;s Pavlovian learning. <a href="http://www.science.mcmaster.ca/psychology/index.php/people/202-dr-shepard-siegel.html">Shepard Siegel</a>, a psychology professor at  McMaster University, originated this explanation and has collected a lot of supporting data. You take Drug A in Environment B. After a while experience B triggers a desire for A. (Obviously it makes sense that we learn to become hungry when food is available.Â  That&#8217;s how appetizers work.) In this case SLD changed her environment. She felt different.</div>
