				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Edward Edmonds is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology" target="_blank">histologist</a> at the Albany Stratton VA Medical Center, Albany, New York. He has been an histologist since 2002. Previously he worked at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, Germany, the Ehrling Bergquist Hospital Offutt AFB, Nebraska, and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (now Joint Pathology Center), Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Recently he left <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/03/25/treat-everyone-as-smart-capable-and-motivated/#comment-1179357" target="_blank">an interesting comment</a> on this blog:<span id="more-13321"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>When I train students I always expect that they will do things a little differently or that they will have new ideas, so . . . my first question is always show me what you have learned or show me how you’d like to do this procedure. In other words they went through the same training I did maybe at a different facility but there are a lot of different ways to approach things we do in the lab, so I let them develop their own “style”. Then after they do it in their own way I show them how I do it my way and I explain step-by-step why I’m doing it this way . . . The entire thing is an enjoyable experience. We are learning, and laughing, and undoing the dogma learned from the academic setting. . . . All of my students end up being excellent troubleshooters and problem solvers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked how he came to this way of teaching. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Through experience. People like to feel good about themselves, no matter their status. If that person feels they have some sort of insight or knowledge that other people don&#8217;t have &#8212; when that person is queried about their knowledge or has an opportunity to discuss it, they light up, becoming a teacher themselves (regardless of the quality of the information). There is a level of confidence there.</p>
<p>What if someone came along and challenged the quality of that information? Let&#8217;s say the person challenging the information was an arrogant prick who did have better information but nonetheless put the ignorant person in their place? The quality of the information might be good, but nothing was actually learned that was relevant to the subject. Instead what was learned was how that prick made the other person feel and the prick feeling unchallenged felt empowered. If there were witnesses to the exchange the information learned was not bidirectional it was <i>omni</i>directional, everybody in the setting learned more about each others&#8217; behavior but nothing relevant was retained because the environment was authoritarian. That is an extreme example but it happens in degrees and often it is subtle.</p>
<p>Now that person who was challenged might go home and for spite try to find things to improve the quality of their information. But the learning is motivated not by genuine interest but by spite which has a tendency to cloud judgment (as we can witness in heated academic debates). Are they learning (understanding) in that state of mind? Probably not.</p>
<p>That is partly where my teaching style comes from. It comes from recognizing the &#8220;state&#8221; in which learning occurs and that someone that learns well who is &#8220;smart, motivated, and capable&#8221; is so, not because they have some inherent grasp on a subject, but because they have confidence in their ability to learn. In other words they are smart because they recognized as being &#8220;smart, motivated, and capable of learning&#8221;. I want to learn from the students just as much as they want to learn. That really is key.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also explained the difference between histologists and pathologists:</p>
<blockquote><p>The histologists/cytologists are the people who develop the microscope slides you often see in studies with different &#8220;stains&#8221; we have a background in chemistry, biology, and anatomy, we do grossing (dissecting specimens), and autopsy, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, etc. A pathologist is some one who makes the diagnosis on the specimens we prepare. We work very closely together and in some facilities our disciplines overlap. However, they are actual doctors. There are also pathology assistants, they typically just gross and do autopsy. So whenever you have surgery or a biopsy it comes to histology to be processed, we do that and then the pathologist makes a diagnosis and puts their signature on it.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a recent dinner, Steve Hansen, a friend of mine, said the difference between his current teaching and earlier teaching is &#8220;night and day,&#8221; partly due to this blog. I asked him to elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> What is your teaching situation?</p>
<p><strong>HANSEN</strong> I&#8217;ve been teaching at Peking University [in Beijing] in the Guanghua MBA program for the last two years. I teach courses in innovation (big company Clayton Christensen sort of stuff), entrepreneurship, and social responsibility/social enterprise. The classes usually consist of 30-50 students from all over the world.<span id="more-12955"></span></p>
<p>My teaching at Peking U. is a part-time job. Full-time I run a social enterprise here in Beijing (<a href="http://phonemica.net/" target="_blank">Phonemica</a>). Before this I was a professional market researcher working at a large company and I worked as a consultant for years. Although I had a little teaching experience early in my career (e.g. taught undergraduates when I was a grad student), I certainly did not have any special teacher training or background. I was hired at Peking U. on the basis of my professional experience. Thus when I started teaching I was to a large extent repeating to my students the experience I had had as an MBA student myself, years ago.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> How did you teach this course at first?</p>
<p><strong>HANSEN</strong> My teaching changed quite a bit in the first year. The first semester I did lecture and discussion. I didn&#8217;t like it. I felt it was a lot of work to prepare, and while it helped me personally a lot, by getting me to summarize my learnings from years of reading and work experience, I didn&#8217;t feel it gave the students a lot. Even though the course got mildly positive reviews, I felt the students weren&#8217;t engaged in a way that made me excited about going to teach.</p>
<p>The second semester I started making changes. First, I took to heart some advice I got to follow more of a case study approach. The experience I gave the students in the beginning of that semester was fairly standard &#8220;case study&#8221; method made famous by Harvard. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wudRjl1TQoI" target="_blank">Here</a>&#8216;s a mini-documentary of how Harvard expects case study method to work. The professor asks pointed questions from the case and expects the students to have answers and defend them.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> What caused you to change how you teach it?</p>
<p><strong>HANSEN</strong> I like the case study method in theory. I like it a lot. I think by mimicking real life situations and summarizing the many facts that synthesize a business manager&#8217;s knowledge and must be put to use in making business decisions, the case study method has the potential to help students learn in a way that is useful: giving them the skills to make real-world decisions, and doing it faster than they could get the same experience by going out and working. As far as activities that can be done in an academic environment go, the case study is pretty darned close to &#8220;learning by doing&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, I found my classroom reality was different from the ideal portrayed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wudRjl1TQoI&amp;noredirect=1#t=6" target="_blank">that Harvard Youtube video</a>, in which a professor says, &#8220;I have been amazed&#8230; at the consistent level of high preparation&#8221;.</p>
<p>In my reality, students often didn&#8217;t come prepared. Sometimes they would say, &#8220;Sorry, I didn&#8217;t have time to read the case&#8221; &#8212; despite significant portions of the grade being dependent on in-class participation. And even if they were prepared, to some extent, often it wouldn&#8217;t be to the extent that I had hoped, where they were able to argue the intricacies of a position and defend it. Instead they might give a cursory answer, with a weak defense, and much of the class would be spent with me pushing them to elaborate their answers through Socratic questioning, lecturing, and so on.</p>
<p>So I was still doing a lot of the talking, and really leading the class. It was better than my first semester, but it wasn&#8217;t meeting my standards of what a real learning environment should be: student-led because they&#8217;re motivated to learn.</p>
<p>It was about at that time that I must have read some of the articles and ideas you published about &#8220;learn by doing&#8221;. Those rang true to me. Learning by doing is something I&#8217;ve always believed in and tried to practice, and I realized that my students still weren&#8217;t doing it.</p>
<p>So later during that semester I started experimenting. My first experiment, I&#8217;m sorry to say, was a complete failure. My approach for a few classes was to have students simply teach the class. I would assign the next class&#8217;s case study to a group. They would read the case and come up with main points. I would meet with them and review what they were going to do. Then they went in and tried to teach their fellow students.</p>
<p>In retrospect it seems obvious that this was wrong. As business school students the &#8220;doing&#8221; that I wanted them to do shouldn&#8217;t have been to &#8220;do teaching&#8221; but to &#8220;do business&#8221; as simulated in the case. When the students were teaching the case they were (again naturally, in retrospect) worse than I was. They would lecture rather than ask. They would miss key issues. And of course they had the same problem I&#8217;d noticed myself: other students weren&#8217;t prepared enough, even though the lecturing group was extremely prepared.</p>
<p>After enough experimentation to realize this wasn&#8217;t working, I cut it off and went back to my semi-successful case study method.</p>
<p>But the failure had given me an idea. I saw that students who were forced to present were MUCH more engaged than those who sat and listened. Why not, I thought, just make everyone present? It would kill several birds with one stone. First, I&#8217;d noticed that students&#8217; presentation skills needed a lot of work. They had trouble being concise and answering the critical questions. Having to present would give them practice on this critical skill. Second, they&#8217;d be engaged and motivated &#8212; at least for the part where they were presenting. Third, by divide-and-conquer of the case itself, we&#8217;d get far deeper into the details and (sometimes) quantitative analysis of the cases.</p>
<p>And so that&#8217;s what I started doing this year. It has worked even better than I imagined. Not only are students engaged for their part of the lecture and discussion; the preparation seems to spill over into the whole case, so most students really know what&#8217;s going on. The presentations get better and better as the semester progresses. In contrast to the past, now I&#8217;m having to shut down vigorous discussions in the interest of time, rather than ask pointed questions to stimulate interest. And best of all, this environment satisfies my own desire of creating a place where students want to learn. I work less, and the students learn more. That&#8217;s the part that seems &#8220;night and day&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>For anyone who&#8217;s curious, there are some details I&#8217;ve worked on to make the approach better, at least for my particular situation. Here&#8217;s the nitty gritty:</p>
<p>I divide the class into random groups of 4-5 students. That group is together for the semester, and for each class they&#8217;re tasked with presenting on one part of the case. I assign that presentation the week before, and it&#8217;s often a question that forces them to take a position. Often, too, I assign the same question to two different groups. This has the effect of creating a sort of debate between the groups, because they almost never come up with the same answer to a question.</p>
<p>I require VERY short presentations. Usually 2 minutes. Sometimes 3 or 4 if the topic is very complex. I allow any member of the group to present. Although I encourage them all to take the opportunity to practice presenting, I don&#8217;t force the issue.</p>
<p>All the students in the group get the same grade, but with the following &#8220;peer evaluation&#8221; element that I adapted from someone else (i read about it online but have now lost track of where). Peer evaluation means that your fellow students give you a grade at the end of the semester. If your fellow students all give you 100%, then you get 100% of the group grade. That&#8217;s the usual case. On the other hand, if all your fellow students give you 50%, that probably means you didn&#8217;t do much and you get only 50% of the group grade &#8212; a guaranteed failure for that portion of the class. In even more detail, what I do is take the average of the peer scores, but not including the lowest score. This virtually eliminates the possibility that one enemy classmate can sabotage a groupmate&#8217;s grade.</p>
<p>Overall I&#8217;ve found that the peer evaluation mostly eliminates the freeloader problem that general plagues groupwork. In cases where someone tries to freeload, they simply get a bad grade, so the other groupmates aren&#8217;t really bothered about it.</p>
<p>At least as importantly, this entire system, once explained, makes my grading job much easier.</p>
<p>I also like the &#8220;group is responsible for the presentation&#8221; approach because it allows some flexibility. There&#8217;s always going to be a week during a semester that a student simply gets swamped with other things and doesn&#8217;t have time to prepare. Under the group presentation regime, the busy students can beg groupmates to cover for them, and then return the favor another week. Would it be better if everyone were always prepared for every class? Well, maybe, but that doesn&#8217;t really seem realistic.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> What did you read that influenced you?</span></p>
<p><strong>HANSEN</strong> I read <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/education/" target="_blank">all your posts about education and teaching</a>. It&#8217;s hard to say any one post made me change the way I teach. It&#8217;s more that your posts about teaching, like your posts about diet etc., often help me consider what my goals are and how I can do low-risk experiments to find better ways to reach those goals.</p>
<p>As for specifics&#8230;</p>
<p>I remember reading <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/12/a-high-school-teacher-learns-something-important-about-teaching/" target="_blank">this</a>, for example, that helped me remember to think about my students&#8217; goals rather than my own for them (not that I think I should have no influence on their goals &#8212; more that I should keep in mind they are autonomous agents about whom I know little and should learn more).</p>
<p>I still grade, but I&#8217;ve experimented with &#8220;grading less&#8221; I guess you could call it, partly inspired by <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/16/teaching-academic-writing-my-plan-part-1-of-2/" target="_blank">discussion like this</a>.</p>
<p>I was probably most influenced/inspired by <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/halmos.pdf" target="_blank">the Halmos paper</a> (also <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2319737?uid=2134&#038;uid=2&#038;uid=70&#038;uid=4&#038;sid=21103450585213" target="_blank">here</a>) you <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">mentioned</a>. I was a math major as an undergraduate, so I liked the subject matter. I was always interested in the kind of simple statement of problems and choices that he describes in that paper, not just in math, but in business and elsewhere. I really enjoy simple problem statements that force one to go through complicated analyses and yet still reduce everything back to a simple statement of resolution. Business at its most interesting can be quite like that. You have to make decisions: fund this project or don&#8217;t. Build this product or build that one. What do you do?</p>
<p>Even more than enjoying the problems, though, I completely agree that the hard part is making students ask questions. It&#8217;s not actually solving the problems that&#8217;s hard; it&#8217;s figuring out what the problems are in the first place. After reading his paper, I started doing some searching and found others who were experimenting with teaching techniques. It would take me a while to re-find those people, but I definitely gleaned ideas from others. These helped shape my own experimentation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hsu mentioned the documentary <em>At Berkeley</em>. In response, someone who had graduated from Berkeley long ago and recently returned <a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2013/11/at-berkeley.html#comment-1126111277" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="display: inline !important;">One thing hasn&#8217;t changed much though, most professors still hate, and with studied contempt, having anything to do with undergraduates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My mom was an undergraduate at Berkeley. I asked her what she thought of this comment. She didn&#8217;t agree, but she didn&#8217;t exactly disagree:<span id="more-12659"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>I got absolutely no sense of &#8220;studied contempt&#8221; or dislike from profs. Some were dull, one went on my forever hate list because he humiliated a student in public, some were difficult, one was very conservative but provoked me into doing good work. More or less enjoyed my economics courses, including one on &#8220;labor&#8221; taught by Clark Kerr. Maybe the sociology professors were like that. I&#8217;d declared it as my major, but didn&#8217;t like a single sociology prof I had, and barely escaped thru to graduation with them.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/26/queen-late/" target="_blank">As I&#8217;ve said</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jowitt">Ken Jowitt</a>, a political science professor at Berkeley, humiliated students who came in late. At one point he was Dean of Undergraduate Studies.</p>
<p>When I got a job at Berkeley, I remembered my mom&#8217;s comment that she&#8217;d had only three good professors (Kerr, Robert Nisbet, and David Mandelbaum, an anthropology professor). I wondered if I would be her idea of a good professor. It turned out that quite a few professors treated undergraduates badly, as Hsu&#8217;s commenter says. One professor told me that when a student came to him with a grading complaint, he made the student put the complaint in writing &#8212; just like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/26/vladimir-putin-masha-gessen-review" target="_blank">in post-Soviet Russia</a>, where paperwork obstacles were placed in front of those who wanted to start a political party. Another professor, I was told, did not look at students who came to see him during office hours. He sat with his back towards them. A third professor, when I asked when the assigned reading would be available (I was auditing his class), wouldn&#8217;t say. &#8220;Sometime,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, the profs I knew avoided students, as Hsu&#8217;s commenter says. One of them, when a student asked to see him, told the student, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be around.&#8221; It was easy to see why they avoided students (students bored them, wanted stuff, were full of complaints, &#8220;wasted&#8221; their time, and had nothing to do with what they really cared about, their research) but it said a lot about the situation, such as how much the professors learned from the students &#8212; not much, apparently.</p>
<p>Yet I learned an enormous amount from my undergraduate students, especially two of them. One student, in response to an open-ended term project assignment, chose to give a talk to a high school class about depression. Yet she had stage fright! It was extremely difficult for her to give that talk. But she did. Based on more conventional assignments, she had seemed a mediocre student. After I read her paper about what she&#8217;d done, I saw how much I had underestimated her. And it wasn&#8217;t just her. I suddenly saw how much the whole system &#8212; which judges undergraduates by how much they resemble professors &#8212; grossly underestimates almost all of them. What a tragedy. This is the fundamental thing to realize about undergraduate education, that students are judged by how closely they resemble professors. Excellence in other ways is ignored. It is an incredibly wasteful system. It is like &#8220;evidence-based medicine&#8221; reviews that ignore 1000 papers on a topic to focus on 4 papers that meet their restrictive criteria. And then claim to have summarized the subject.</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t even the most extreme case. I taught introductory psychology for a few years. One of my lectures was on weight control. I showed a graph of how I had lost weight when I had started eating less processed food &#8212; oranges instead of orange juice, for example. At the same time as the weight loss, I had started to sleep less (40 minutes less per day). One of my students came to my office hour. He said he knew another way to lose weight and need less sleep: eat food high in water content. He showed me a thick book that promoted this. The book looked bad &#8212; no data, just words. But he said it had helped him.</p>
<p>So I tried it. At first I ate four pieces of fruit per day. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>I ran into the student. <em>Hey, I&#8217;m eating four piece of fruit every day, nothing&#8217;s happened,</em> I said. He said, &#8220;I eat <em>six</em> pieces of fruit a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I went from four to six. I was already eating so much fruit that to eat two more pieces meant I had to change my breakfast. I changed it from oatmeal to two pieces of fruit. Exactly then my sleep started getting worse. I had been waking up early about half the time; I started waking up early all the time. Eventually I discovered that any breakfast caused early awakening. Oatmeal was simply better than fruit.</p>
<p>This experience was the turning point in my whole scientific life. It made me begin to realize that personal science &#8212; or self-experimentation, as I called it then &#8212; was a powerful tool.</p>
<p>My views about both teaching and research, in other words, were greatly shaped by contact with undergraduate students. The influence wasn&#8217;t passive &#8212; I did a lot more than simply listen to them &#8212; or simple. I did my part: gave unusual assignments, gave students much more freedom, tried student suggestions. In both cases, I ended up with a point of view very different than my colleagues and very different from the point of view I started with. I think professors can learn a lot from undergraduates because some of them are so different than professors. They are challenging and inspiring in ways graduate students are not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kirsten Marcum told me she had &#8220;put a number of [my] findings to use in [her] own life.&#8221; I asked how. She replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve put a few of your specific recommendations to work (SLD, standing on one leg each day, omega-3s, more animal fat/pork fat, butter tea, fermented foods)&#8230;but in thinking about this, I realized I&#8217;ve gotten even more use out of general principles I&#8217;ve drawn from your blog over the years:<span id="more-12546"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Trust your results</strong>. I&#8217;m thinking of your own (and other people&#8217;s) experiments with what caused acne (dairy, etc.) or migraines (soy) and helped restless leg syndrome (b6) or sleep, etc. You and others tried solutions, and the solutions either worked or they didn&#8217;t, and you/they looked to correct root causes, and those corrections either worked or they didn&#8217;t. If you still have acne, the acne treatment didn&#8217;t work&#8211;even if it should have, and even if an expert recommended it&#8230;and you probably shouldn&#8217;t just keep doing the treatment just because it&#8217;s supposed to work. And if you cleared your acne, then the intervention worked&#8211;regardless of whether it &#8220;should&#8221; have. If your brain performance improves in a measurable way after eating butter, trust that result&#8211;and be skeptical about the people who tell you butter is damaging your health. If treating a leaky gut improves your thyroid labs, trust that&#8211;not the doctor who says your leaky gut diet is too restrictive and is going to damage your health.</p>
<p><strong>2. Many unpleasant circumstances are reversible</strong>. It&#8217;s often possible to find positive interventions that ameliorate, reduce, or remove things that are bothering you&#8211;many of which are cheap or free and not hard to implement. It&#8217;s possible to fix health issues, productivity problems, make learning more fun or effective, etc. It&#8217;s amazing to me how many people don&#8217;t think this is true&#8211;that you&#8217;re stuck with extra weight, or acne, or creaky joints, or back pain, or migraines, or the inability to motivate yourself to work&#8211;and there&#8217;s nothing you can do.</p>
<p><strong>3. Most things that are beneficial are also pleasurable, and vice versa</strong>. When something is good for us, we usually find it pleasurable (animal fat, salt, sugar at night, umami flavors, learning while moving, faces in the morning). Otherwise, how would we have evolved to do it?</p>
<p>I extend this to say: If something&#8217;s not pleasurable but supposed to be beneficial, it&#8217;s either bunk or you&#8217;re doing it wrong (i.e., in a way that removes the pleasure and possibly the benefit.) So look for the pleasure&#8211;because then you&#8217;re more likely to do it and to see a benefit.</p>
<p>And: If something is pleasurable but not beneficial, your body probably wants something very similar and it&#8217;s confused&#8211;junk food umami vs. fermented foods. In which case, find a pleasurable AND beneficial substitute, and it will be easy to stop doing the thing that is not beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be skeptical of experts.</strong> Most experts have incentives that have nothing to do with the reasons you&#8217;re consulting them. Understand this, look for their motivations/weaknesses/blind spots, and always check what they&#8217;re telling you against what your body (or other results) are telling you. Also look for non-experts with interesting ideas.</p>
<p><strong>5. What&#8217;s good for the brain is good for the body</strong>. I would add to this: Many things that we think of as personality or mental/emotional issues actually have a physiological basis&#8211;and optimizing your health will likely have a positive effect.</p>
<p>They sound elementary, but they&#8217;re counter to the way nearly everyone I know thinks.</p>
<p>Over the years, thinking like this has improved my life in multiple ways:</p>
<p>- I 100% cured my back pain (after 3 rough years) with Esther Gokhale&#8217;s 8 Steps to a Pain Free back&#8211;which cost $17 and provided more practical and helpful advice than the two doctors, physical therapist, and personal trainer I consulted.</p>
<p>- After a bunch of looking, I found a doctor who, when presented with new ideas, says: &#8220;That&#8217;s interesting. Where did you find out about it, and what have you tried?&#8221; More than once, she has looked into the subject, found the new recommendation convincing, and has started to share the information with similar patients&#8211;which means I also benefit from what she learns from others.</p>
<p>- I fixed my complexion, have nearly fixed my weight issues, and reversed dozens of nagging health issues (peeling fingernails, bad breath, rosacea flushing, random bad stomachaches, food sensitivities, mood swings, lack of motivation and focus etc.) through a whole-body thyroid/adrenal/gut repair approach that&#8217;s considered bunk by most mainstream endocrinologists. Parts of this approach happen to incorporate things you&#8217;ve found beneficial&#8211;increased amounts of animal fat, fermented foods, focus on optimal sleep, focus on aligning with circadian rhythms. (Interestingly, one of leading proponents of this approach started out focusing on thyroid health and has found even better results by broadening his focus to brain health&#8230;.very much like your &#8220;what&#8217;s good for the brain is good for the body.&#8221;)</p>
<p>FWIW, I tend to use topics you&#8217;ve investigated as a check on other people&#8217;s recommendations&#8211;you&#8217;re not an &#8220;expert&#8221; in the field of thyroid repair, or gut health, etc., so you have no incentives to adhere or not adhere to a particular line of thinking. So if both you and a thyroid doctor find a particular approach beneficial, that seems very convincing to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those are good lessons. Tomorrow I will explain why I think they all come from one somewhat hidden underlying lesson.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Tsinghua this semester I am teaching academic writing. Almost all the students are seniors and almost all of them are applying to graduate school, so I spent several weeks on how to write a personal statement. Each student wrote a draft. I read each draft and made suggestions in one-on-one meetings. The students wrote down my suggestion, and these summaries were compiled into the following guide.<span id="more-12130"></span></p>
<h2>Tips on writing sentences and paragraphs</h2>
<p>Never use many <del>big words</del>! Especially don’t use two big words in a sentence.</p>
<p>Make the sentence <strong>shorter and clearer</strong>. e.g. ”I’ve set my career determination to…” is better replaced by ”My career determination is…”</p>
<p>Use <del>less</del> space (simple and short sentences) on things people know and <strong>more</strong> on things they don’t know. E.g. you might want to list the statistical courses taken to emphasize your data skill. However, it’s better idea that you write more about some experience when statistical method is successfully used.</p>
<p>Make it <strong>clear</strong>. Especially don&#8217;t begin with something complicated and confusing. Stand in the professors’ shoes and figure out a better way to get through.</p>
<p>Put the <strong>main interest in first paragraph</strong>. E.g. I&#8217;m interested in cognitive neuroscience, so I need put it at the first paragraph and make it obviously.</p>
<p>Put the <strong>topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph</strong>. E.g. I should put the main ideas of every paragraph at the first sentence to make it clear. My first research experiment, I should point out I learned cognitive science by practical experiment.</p>
<p>Saying things <strong>more directly</strong> for people to get points. Example: I wanted to tell the readers why I had more interests in one specific field in psychology than others, but I did not mention this intention in the first place and only began with saying that some experience interested or not interested me, which might make the readers confused.</p>
<h2>Things you should write about</h2>
<p>Write things that have <strong>personal flavor</strong>, things that are unique. E.g. quoting from Einstein to illustrate love for cognitive science is not that unique, since everyone heard about them before.</p>
<p>Write about <strong>interesting experiences</strong>, rather than normal and boring things. Or write about experience that make you come up with some interesting thoughts.</p>
<p>Figure out <strong>what experience is important</strong> for your application. E.g. I want to apply to a Ph.D program in educational psychology, then my voluntary teaching experience is equally important as research experience. I should write more about it.</p>
<p>Add a <strong>good story</strong> or something original. Example: I mentioned my little brother in my PS and wanted to point out that it was him who made me get interested in education, yet it lacks some original experience in this part.</p>
<p><strong>What really happened</strong> is more important than what supposed to happen. Better write on past achievement than babble about plans.</p>
<p><strong>Explain the relationship</strong> between two events more clearly. E.g. explain the causal relationship: why something happened make you fall for psychology? Give specific reasons.</p>
<p>Usually use <strong>chronological order</strong>. Example: In the opening paragraph, I firstly said that I had studied psychology for three years blah blah, and then wrote what I once desired to be in high school, which is not in a chronological order.</p>
<p>Show <strong>important time</strong>. E.g. I did my second research in my first year, it was a early time. So, I need make it obvious.</p>
<p>Show the <strong>level of a prize</strong>. E.g. I won the Second Prize of the competition and I should show the difficulties of this prize.</p>
<p><strong>Tell about yourself</strong>, rather than talk about the university.</p>
<p><strong>Introduce yourself</strong> at first. E.g. I start with a sentence by a famous police officer but it has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>Show <strong>your desire for the program</strong>. E.g. UCL&#8217;s program is the one I want to apply for most, so I could say &#8220;UCL program is my first choice because of &#8230; &#8221;</p>
<p>In short, distinguish yourself from other applications by writing <strong>things interesting and convincing</strong> in a coherent way.</p>
<h2>Things that better not appear</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t write <del>something professors are familiar with</del>, write something they don&#8217;t know but in a way they can understand.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t write <del>something sounds unlikely</del>.</p>
<p>Don’t say <del>negative things</del>. E.g. do not say ‘I wasn’t interested in psychology at first’, for it is obviously negative and should be prevented.</p>
<p>Don’t write about <del>anything irrelevant</del>. e.g. Don’t write about your second major in economics if it’s irrelevant to your goal in application. (In this case, writing about economics may convey that you are good at math!)</p>
<p>&#8220;<del>One of my more unusual</del>&#8221; is not interesting. Go for &#8220;one of my best&#8221;</p>
<h2>Tips on writing about researches</h2>
<p>Explain <strong>why you are interested</strong> in your research topic.</p>
<p>If collaborate with someone in a research, <strong>refer to them</strong>.</p>
<p>When talking about a research, the <strong>results and achievements</strong> are important.</p>
<p>No use referring to <del>what you didn&#8217;t do</del> for a research! (E.g. I didn&#8217;t do the literature research in my first psychology experiment. Although I didn&#8217;t do the literature research, and I didn&#8217;t know if others do it, the research is still meaningful and I came up with the idea by myself.)</p>
<p><strong>Tell story</strong> in a powerful and persuasive way. E.g., I wrote about the story of my first voluntary teaching in local elementary school in Beijing. To make the story more convincing, I should write about more details, like how often I went there, how many students there were, what subjects I was teaching, the reactions of the students. Etc.</p>

		<title>A High School Teacher Learns About Teaching</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While reading a <a href="http://educationrealist.wordpress.com/2013/07/21/who-i-am-as-a-teacher/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about teaching high school math, this caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>I tend to stay pretty focused on teaching; rarely do I give A Talk. Today . . . I made an exception.</p>
<p>[teacher] “What is it you think I want?”</p>
<p>[student] “You want me to shut up.” . . .</p>
<p>[teacher] “Why?”</p>
<p>[student] “Because it’s your job!”</p>
<p>[teacher] “Because I want everyone to pass this class.”</p>
<p>The class’s sudden silence [made me realize] that my remark had [had] an impact. . . .</p>
<p><strong>I adopt my students’ values and goals, rather than insist they adopt mine</strong>. [emphasis added. To be sure, this is an overstatement -- the truth is teacher/student compromise -- but you get the point.] The kids were shocked into silence [because] they realized that my most heartfelt goal was to pass everyone in the class. I learned a key lesson I still use every time I meet a new class [--] make it clear I want to help them achieve their goals, which usually involve surviving the class.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was unclear what the &#8220;key lesson&#8221; was so &#8212; I have edited the quote to make it clearer &#8212; so I asked the teacher blogger, who replied</p>
<blockquote><p>The key lesson is <i>explicitly state that I adopt my students’ values and goals, rather than insist they adopt mine</i>. My students&#8217;s awareness that I want to give them value as <strong>they</strong> define it is essential to creating the classroom environment I want.</p>
<p>When I began working full time as a public school teacher [after years doing test prep], I had much tougher kids [than in test prep], and my classes were not as comfortable as I was used to. It was the emptiness or worse, hostility, I got from enough of the students that bothered me. I enjoyed teaching. But I felt something missing around the edges that I&#8217;d always felt&#8211;expected&#8211;from my classrooms, and I couldn&#8217;t even really spell out what was lacking&#8212;not gone, just not universal. I didn&#8217;t know why.</p>
<p>So in that moment [when I told my students that my goal was to help them reach their goals] I realized that one of my greatest teaching strengths was completely under the radar [= not noticed] not only to the toughest of my public school students, but to *me*. Many of my toughest public school students, the ones that had tracking bracelets or a long history of suspensions or just three years of repeated failures&#8212;hell, not only didn&#8217;t they realize that I wanted them to achieve their academic goals, they didn&#8217;t realize they HAD academic goals, since no one had ever told them that just &#8220;passing the class&#8221; was an allowable goal. I&#8217;d never realized how essential that understanding was to the rapport and engagement I had with kids until I experienced teaching without it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only rarely experienced that alienation or hostility since [I learned to be explicit about my priorities]. I still have to be tough and snarl and yell. But now my public school classes give me the same sense of affinity, of understanding, that my test-prep classes did.</p>
<p>All or almost all teachers want their kids to do well. But teachers usually define &#8220;doing well&#8221; by their own ruler, and set their goals higher than is realistic&#8211;and so are often disappointed. I think most people [including high school teachers] don&#8217;t understand the degree to which high school students feel their choices in school are completely out of their control. They can&#8217;t choose most classes, they are &#8220;helped&#8221; by giving them more of the classes they hate (double math periods for strugglers).</p></blockquote>
<p>This supports my view that teaching is much easier when you try to help students reach their goals than when you try to get them to reach your goals. Few teachers I know have figured this out &#8212; at best, they get to <em>different students learn differently </em>and stop. I think it&#8217;s the beginning of wisdom about teaching. I eventually found, after years of experimentation, that (a) my students&#8217;s goals overlapped mine well enough to be acceptable to onlookers and (b) their innate desire to reach those goals was strong enough that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">there was no need to grade them</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This semester at Tsinghua &#8212; which begins this week &#8212; I am going to teach Academic Writing in English. The class is in the Psychology Department. It hasn&#8217;t met yet; I suppose all of my students will be psychology majors. In this post I am describe my plan for teaching it; future posts will describe what actually happened.</p>
<p>Last year I taught a class called Frontiers of Psychology. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">I discovered that I could teach the class without grading</a>. I never gave grades (nor tests), yet the students did lots of work (the assignment completion rate was about 99.9%) and apparently learned a lot. Behind my removal of grading was my belief that long ago people learned everything without grading. Maybe I can use those ancient sources of motivation, rather than fear of a bad grade or desire for a good grade. The details of the course centered on three principles: 1. <strong>Customization</strong>. As much as possible, I tried to allow each student to learn what they wanted to learn. For example, they had a very wide choice of final project. 2. <strong>Doing</strong>. &#8220;The best way to learn is to do&#8221; (Paul Halmos) &#8212; so students did as much as possible. For example, they did experiments. 3. <strong>Telling</strong>. Students told the rest of the class about what they had read or done. I gave plenty of feedback but it was always spoken. For example, after each class presentation I pointed out something I liked and something that could have been better.</p>
<p>It was like the discovery of anesthesia. All of sudden, no pain. No difficult grading decisions. No written comments (explaining the grades), which I wondered if the recipient would understand. The class was a pure pleasure to teach. For the students, no longer did they need to worry about getting a bad (or less than perfect) grade.</p>
<p>Can I repeat this with a much different class? At the same time I taught Frontiers of Psychology, I also taught Academic Writing in English for the first time. It was pass/fail, so I didn&#8217;t grade there, either, but I wasn&#8217;t happy with how it went. (I didn&#8217;t want to teach it again . . . but, a month ago, I learned I am teaching it again.) This time I am going to take what I learned from my Frontiers of Psychology experience and try to create a better class.</p>
<p>In the next post I will describe my overall plan. Throughout the semester I will post about how well my plan is working. Supposedly &#8220;<a href="http://lexician.com/lexblog/2010/11/no-battle-plan-survives-contact-with-the-enemy/" target="_blank">no battle plan survives contact with the enemy</a>&#8221; but my Frontiers of Psychology plan worked fine. I didn&#8217;t change it at all. Maybe my Academic Writing plan will work, maybe it won&#8217;t.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first class of Tsinghua psychology majors in a half-century is graduating in a few days. (The Tsinghua psychology department was closed in the 1950s &#8212; Soviet-style university reorganization &#8212; and reopened in 2008.) The seniors asked their professors for statements to be included in a memento book. My contribution:</p>
<blockquote><p>I remember <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2009/09/22/tsinghua-curiosities-first-day-of-class/" target="_blank">our first day of class</a> (Frontiers of Psychology). It was my first time teaching in China. It was on a Monday, maybe it was your first class at Tsinghua. Some things surprised me. Moving from students in the front row to students in the back, English ability got worse. Each student said their name. When one student said her Chinese name, everyone laughed. I still do not understand this. This had never happened in my American classes. A student had her picture taken with me. This too never happened in America. There were two graduate students in the class. <strong>Both</strong> of them volunteered to be teaching assistants. In America, no graduate students attended my undergraduate classes, and you need to pay them a lot of money to be teaching assistants. (At Tsinghua, that was the only time graduate students came to my class.) The graduate student who became my teaching assistant told you, &#8220;Don&#8217;t say <i>My English is poor</i>. Say <i>My English is on the way.</i>&#8221; I can tell you now I disagree. It is confusing to say <i>My English is on the way</i>. There is nothing wrong with saying <i>My English is poor</i>. I say 我的汉语不很好 all the time. We were all so new that we weren&#8217;t sure when class ended! That was the first thing you made me learn: The length of a class period. I enjoyed having dinner with you. You were less afraid of me than my Berkeley students. I especially remember dinner with 徐胜眉, who told me the Chinese side of the debate about the Chinese takeover of Tibet. Most people in America, including professors like me, had no idea there is another side. I had had a big gap in my knowledge and hadn&#8217;t even realized it. The most important thing I learned from you was how to teach better. The homework you did was very good but I was puzzled how to grade it. From talking with you at dinner and listening to you in class, I could tell that all of you were excellent students. It did not seem like a good idea to make it difficult to get the highest grade, but what was the alternative? This was the puzzle that you pushed me to solve. Eventually I changed how I teach quite a bit, as you may know from talking to students from <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">last year&#8217;s Frontiers of Psychology</a>. Thank you for that, and may you teach your future teachers as well as you taught me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because my students were so good, they made me see the deficiencies in usual teaching methods especially clearly. It really did seem idiotic to take perfectly good work and carefully divide it into piles of best, good, and less good (and give each pile a different grade). Surely there were better uses of my time than making such distinctions and better uses of their time and mental energy than trying to do exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>When I visited Berkeley to be considered for an assistant professor job, one of the interviews was with graduate students. One of them asked, &#8220;Which do you like better, teaching or research?&#8221; &#8220;Research,&#8221; I said. They laughed. All Berkeley professors prefer research, but you&#8217;re supposed to say you like them equally. I was unaware of this. I did like research more, and still do, which is why I am surprised that I talk about teaching so much. I told a friend at lunch recently that it was weird how much I talk about my teaching ideas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last semester I taught Academic Writing to Tsinghua undergraduates (psychology majors). Two earlier posts (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/05/how-to-write-lessons-from-my-writing-class/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/06/how-to-write-what-one-student-learned/" target="_blank">here</a>) summarized what they learned. This post is about what I learned.</p>
<p>When I was an undergraduate, I hated the writing assignments I was given, most of them in English classes. I would have to become nauseous with fear before beginning them. I had nothing to say. When I became a professor and had something to say, everything changed. Writing was easy. This is why &#8212; in spite of believing <em>the best way to learn is to do</em> &#8212; I gave my students only one actual writing assignment: write a personal statement, which they had to do for graduate school applications. On the last day of class, I asked them: If I had assigned you to write something, what would you have written? Answers varied from diary entries to a literature review about nuclear panic. Then I asked them if they would have preferred a class like that. Half said yes, half said no. If I teach the class again, I would make it an option: do the regular homework assignments, or write and revise something you want to write.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe two things about teaching:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. <strong>The best way to learn is to do.</strong> From <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/halmos.pdf" target="_blank">an article by Paul Halmos</a> about teaching math. I began self-experimentation to learn how to do experiments.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Everyone&#8217;s different</strong>. <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">My theory of human evolution</a> says we changed in many ways to facilitate trading. (For example, language began as advertising.)  The more diverse the expertise within a group, the more members of the group can benefit from trade. Following this logic, mechanisms evolved to increase diversity of expertise among people living in the same place with the same genes.  (For example, a mechanism that causes procrastination.) The theory implies that there is something inside every student that pushes them toward expertise &#8212; they <strong>want</strong> to learn &#8212; but they are being pushed in many different directions &#8212; what they want to learn varies greatly.  If you accommodate the latter (diversity in what students want to learn), you can take advantage of the former (an inner drive to learn).</p></blockquote>
<p>The novelty is #2 &#8212; the idea that #2 is relevant to teaching. Human nature: People who are the same want to be different. Formal education: People who are different should be the same.  At Berkeley, most professors appeared to have little idea of the diversity of their students. (At least I didn&#8217;t, until I gave assignments that revealed it.) Almost all classes treated all students in a class the same: same lectures, same assignments, same tests, same grading scheme. I heard dozens of talks about how to teach. Supporting or encouraging individuality never came up. Now and then I told other professors these ideas &#8212; at a party, for example. &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s different, but our classes treat everyone the same,&#8221; I&#8217;d say. No one agreed. It was a new and apparently distasteful idea. <em>Too much work</em> was one response.</p>
<p><span id="more-8902"></span></p>
<p>I believed my theory of human evolution partly because it explained what I saw with my students (Berkeley psychology majors in undergraduate seminars): The more freedom I gave them, the more they learned. I gave them great freedom with their term project (except I forced them to do it off-campus). That worked fine.  One student had an intense fear of public speaking. Her project: give a talk to a high school class. She succeeded. &#8220;What did I learn? I learned that if I have to, I can conquer my fears,&#8221; she wrote. I wrote <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/about/2005_diversityinlearning.pdf" target="_blank">an article</a> about it. I taught a whole class where the students (all 10 of them) were given great freedom to do something off campus. That worked, too. But the class was too niche and the term project too small. It wasn&#8217;t obvious if the ideas would work in an ordinary class.</p>
<p>The more freedom I gave my students, the more difficult it became to grade them. At Tsinghua I teach a required class for freshman psychology majors called Frontiers of Psychology. There are 20-30 students. It covers recent research. For the first few years, I had students write comments on the reading. &#8220;Write something only you could write,&#8221; I said. The students struggled to figure out what that meant. I struggled to grade their answers.</p>
<p>Before last semester began, I had an idea: <em>no grading</em>. Maybe other sources of motivation, would be enough.</p>
<p>Last semester, my Frontiers class had two parts:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Reading</strong>. During this section, they read a variety of things: recent experimental papers (e.g., from <em>Psychological Science</em>), book excerpts (e.g., from <a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/JMichael-Bailey/TMWWBQ.pdf" target="_blank"><em>The Man Who Would Be Queen</em></a>) where I said &#8220;read any 60 pages you want&#8221;, and <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866" target="_blank">my long self-experimentation paper</a> (&#8220;read any third you want&#8221;). This taught them how to do research, not just subject-matter content. A typical assignment included a class presentation. For example, each student read a different experimental paper (they chose) and gave a presentation about it. Another assignment involved an in-class debate. I discussed the readings &#8212; for example, the controversy around <em>The Man Who Would Be Queen</em> &#8212; and gave feedback on presentations but rarely lectured. The main lecture I gave was at the beginning to explain the course. This part of the course resembled a traditional course, except (a) no grades, no tests, (b) many class presentations (public speaking is an important skill),  and (c) lots of choice in what they read.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Doing</strong>. This section had two parts: (a) a short (2 week) experiment where they tested the effect of whatever they wanted (chocolate, piano music, exercise, and naps of different lengths were some choices) on brain function measured by <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/09/brain-tracking-early-experience/" target="_blank">a reaction-time test written in R</a>. They gave presentations about their results (I regret not requiring written reports). (b) a long project (4-5 weeks) where they could study whatever psychological topic they wanted. It might or might not involve data collection. The topics they chose to study included dreams, procrastination, the perception of psychologists, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fujoshi" target="_blank">fujoshi</a>, the relative femininity of different sports, the accuracy of first impressions, different ways of teaching English, comparison of Tsinghua students and Peking University students (the top two universities in China, with stereotypically different students), cognition in native versus non-native language, reading screens versus reading books, and positive psychology. They could work in groups or by themselves. They had to get my approval for what they did so that they wouldn&#8217;t try to do too much or too little. At the end they wrote a report and gave a class presentation. I met with each student or group of students individually to discuss their work, usually for 30-60 minutes. During these discussions they provided evidence (e.g., photographs, recordings) that they had done what they said.</p>
<p>I did give grades (I was required to) but they were minimal. The final grade was entirely based on the final project. I divided each project into parts (e.g., background research, data collection, class presentation) and gave each part a point value such that the points add up to 96 (= A). If you  finish Part X, you get the associated points. (Everyone completed all parts.) If they did really well I gave them slightly more points (e.g., 97). If they failed in some serious way I gave them slightly fewer  (e.g., 94). So grading was close to binary: yes or no. You could get a good grade simply by doing what you said you would do.</p>
<p>It was the most pleasant teaching experience of my life. It was also the easiest by far, in contrast to my Berkeley colleagues&#8217; claim that my ideas led to &#8220;too much work.&#8221;  The hours I had spent every week grading homework in previous versions of the course &#8212; the part of the course I liked  least &#8212; was gone. At the end of the class, I spent many hours discussing the student projects, but I enjoyed these discussions. They didn&#8217;t feel like work. The students had chosen topics they wanted to study and seemed happy to talk about what they had done. Unlike an oral exam, almost nothing was riding on what they told me and they could be proud of what they were talking about, since it was almost entirely their idea.</p>
<p>The students&#8217;s work was the highest quality I have ever seen. Two of their final projects might be publishable. (And these are first-semester freshmen.) It&#8217;s not my field, so I can&#8217;t be sure, but they have great inherent interest and no obvious flaws. The students seemed to like the class, too. On the final day, which happened to be Christmas, they gave me a Christmas card signed by everyone in the class. One student gave me a card separately. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Why did you give me this?&#8221; Among other things, she said I had high standards. Given the absence of grades, that was interesting. Maybe it came from the fact that after every presentation, I would point out something I liked and something I thought could be better. I tried to do that with all of my feedback. Another student told me, after the final class, that what I had said about &#8220;the best way to learn is to do&#8221; was, in her case, very true. She said she had learned more in my class than in all her other classes put together.</p>
<p>There were about 25 students and 12 assignments = 300 (= 25 x 12) assignments total. There were about 4 instances where a student did not do an assignment. In other words, the students did the assignments 99% of the time although there was no obvious penalty for not doing an assignment. Had I given grades, I might have gotten 100% compliance rather than 99%. To use a costly (in terms of time and student anxiety) grading scheme to get a 1% improvement in compliance is absurd. Yet that may be what most professors are doing &#8212; at least, my experience suggests they could get very high compliance without expensive grading.</p>
<p>I think this class worked well for both my students and me because it contained several elements: 1. A &#8220;core curriculum&#8221; (recent psychological research) taught in several different ways. 2. Good-quality materials. For example, <em>The Man Who Would Be Queen</em> is much better than what psychology students typically read. One student told me she read the whole book even though only a third of it was assigned.  3. Plenty of doing. A class presentation counts as doing. 4. Plenty of student choice. 5. Absence of grading, which has bad side effects.</p>
<p>I think several things caused students to learn a lot: 1. The material was interesting. 2. To some extent &#8212; far more than in other classes &#8212; they could choose what they wanted to learn, especially during the second half of the class. 3. Peer pressure. They wanted to look good in front of their peers. It would have been embarrassing to not be able to do a presentation when called upon. 4. The instinct of workmanship. Thorstein Veblen wrote a book called <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/VebIrks.html" target="_blank"><em>The Instinct of Workmanship</em></a>. People inherently want to do a good job, said Veblen. I agree. 5. Doing is fun.</p>
<p>Would this work with other students? My students were/are very smart, yes. Tsinghua is extremely hard to get into and entrance is mostly based on a standardized test. My students, in other words, did very well under the <strong>usual</strong> system of teaching. This can be interpreted two ways: (a) They like the usual way of teaching, it fits them (they succeeded <em>because </em>of the usual methods) or (b) like everyone else, they dislike the usual way of teaching but unlike everyone else figured out how to learn on their own. The first interpretation suggests that my students would benefit <strong>less </strong>than other students from the novelty of my approach. The second interpretation suggests they would benefit <strong>more</strong>. What is clear is that Tsinghua students are known for studying very hard &#8212; yet my class required no studying beyond reading and understanding.</p>
<p>What did I learn? I learned that I can stop grading and things get much better, not worse. I learned that motivations other than grades are plenty powerful.</p>
