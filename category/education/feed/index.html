				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/04/06/what-is-teaching/" target="_blank">I blogged about my belief</a> that a good teacher tries to bring out what is inside their students (not just transfer brain contents), a reader named Terri Fites <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/04/06/what-is-teaching/#comment-1181991" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We homeschool, and I see lots of what you said in my kids.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked her to elaborate. She replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here is where I learned the most starting on day one of kindergarten with my first child five years ago; it is my job to identify strengths, weaknesses, and to help the learner achieve the goal using what they can.  For example, I was embarrassed and appalled that my first child didn&#8217;t read or show any interest in reading to herself until about second grade (7 years old).  However, I continued to provide the necessary environment&#8211;reading wonderful books aloud, having her read a sentence from our selections, occasionally forcing her to read from her own readers.  She had a great verbal understanding and would listen to anything I read aloud to her.  Eventually, slowly, she transitioned and has NO issues with reading now.  Her strength is verbal understanding and listening comprehension.  Her weakness is focus on her own activities and sitting still.</p>
<p>My second child came along and was strong in different ways that I had to discover and appreciate.  Her verbal skills, although perfectly normal, are not her strength, but music rises out of her at every moment.  Clearly we have to do more than music.  Using this strength, I make sure to provide plenty of musical CDs in Spanish for Spanish (which she struggles with&#8211;we have had tutors come for years with the intent the girls become fluent).  We memorize and recite poetry routinely as part of our lessons, and she &#8220;sets&#8221; hers to song/music.  When we do math facts (addition, subtraction, multiplication flash cards), she does best if she hears them in a sing-song voice.  Her strengths are effort, music, rhythm, and art.  Her weaknesses are verbal reasoning and remembering verbal types of things (not so prominent in math and geography skills so her spatial and math skills overcome this problem remembering things).</p>
<p>I would say, particularly in elementary school, that although the reading, writing, and arithmetic skills needed should not be optional&#8211;the timing of learning them and the method of learning them ought to be fluid to a degree.  Everybody should learn to read but we&#8217;re losing kids because they&#8217;re not developmentally ready until second or third grade for some of these verbal/reading things.  By then the bulk of the spelling and phonics rules have been expected to have been learned and the child is probably destined to be a poor speller, decoder, and poor at reading aloud.  (This would be my husband.  Obviously he was able to overcome this, but his spelling and read aloud are not pleasant.  He says he remembers the year when words and reading just started coming together for him.  Unfortunately, that was fifth grade.  Did he need to learn to read and spell then in fifth grade!?  I&#8217;d argue NO!  But, in this case, recognition of a child/type of child is important.  He is very, very logical, and the way that spelling/phonics is taught now/then is NOT so logical.  A rule is given here.  It is broken here.  It is ignored here.  No explanation is given.  A kid learns long A as a_e here or -ay there, but not all the other combinations that make the long A sound&#8211; and certainly not all together in a lesson sequence!!!:  ea, ae, ei, eigh, ai, etc.  The logical child gives up.  There are programs out there like Orton Gillingham, for example, designed to teach the &#8220;rules&#8221; of English in such a logical manner.  Or I design my own curriculum.  But this is not an option for most school teachers.  Autonomy is being denied.)  And now, multiplication is being moved forward in school grades, too.  And analytical, thinking math is being moved forward.  I think we&#8217;ll lose students!  Good students!  &#8220;I&#8217;m no good at math.&#8221;  Geesh.  Because you can&#8217;t do story problems in second grade?  Because you&#8217;re still mastering the facts and you&#8217;re being pushed into application too early?</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent Ph.D. from Berkeley named Dragan <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/04/16/assorted-links-321/#comment-1184012" target="_blank">commented here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Probably the biggest disappointment of my professional life was realizing that Universities are not very much like what I imagined them to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him to elaborate. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>My peers dreamed of being in the sports or movies, of being lawyers, of being rich. Those dreams didn&#8217;t seem so great to me. Instead I fantasized about being a scholar and later in life climbed up the educational ladder towards a PhD at a leading research university. The closer I came to becoming a professor &#8212; my professional goal in life &#8212; the more disappointed I became.</p>
<p>I am somewhat embarrassed to remember this, but I used to say things like: &#8220;Universities are places where people can devote themselves to a life of study, investigation, and imagination. In exchange for a home like this, we provide society with ideas. And, of course, we teach.&#8221; I guess I thought that there should be a home for people who are capable and devoted to intellectual pursuits, a rather naive notion it seems.</p>
<p>I wanted a place where I would be judged primarily by my intellectual and creative ability. Instead I have been made keenly aware of the importance of networking, of doing favors for the right people, of who to cite, whose criticism to acknowledge and whose to ignore. I used to despise such things, now they&#8217;re second nature. The irony, that I now know far more about popularity than I did back in high school. One of the first things I learned is that it is imperative to do research that brings money and/or prestige. In other words: popular research. I didn&#8217;t know such a thing existed.</p>
<p>What if I don&#8217;t want to do popular research? The most common advice I received during my graduate studies: &#8220;Wait till you&#8217;re tenured to do that,&#8221; always said with good intentions.</p>
<p>Only one person told me: &#8220;Do what you believe in. Tenure and accolades will come in time.&#8221; I liked this advice more. But the professor who gave it was fully tenured before I was born. Perhaps things were different in his time? I suspect they were. Last year, two retired professors, each from a major research university, assured me that they would never get tenure in this day and age. They took years with their research and published few yet original papers. &#8220;You have to wait until tenure nowadays,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>This is not what I thought I&#8217;d find. Nor did I expect to find that efficiency and money-making are priorities here. I love what I do, or at least what I want to do. If I could afford to, I&#8217;d do it for free. I mean that as an academic, money seems relatively unimportant. Yet universities seem to be run by people who aren&#8217;t academics and whose primary interest is making money, rather than fostering research. It occurs to me that these two aims may be in conflict.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: I am not saying that academia is altogether bad. I can honestly say it beats unemployment and the handful of low-wage jobs I had as a teenager. And there are days when all the things I just wrote about seem less important and I focus on my research or my teaching. But other times I think, silly me. If only I was smart enough to get rich in the first place, I could have done anything I wanted to &#8212; like pursue research that actually interests me.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a professor (with tenure) at Berkeley, I was fascinated by how mediocre I was. By the usual metrics, I was in the bottom quarter of the distribution. Yet I had made discoveries that I knew were important &#8212; for example, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">a surprising way to lose weight</a>, a <i>really</i> surprising way to improve mood. Although these discoveries impressed me, they <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2012-The-reception-of-my-self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">did not impress my colleagues</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">By the start of my third year of teaching, in 2007, half of my New York City Teaching Fellows cohort had quit teaching. Some for health reasons, some due to differences with their school&#8217;s administration, and some due to the difficulty of teaching during the day and going to graduate school at night. Teaching poor students, writing fifteen-page papers on pedagogy and compiling lesson plans proved to be too much.</span></p>
<p>The day before classes began that year, the principal told me that our students needed to earn an economics credit to fulfill graduation requirements. He asked if I wanted to teach the class. I hadn&#8217;t taken economics since freshman year of college, but I reluctantly agreed. The principal said he had an economics curriculum in his office and he would return shortly with the material. He didn&#8217;t return and never gave me the material. . However, I was able to develop a curriculum on the fly. I had read Gladwell&#8217;s <em>The Tipping Point</em> and watched Gopnik&#8217;s <em>Lighting Up New York</em> documentary. I got the idea to make a curriculum based on Gopnik&#8217;s four theories of New York City crime reduction: Broken Window, Abortion, Child Boom and Korean Immigration. To supplement my curriculum I read <em>Freakonomics</em> and Park&#8217;s <em>The Korean American Dream</em>. I didn&#8217;t have to teach math anymore, because I was teaching economics, but I was still teaching English. My class focused on reading poetry and short stories and writing short essays.</p>
<p>By that time I had earned my Master&#8217;s degree from the City College of New York, and had learned two principles that proved helpful. During an evening class, an African-American female professor, who insisted we call her Doctor, advised us to use the <em>don&#8217;t ask, apologize</em> principle to get around policies with school administrators. For example, instead of asking if I could take my English class to read poetry in Central Park, I should take them knowing that I could simply apologize if I were reprimanded by an administrator. She also told us about a research study done by Lisa Delpit, an education researcher, who advised teachers not use <em>please</em> with inner-city male students. According to her study, when students in that demographic hear the word <em>please</em> they feel they have a choice. For example, a teacher should say, “Go back to your seat,” instead of “Go back to your seat, please.” In my experience, she was right. The command without <em>please</em> worked better.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recall using any other teaching techniques that I was exposed to during graduate school. There should have been more instruction on how to motivate students to study and how to get parents to make their children do their homework. Talking to my students, I learned that, when they get home, most of my female students took naps and most of my male students played video games. Very few of them did any homework, read or studied.</p>
<p>I didn’t give any homework or quizzes in my English class, which had about 20 students, because most of my students didn’t do any schoolwork at home. I had my English students do all of their writing assignments during class time. I didn’t give any homework in the economics classes as well, which had about 30 students, but I had felt compelled to give quizzes to assess how well the students understood my lessons. I knew that the majority of my students weren’t going to study at home, but I hoped that I had explained the material well enough that they would be able to do well on quizzes. I initially did a quiz review the day before the quiz, but that didn’t seem to help the dismal passing rates. I tried doing the quiz review immediately before the quiz, but that didn’t help. I eventually moved to telling my students exactly what was going to be on the quiz, but surprisingly even that didn’t help. When students don’t understand a lesson or do well academically, teachers are supposed to take responsibility, but that’s very difficult to do when most of the students are very apathetic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/04/postmortem_on_c.html#more" target="_blank">Russ Roberts says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Great teaching is more than passing on information. For that you can read a book or watch a video. A great teacher provokes and takes you on a journey of understanding. That requires grappling with the material and making it your own. Usually that means applying your knowledge to a problem you haven&#8217;t see before. At least that&#8217;s often the case in economics. I think Doug Lemov said it in his EconTalk episode &#8212; you haven&#8217;t taught it until they&#8217;ve learned it and learning is more than just hearing the facts or the answer to a problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was the view I heard at UC Berkeley among faculty &#8212; when they weren&#8217;t complaining about teaching.</p>
<p>I disagree with this. The best teachers bring out what is inside their students. They provide the right environment so what is inside each student is expressed. How to do this will be different for each student, so you have to learn about them &#8212; not just generally, you have to learn about each one. (Or at least you have to grasp their diversity and allow for it.)</p>
<p>Learning is natural. Every student, in my experience, wants to learn something. What makes the situation much more difficult, is the false assumption that every student wants to learn the same thing or can be cajoled into learning the same thing. One of my Berkeley students said that in high school he had had a &#8220;great teacher&#8221; of philosophy, much like the teachers that Roberts praises. He had made philosophy so interesting that my student had originally majored in it. That had been a mistake, said my student.</p>
<p>I believe <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">human nature has been shaped in many ways to make our economy work</a>. Human economies center on trading. You make X, I make Y, we trade. If everyone made X, that would be bad economics. So we have been shaped to want to go in different occupational directions &#8212; you want to be an Xer, I want to be a Yer. This is deep inside us and impossible to change. When healthy students have trouble learning, I think the underlying problem is their teacher wants them to be an Xer (like the teacher) &#8212; but they want to be something else. A great teacher finds that something else.</p>
<p>Even the term <i>great teacher</i> is misleading, because it seems to imply that being a great teacher (= every student learns a lot) is difficult. I have found it&#8217;s easy, just as swimming with the current is easy. It requires a certain psychological ingenuity to fit this way of teaching into a system that doesn&#8217;t understand it. But after I figured out how to do it, it was so much easier than teaching the traditional way. I used to try to make all my students learn the same thing. That was really tiring &#8212; like swimming against the current. After class I&#8217;d be exhausted. Now I feel fine after class. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Edward Edmonds is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology" target="_blank">histologist</a> at the Albany Stratton VA Medical Center, Albany, New York. He has been an histologist since 2002. Previously he worked at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, Germany, the Ehrling Bergquist Hospital Offutt AFB, Nebraska, and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (now Joint Pathology Center), Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Recently he left <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/03/25/treat-everyone-as-smart-capable-and-motivated/#comment-1179357" target="_blank">an interesting comment</a> on this blog:<span id="more-13321"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>When I train students I always expect that they will do things a little differently or that they will have new ideas, so . . . my first question is always show me what you have learned or show me how you’d like to do this procedure. In other words they went through the same training I did maybe at a different facility but there are a lot of different ways to approach things we do in the lab, so I let them develop their own “style”. Then after they do it in their own way I show them how I do it my way and I explain step-by-step why I’m doing it this way . . . The entire thing is an enjoyable experience. We are learning, and laughing, and undoing the dogma learned from the academic setting. . . . All of my students end up being excellent troubleshooters and problem solvers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked how he came to this way of teaching. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Through experience. People like to feel good about themselves, no matter their status. If that person feels they have some sort of insight or knowledge that other people don&#8217;t have &#8212; when that person is queried about their knowledge or has an opportunity to discuss it, they light up, becoming a teacher themselves (regardless of the quality of the information). There is a level of confidence there.</p>
<p>What if someone came along and challenged the quality of that information? Let&#8217;s say the person challenging the information was an arrogant prick who did have better information but nonetheless put the ignorant person in their place? The quality of the information might be good, but nothing was actually learned that was relevant to the subject. Instead what was learned was how that prick made the other person feel and the prick feeling unchallenged felt empowered. If there were witnesses to the exchange the information learned was not bidirectional it was <i>omni</i>directional, everybody in the setting learned more about each others&#8217; behavior but nothing relevant was retained because the environment was authoritarian. That is an extreme example but it happens in degrees and often it is subtle.</p>
<p>Now that person who was challenged might go home and for spite try to find things to improve the quality of their information. But the learning is motivated not by genuine interest but by spite which has a tendency to cloud judgment (as we can witness in heated academic debates). Are they learning (understanding) in that state of mind? Probably not.</p>
<p>That is partly where my teaching style comes from. It comes from recognizing the &#8220;state&#8221; in which learning occurs and that someone that learns well who is &#8220;smart, motivated, and capable&#8221; is so, not because they have some inherent grasp on a subject, but because they have confidence in their ability to learn. In other words they are smart because they recognized as being &#8220;smart, motivated, and capable of learning&#8221;. I want to learn from the students just as much as they want to learn. That really is key.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also explained the difference between histologists and pathologists:</p>
<blockquote><p>The histologists/cytologists are the people who develop the microscope slides you often see in studies with different &#8220;stains&#8221; we have a background in chemistry, biology, and anatomy, we do grossing (dissecting specimens), and autopsy, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, etc. A pathologist is some one who makes the diagnosis on the specimens we prepare. We work very closely together and in some facilities our disciplines overlap. However, they are actual doctors. There are also pathology assistants, they typically just gross and do autopsy. So whenever you have surgery or a biopsy it comes to histology to be processed, we do that and then the pathologist makes a diagnosis and puts their signature on it.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Vancouver drug center has started an unusual program: <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/02/19/vancouver-drug-centre-teaching-alcoholics-to-brew-their-own-beer-so-theyll-stop-drinking-mouthwash/" target="_blank">alcoholics bottle homemade beer</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Drug Users Resource Centre, the Downtown Eastside non-profit famous for housing Canada’s first crack pipe vending machine, is also behind what may well be North America’s first program teaching severe alcoholics how to brew their own beer and wine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the alcoholics just do bottling but the people behind the program intend to expand it to include other parts of the beer-making process, such as fermentation.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that they are <strong>not</strong> treating severe alcoholics as passive or disabled &#8212; as recipients of treatment. At least not entirely.</p>
<p>This program reminds me of several things. Geel, a town in Belgium, <a href="http://faculty.samford.edu/~jlgoldst/apa98talk.pdf" target="_blank">treats people with mental illness</a> as valued caregivers. <a href="http://zeynepton.com/" target="_blank">Zeynep Ton</a> says low-level retail employees should be treated as people who can learn many jobs, give good advice to both customers and management, make good use of free time, and so on. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">I treat my students as people who want to learn</a> &#8212; who do not need to be scared into learning by threat of a bad grade &#8212; and are capable of inventing their own assignments.</p>
<p>Is there a general lesson to be drawn from these examples? (All are complicated, in spite of brief descriptions.) Could it be a good idea &#8212; as a default &#8212; to treat those you deal with as smart, capable and motivated? It is no great leap to treat alcoholics as motivated to make beer but it is a slight leap to treat them as capable of making beer. Is the next step is to treat them as smart?</p>
<p>What if doctors, before they saw a patient, told them: <em>Please search the Internet for possible remedies. Bring a list of the ones you want to consider to our meeting. </em>Is that crazy? The slightly subtle point is this may make the doctor happier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting in 2011, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-02-27/in-fake-classes-scandal-unc-fails-its-athletes-whistle-blower#p1" target="_blank">Carolyn Willingham, a tutor at the University of North Carolina, complained to the press about fake classes for athletes</a>. In place of an education, she said, athletes, some of whom could barely read, were encouraged to take fake classes, such as classes that never met.</p>
<p>Jim Dean, executive vice chancellor and provost, responded to her charges like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dean asked Willingham to provide raw test data supporting her analysis. She declined, explaining that she’d obtained the confidential information by promising the university’s Institutional Review Board not to share it with anyone. She told Dean he could obtain the data directly from the athletic department, which gathered it in the first place. He declined to do as she suggested. “If she had the proof,” Dean says, “why wouldn’t she share the proof?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Later Dean handled Willingham&#8217;s charges like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dean said of Willingham: “She’s said our students can’t read, our athletes can’t read, and that’s a lie.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, Willingham had said</p>
<blockquote><p>18 out of the 183 special admit athletes whose records she assessed read at roughly a third-grade level. An additional 110 of the athletes, she said, read at between fourth- and eighth-grade levels. She never said that most, let alone all, of the 800 athletes at UNC are illiterate, and she said nothing at all about the other 18,000 undergraduates.</p>
<p>When challenged, Dean conceded he’d misspoken.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the reporter, apparently, finds Dean&#8217;s defense repugnant. An important detail is that Willingham, who is wealthy, did not need the job. She was free to say whatever she wanted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caltech has a serious problem with undergraduates cheating on academic work, which Caltech administrators appear to be ignoring. A few years ago, one alumnus considered the problem so bad that he urged other alumni to stop donating. I attended Tech (that&#8217;s what we called it) for a year and a half in the 1970s. I didn&#8217;t think cheating was a problem then. Now it is.<span id="more-13014"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/caltech-secrets-of-the-worlds-number-one-university/2011008.fullarticle" target="_blank">A recent article</a> in the <em>Times Higher Education Supplement</em> by Phil Baty praised Caltech&#8217;s &#8220;honor system&#8221;, which includes trusting students not to cheat on exams. A Caltech professor of biology named Markus Meister told Baty that &#8220;cheats simply cannot prosper in an environment that includes such small-group teaching and close collaboration with colleagues because they would rapidly be exposed.&#8221; That strikes me as naive. How convenient for Meister that there is no need to test his theory &#8212; it must be true (&#8220;cheats simply cannot prosper&#8221;).</p>
<p>A few years ago, a Caltech alumnus named Peter Seidel, after receiving a donation request, told his fellow alumni not to donate until the system was cleaned up. Here&#8217;s some of what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I found out today that Dean of Students Jean-Paul Revel said the following to my dad on the phone while I was at Caltech (Not realizing that my dad is a former Caltech student and BOC [Board of Control] rep) &#8220;Peter has a real problem with cheating.  The fact is that people cheat.  Peter needs to get over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the Caltech &#8216;Honor Code&#8217; is obsolete. [= is no longer working -- Seth]</p>
<p>There is a small and growing population of students at Caltech [who] are systematically cheating, and the Caltech administration is aware of it but refuses to do anything about it. I suspect the problem began when Caltech started advertising its &#8216;Honor Code&#8217; to prospective high school students in the 90&#8242;s, which lead to self-selection of students who were willing to bend the rules.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, I caught students cheating red-handed while I was a student, and though I took my findings to the BOC, nothing ever came of it.</p>
<p>I also went to one of my professors (along with several of my classmates) and we explained that we were very concerned that there was a significant amount of cheating going on in his class.  While he was very empathetic and gave us a significant amount of his time, ultimately he essentially said that his hands were tied because the school does not allow him to give proctored exams.</p>
<p>The Caltech exam system is set up in such a way that it is extremely easy to take extra time on an exam, open a book on a closed book exam, or search for the answers on the internet.  Most exams are taken by students alone in their dorm room, with no one watching, at the time of their choosing, with the student timing themself and with both the coursebook and an internet connection in the room, with only the student&#8217;s integrity preventing them from using resources they are not allowed to use.  For that matter, many quizzes and exams are turned in to unlocked boxes in empty hallways where it would be simple to take another students answered exam to copy or check answers against, and then return it when turning in one&#8217;s own exam.  <</p>
<p>In my job in the financial industry I interview a number of Caltech seniors every year for potential jobs.  And unfortunately, I have to try to answer the question 'Is this person a cheater?' as part of my interview process.  I have seen examples of resumes where students flat out lied about their GPA.</p>
<p>But probably the most blatant example . . . is a student [he means graduate -- Seth] that I recently interviewed [who] claimed, as his two 'hobbies', to be a member of the Caltech fencing team his freshman and sophomore years, and a member of the Caltech chess club all four years at Caltech.  As it happened, when I was handed his resume, the coworker sitting to the left of me was a former Caltech grad student that coached the fencing team during those years, and the coworker sitting to the right of me was a former Caltech undergrad who was an avid member of the chess club as both an undergrad and an alum.  Both of them also happened to be part of the group scheduled to interview this student, and received copies of his resume.  I asked them what their opinion was of the candidate.</p>
<p>Neither of them had ever heard of him.</p>
<p>We decided to go ahead and give the candidate an interview, and give him a chance to explain, in case we were somehow misunderstanding the resume.  The first person to interview him was the former fencing coach.  The interview began normally, and then after a while they had the following exchange (I'm paraphrasing somewhat):</p>
<p>Former fencing coach: I see you have two years on the Caltech fencing team.</p>
<p>Candidate: That's right.</p>
<p>Former fencing coach: Well, I was the coach at that time... and I don't remember you.</p>
<p>Candidate: Well, it wasn't actually my freshman and sophomore years; it was just my freshman year.</p>
<p>Former fencing coach: I was the coach both years.</p>
<p>Candidate: Well, I wasn't really on the official team, I just took the PE class that taught fencing.</p>
<p>Former fencing coach: I taught that class.</p>
<p>Candidate: Well, I didn't really take the whole class.  I signed up for it, but I only went to the first week, and then I dropped it.</p>
<p>After the first interview, we decided we wouldn't be making him an offer, but I decided to go in and talk to the candidate anyway. [In] the meantime, the coworker who was a Caltech chess club member asked another chess club friend of his if he knew the guy, and he didn't.  I told the candidate that we wouldn't be offering him a job, but I wanted to talk to him about his resume.  I told him I had heard about the previous interview, and that there were also a couple members of the Caltech chess club who did not know who he was. He responded 'Well, it wasn't a formal team, and not everyone went every time.'  I asked him what night of the week the club met, and he told me (confidently) 'Saturday nights.'  (I knew that it was actually Friday nights.)</p></blockquote>
<p>When people cheat and get away with it, they are more likely to cheat in the future, Seidel believes &#8212; a very plausible idea. Given the disinterest of professors and administrators in the problem, the Caltech mascot should be a monkey with its hands over its eyes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a recent dinner, Steve Hansen, a friend of mine, said the difference between his current teaching and earlier teaching is &#8220;night and day,&#8221; partly due to this blog. I asked him to elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> What is your teaching situation?</p>
<p><strong>HANSEN</strong> I&#8217;ve been teaching at Peking University [in Beijing] in the Guanghua MBA program for the last two years. I teach courses in innovation (big company Clayton Christensen sort of stuff), entrepreneurship, and social responsibility/social enterprise. The classes usually consist of 30-50 students from all over the world.<span id="more-12955"></span></p>
<p>My teaching at Peking U. is a part-time job. Full-time I run a social enterprise here in Beijing (<a href="http://phonemica.net/" target="_blank">Phonemica</a>). Before this I was a professional market researcher working at a large company and I worked as a consultant for years. Although I had a little teaching experience early in my career (e.g. taught undergraduates when I was a grad student), I certainly did not have any special teacher training or background. I was hired at Peking U. on the basis of my professional experience. Thus when I started teaching I was to a large extent repeating to my students the experience I had had as an MBA student myself, years ago.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> How did you teach this course at first?</p>
<p><strong>HANSEN</strong> My teaching changed quite a bit in the first year. The first semester I did lecture and discussion. I didn&#8217;t like it. I felt it was a lot of work to prepare, and while it helped me personally a lot, by getting me to summarize my learnings from years of reading and work experience, I didn&#8217;t feel it gave the students a lot. Even though the course got mildly positive reviews, I felt the students weren&#8217;t engaged in a way that made me excited about going to teach.</p>
<p>The second semester I started making changes. First, I took to heart some advice I got to follow more of a case study approach. The experience I gave the students in the beginning of that semester was fairly standard &#8220;case study&#8221; method made famous by Harvard. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wudRjl1TQoI" target="_blank">Here</a>&#8216;s a mini-documentary of how Harvard expects case study method to work. The professor asks pointed questions from the case and expects the students to have answers and defend them.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> What caused you to change how you teach it?</p>
<p><strong>HANSEN</strong> I like the case study method in theory. I like it a lot. I think by mimicking real life situations and summarizing the many facts that synthesize a business manager&#8217;s knowledge and must be put to use in making business decisions, the case study method has the potential to help students learn in a way that is useful: giving them the skills to make real-world decisions, and doing it faster than they could get the same experience by going out and working. As far as activities that can be done in an academic environment go, the case study is pretty darned close to &#8220;learning by doing&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, I found my classroom reality was different from the ideal portrayed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wudRjl1TQoI&amp;noredirect=1#t=6" target="_blank">that Harvard Youtube video</a>, in which a professor says, &#8220;I have been amazed&#8230; at the consistent level of high preparation&#8221;.</p>
<p>In my reality, students often didn&#8217;t come prepared. Sometimes they would say, &#8220;Sorry, I didn&#8217;t have time to read the case&#8221; &#8212; despite significant portions of the grade being dependent on in-class participation. And even if they were prepared, to some extent, often it wouldn&#8217;t be to the extent that I had hoped, where they were able to argue the intricacies of a position and defend it. Instead they might give a cursory answer, with a weak defense, and much of the class would be spent with me pushing them to elaborate their answers through Socratic questioning, lecturing, and so on.</p>
<p>So I was still doing a lot of the talking, and really leading the class. It was better than my first semester, but it wasn&#8217;t meeting my standards of what a real learning environment should be: student-led because they&#8217;re motivated to learn.</p>
<p>It was about at that time that I must have read some of the articles and ideas you published about &#8220;learn by doing&#8221;. Those rang true to me. Learning by doing is something I&#8217;ve always believed in and tried to practice, and I realized that my students still weren&#8217;t doing it.</p>
<p>So later during that semester I started experimenting. My first experiment, I&#8217;m sorry to say, was a complete failure. My approach for a few classes was to have students simply teach the class. I would assign the next class&#8217;s case study to a group. They would read the case and come up with main points. I would meet with them and review what they were going to do. Then they went in and tried to teach their fellow students.</p>
<p>In retrospect it seems obvious that this was wrong. As business school students the &#8220;doing&#8221; that I wanted them to do shouldn&#8217;t have been to &#8220;do teaching&#8221; but to &#8220;do business&#8221; as simulated in the case. When the students were teaching the case they were (again naturally, in retrospect) worse than I was. They would lecture rather than ask. They would miss key issues. And of course they had the same problem I&#8217;d noticed myself: other students weren&#8217;t prepared enough, even though the lecturing group was extremely prepared.</p>
<p>After enough experimentation to realize this wasn&#8217;t working, I cut it off and went back to my semi-successful case study method.</p>
<p>But the failure had given me an idea. I saw that students who were forced to present were MUCH more engaged than those who sat and listened. Why not, I thought, just make everyone present? It would kill several birds with one stone. First, I&#8217;d noticed that students&#8217; presentation skills needed a lot of work. They had trouble being concise and answering the critical questions. Having to present would give them practice on this critical skill. Second, they&#8217;d be engaged and motivated &#8212; at least for the part where they were presenting. Third, by divide-and-conquer of the case itself, we&#8217;d get far deeper into the details and (sometimes) quantitative analysis of the cases.</p>
<p>And so that&#8217;s what I started doing this year. It has worked even better than I imagined. Not only are students engaged for their part of the lecture and discussion; the preparation seems to spill over into the whole case, so most students really know what&#8217;s going on. The presentations get better and better as the semester progresses. In contrast to the past, now I&#8217;m having to shut down vigorous discussions in the interest of time, rather than ask pointed questions to stimulate interest. And best of all, this environment satisfies my own desire of creating a place where students want to learn. I work less, and the students learn more. That&#8217;s the part that seems &#8220;night and day&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>For anyone who&#8217;s curious, there are some details I&#8217;ve worked on to make the approach better, at least for my particular situation. Here&#8217;s the nitty gritty:</p>
<p>I divide the class into random groups of 4-5 students. That group is together for the semester, and for each class they&#8217;re tasked with presenting on one part of the case. I assign that presentation the week before, and it&#8217;s often a question that forces them to take a position. Often, too, I assign the same question to two different groups. This has the effect of creating a sort of debate between the groups, because they almost never come up with the same answer to a question.</p>
<p>I require VERY short presentations. Usually 2 minutes. Sometimes 3 or 4 if the topic is very complex. I allow any member of the group to present. Although I encourage them all to take the opportunity to practice presenting, I don&#8217;t force the issue.</p>
<p>All the students in the group get the same grade, but with the following &#8220;peer evaluation&#8221; element that I adapted from someone else (i read about it online but have now lost track of where). Peer evaluation means that your fellow students give you a grade at the end of the semester. If your fellow students all give you 100%, then you get 100% of the group grade. That&#8217;s the usual case. On the other hand, if all your fellow students give you 50%, that probably means you didn&#8217;t do much and you get only 50% of the group grade &#8212; a guaranteed failure for that portion of the class. In even more detail, what I do is take the average of the peer scores, but not including the lowest score. This virtually eliminates the possibility that one enemy classmate can sabotage a groupmate&#8217;s grade.</p>
<p>Overall I&#8217;ve found that the peer evaluation mostly eliminates the freeloader problem that general plagues groupwork. In cases where someone tries to freeload, they simply get a bad grade, so the other groupmates aren&#8217;t really bothered about it.</p>
<p>At least as importantly, this entire system, once explained, makes my grading job much easier.</p>
<p>I also like the &#8220;group is responsible for the presentation&#8221; approach because it allows some flexibility. There&#8217;s always going to be a week during a semester that a student simply gets swamped with other things and doesn&#8217;t have time to prepare. Under the group presentation regime, the busy students can beg groupmates to cover for them, and then return the favor another week. Would it be better if everyone were always prepared for every class? Well, maybe, but that doesn&#8217;t really seem realistic.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> What did you read that influenced you?</span></p>
<p><strong>HANSEN</strong> I read <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/education/" target="_blank">all your posts about education and teaching</a>. It&#8217;s hard to say any one post made me change the way I teach. It&#8217;s more that your posts about teaching, like your posts about diet etc., often help me consider what my goals are and how I can do low-risk experiments to find better ways to reach those goals.</p>
<p>As for specifics&#8230;</p>
<p>I remember reading <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/12/a-high-school-teacher-learns-something-important-about-teaching/" target="_blank">this</a>, for example, that helped me remember to think about my students&#8217; goals rather than my own for them (not that I think I should have no influence on their goals &#8212; more that I should keep in mind they are autonomous agents about whom I know little and should learn more).</p>
<p>I still grade, but I&#8217;ve experimented with &#8220;grading less&#8221; I guess you could call it, partly inspired by <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/16/teaching-academic-writing-my-plan-part-1-of-2/" target="_blank">discussion like this</a>.</p>
<p>I was probably most influenced/inspired by <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/halmos.pdf" target="_blank">the Halmos paper</a> (also <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2319737?uid=2134&#038;uid=2&#038;uid=70&#038;uid=4&#038;sid=21103450585213" target="_blank">here</a>) you <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">mentioned</a>. I was a math major as an undergraduate, so I liked the subject matter. I was always interested in the kind of simple statement of problems and choices that he describes in that paper, not just in math, but in business and elsewhere. I really enjoy simple problem statements that force one to go through complicated analyses and yet still reduce everything back to a simple statement of resolution. Business at its most interesting can be quite like that. You have to make decisions: fund this project or don&#8217;t. Build this product or build that one. What do you do?</p>
<p>Even more than enjoying the problems, though, I completely agree that the hard part is making students ask questions. It&#8217;s not actually solving the problems that&#8217;s hard; it&#8217;s figuring out what the problems are in the first place. After reading his paper, I started doing some searching and found others who were experimenting with teaching techniques. It would take me a while to re-find those people, but I definitely gleaned ideas from others. These helped shape my own experimentation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hsu mentioned the documentary <em>At Berkeley</em>. In response, someone who had graduated from Berkeley long ago and recently returned <a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2013/11/at-berkeley.html#comment-1126111277" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="display: inline !important;">One thing hasn&#8217;t changed much though, most professors still hate, and with studied contempt, having anything to do with undergraduates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My mom was an undergraduate at Berkeley. I asked her what she thought of this comment. She didn&#8217;t agree, but she didn&#8217;t exactly disagree:<span id="more-12659"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>I got absolutely no sense of &#8220;studied contempt&#8221; or dislike from profs. Some were dull, one went on my forever hate list because he humiliated a student in public, some were difficult, one was very conservative but provoked me into doing good work. More or less enjoyed my economics courses, including one on &#8220;labor&#8221; taught by Clark Kerr. Maybe the sociology professors were like that. I&#8217;d declared it as my major, but didn&#8217;t like a single sociology prof I had, and barely escaped thru to graduation with them.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/26/queen-late/" target="_blank">As I&#8217;ve said</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jowitt">Ken Jowitt</a>, a political science professor at Berkeley, humiliated students who came in late. At one point he was Dean of Undergraduate Studies.</p>
<p>When I got a job at Berkeley, I remembered my mom&#8217;s comment that she&#8217;d had only three good professors (Kerr, Robert Nisbet, and David Mandelbaum, an anthropology professor). I wondered if I would be her idea of a good professor. It turned out that quite a few professors treated undergraduates badly, as Hsu&#8217;s commenter says. One professor told me that when a student came to him with a grading complaint, he made the student put the complaint in writing &#8212; just like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/26/vladimir-putin-masha-gessen-review" target="_blank">in post-Soviet Russia</a>, where paperwork obstacles were placed in front of those who wanted to start a political party. Another professor, I was told, did not look at students who came to see him during office hours. He sat with his back towards them. A third professor, when I asked when the assigned reading would be available (I was auditing his class), wouldn&#8217;t say. &#8220;Sometime,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, the profs I knew avoided students, as Hsu&#8217;s commenter says. One of them, when a student asked to see him, told the student, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be around.&#8221; It was easy to see why they avoided students (students bored them, wanted stuff, were full of complaints, &#8220;wasted&#8221; their time, and had nothing to do with what they really cared about, their research) but it said a lot about the situation, such as how much the professors learned from the students &#8212; not much, apparently.</p>
<p>Yet I learned an enormous amount from my undergraduate students, especially two of them. One student, in response to an open-ended term project assignment, chose to give a talk to a high school class about depression. Yet she had stage fright! It was extremely difficult for her to give that talk. But she did. Based on more conventional assignments, she had seemed a mediocre student. After I read her paper about what she&#8217;d done, I saw how much I had underestimated her. And it wasn&#8217;t just her. I suddenly saw how much the whole system &#8212; which judges undergraduates by how much they resemble professors &#8212; grossly underestimates almost all of them. What a tragedy. This is the fundamental thing to realize about undergraduate education, that students are judged by how closely they resemble professors. Excellence in other ways is ignored. It is an incredibly wasteful system. It is like &#8220;evidence-based medicine&#8221; reviews that ignore 1000 papers on a topic to focus on 4 papers that meet their restrictive criteria. And then claim to have summarized the subject.</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t even the most extreme case. I taught introductory psychology for a few years. One of my lectures was on weight control. I showed a graph of how I had lost weight when I had started eating less processed food &#8212; oranges instead of orange juice, for example. At the same time as the weight loss, I had started to sleep less (40 minutes less per day). One of my students came to my office hour. He said he knew another way to lose weight and need less sleep: eat food high in water content. He showed me a thick book that promoted this. The book looked bad &#8212; no data, just words. But he said it had helped him.</p>
<p>So I tried it. At first I ate four pieces of fruit per day. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>I ran into the student. <em>Hey, I&#8217;m eating four piece of fruit every day, nothing&#8217;s happened,</em> I said. He said, &#8220;I eat <em>six</em> pieces of fruit a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I went from four to six. I was already eating so much fruit that to eat two more pieces meant I had to change my breakfast. I changed it from oatmeal to two pieces of fruit. Exactly then my sleep started getting worse. I had been waking up early about half the time; I started waking up early all the time. Eventually I discovered that any breakfast caused early awakening. Oatmeal was simply better than fruit.</p>
<p>This experience was the turning point in my whole scientific life. It made me begin to realize that personal science &#8212; or self-experimentation, as I called it then &#8212; was a powerful tool.</p>
<p>My views about both teaching and research, in other words, were greatly shaped by contact with undergraduate students. The influence wasn&#8217;t passive &#8212; I did a lot more than simply listen to them &#8212; or simple. I did my part: gave unusual assignments, gave students much more freedom, tried student suggestions. In both cases, I ended up with a point of view very different than my colleagues and very different from the point of view I started with. I think professors can learn a lot from undergraduates because some of them are so different than professors. They are challenging and inspiring in ways graduate students are not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kirsten Marcum told me she had &#8220;put a number of [my] findings to use in [her] own life.&#8221; I asked how. She replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve put a few of your specific recommendations to work (SLD, standing on one leg each day, omega-3s, more animal fat/pork fat, butter tea, fermented foods)&#8230;but in thinking about this, I realized I&#8217;ve gotten even more use out of general principles I&#8217;ve drawn from your blog over the years:<span id="more-12546"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Trust your results</strong>. I&#8217;m thinking of your own (and other people&#8217;s) experiments with what caused acne (dairy, etc.) or migraines (soy) and helped restless leg syndrome (b6) or sleep, etc. You and others tried solutions, and the solutions either worked or they didn&#8217;t, and you/they looked to correct root causes, and those corrections either worked or they didn&#8217;t. If you still have acne, the acne treatment didn&#8217;t work&#8211;even if it should have, and even if an expert recommended it&#8230;and you probably shouldn&#8217;t just keep doing the treatment just because it&#8217;s supposed to work. And if you cleared your acne, then the intervention worked&#8211;regardless of whether it &#8220;should&#8221; have. If your brain performance improves in a measurable way after eating butter, trust that result&#8211;and be skeptical about the people who tell you butter is damaging your health. If treating a leaky gut improves your thyroid labs, trust that&#8211;not the doctor who says your leaky gut diet is too restrictive and is going to damage your health.</p>
<p><strong>2. Many unpleasant circumstances are reversible</strong>. It&#8217;s often possible to find positive interventions that ameliorate, reduce, or remove things that are bothering you&#8211;many of which are cheap or free and not hard to implement. It&#8217;s possible to fix health issues, productivity problems, make learning more fun or effective, etc. It&#8217;s amazing to me how many people don&#8217;t think this is true&#8211;that you&#8217;re stuck with extra weight, or acne, or creaky joints, or back pain, or migraines, or the inability to motivate yourself to work&#8211;and there&#8217;s nothing you can do.</p>
<p><strong>3. Most things that are beneficial are also pleasurable, and vice versa</strong>. When something is good for us, we usually find it pleasurable (animal fat, salt, sugar at night, umami flavors, learning while moving, faces in the morning). Otherwise, how would we have evolved to do it?</p>
<p>I extend this to say: If something&#8217;s not pleasurable but supposed to be beneficial, it&#8217;s either bunk or you&#8217;re doing it wrong (i.e., in a way that removes the pleasure and possibly the benefit.) So look for the pleasure&#8211;because then you&#8217;re more likely to do it and to see a benefit.</p>
<p>And: If something is pleasurable but not beneficial, your body probably wants something very similar and it&#8217;s confused&#8211;junk food umami vs. fermented foods. In which case, find a pleasurable AND beneficial substitute, and it will be easy to stop doing the thing that is not beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be skeptical of experts.</strong> Most experts have incentives that have nothing to do with the reasons you&#8217;re consulting them. Understand this, look for their motivations/weaknesses/blind spots, and always check what they&#8217;re telling you against what your body (or other results) are telling you. Also look for non-experts with interesting ideas.</p>
<p><strong>5. What&#8217;s good for the brain is good for the body</strong>. I would add to this: Many things that we think of as personality or mental/emotional issues actually have a physiological basis&#8211;and optimizing your health will likely have a positive effect.</p>
<p>They sound elementary, but they&#8217;re counter to the way nearly everyone I know thinks.</p>
<p>Over the years, thinking like this has improved my life in multiple ways:</p>
<p>- I 100% cured my back pain (after 3 rough years) with Esther Gokhale&#8217;s 8 Steps to a Pain Free back&#8211;which cost $17 and provided more practical and helpful advice than the two doctors, physical therapist, and personal trainer I consulted.</p>
<p>- After a bunch of looking, I found a doctor who, when presented with new ideas, says: &#8220;That&#8217;s interesting. Where did you find out about it, and what have you tried?&#8221; More than once, she has looked into the subject, found the new recommendation convincing, and has started to share the information with similar patients&#8211;which means I also benefit from what she learns from others.</p>
<p>- I fixed my complexion, have nearly fixed my weight issues, and reversed dozens of nagging health issues (peeling fingernails, bad breath, rosacea flushing, random bad stomachaches, food sensitivities, mood swings, lack of motivation and focus etc.) through a whole-body thyroid/adrenal/gut repair approach that&#8217;s considered bunk by most mainstream endocrinologists. Parts of this approach happen to incorporate things you&#8217;ve found beneficial&#8211;increased amounts of animal fat, fermented foods, focus on optimal sleep, focus on aligning with circadian rhythms. (Interestingly, one of leading proponents of this approach started out focusing on thyroid health and has found even better results by broadening his focus to brain health&#8230;.very much like your &#8220;what&#8217;s good for the brain is good for the body.&#8221;)</p>
<p>FWIW, I tend to use topics you&#8217;ve investigated as a check on other people&#8217;s recommendations&#8211;you&#8217;re not an &#8220;expert&#8221; in the field of thyroid repair, or gut health, etc., so you have no incentives to adhere or not adhere to a particular line of thinking. So if both you and a thyroid doctor find a particular approach beneficial, that seems very convincing to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those are good lessons. Tomorrow I will explain why I think they all come from one somewhat hidden underlying lesson.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.thewritermoibrahim.com/" target="_blank">Mo Ibrahim</a>, a friend of mine, teaches high school in New York with hard-to-teach students. He and I want to find out if my ideas about teaching can help him. His blog posts here are the story of that.</em></p>
<p>I moved to New York in the summer of 2004 to start the Teaching Fellows summer training program at City College of New York. My wife and kids stayed in Chicago until I could find an apartment.</p>
<p>I found an apartment through a Teaching Fellows message board. It was in a nice section of The Bronx, but I only had three months before I had to find another apartment. I spent the first two months taking Master’s degree classes at City College and studying for two teacher certification exams &#8212; a general exam that all aspiring teachers took and a specialized one for students who majored in special education. There was a lot of pressure to pass the exams, because if you failed you would be expelled from the program.</p>
<p>By the end of the summer, I had passed both exams, gotten a provisional certification to teach, and gotten a job teaching at a high school near Columbus Circle that served underprivileged students. Most of the students were poor and performed far below grade level in reading and math. But I didn’t have a place to live anymore, because my lease was up and the landlord refused to renew it. I applied for a number of apartments all over New York City, but all of my applications were denied. Once I called to make an appointment to visit an apartment and the owner asked me to come over immediately, but when he saw me he said the apartment was no longer available. On another occasion, I was told that the apartment was no longer available after I faxed over a copy of my driver’s license. I assumed all this was because I was black but an elderly Jewish lady said it was due to my Islamic name. So I moved into a hostel in the East Village. By September, I was teaching full time during the day and taking classes at City College at night. Due to the hostel’s two-week limit, I moved to a different hostel in Manhattan every two weeks.</p>
<p>A couple of things struck me when I starting teaching. One was the New York slang. I found myself frequently asking students to translate words and phrases they used. For example, “Yo, it’s mad brick in this class!” meant “It’s very cold in this class!” I was also struck by their apathy. Most of the students appeared to care little about completing class assignments, turning in homework, and studying for quizzes and exams. I would say, “Why didn’t you do your homework?” They would respond, “What’s the big deal? It’s just homework.” Their measure of success was “Did I pass?” Not all of them were like this, but most of them were.</p>
<p>The first subject I was assigned to teach was 11th and 12th grade math &#8212; the two grades were mixed in one class. I had diligently reviewed my high school and college math over the summer, so I was confident I knew the subject. I was assigned to co-teach this class with a veteran teacher. By then he’d been teaching at least fourteen years.</p>
<p>I had gone to a professional development workshop for co-teachers. It had taught seven different co-teaching methods. For example, one was “you teach one day, I teach the next day” or “you teach the first half, I teach the second half”. Different ways of sharing the teaching. In fact, not only did I not teach a single lesson, but I was relegated to the back of the classroom. My co-teacher was really nice otherwise, but he would not let me teach the class. I don’t really know why. When the students were allotted time to work on math problems I would rush to the special education students (students with a learning disability or who were emotionally disturbed, e.g., anger management problems) to give them one-on-one help, but they were usually resistant. They stared at me blankly, or asked off-topic questions like, “Did you see the Yankees game last night?”</p>
<p>Occasionally, students, including non-special education students, would ask me for help. But often in the middle of my explanation the whole-class discussion would resume, and I would have to stop teaching, because my co-teacher asked me not to talk to students while he was teaching. That was my role during my first semester of teaching. I wasn’t despondent, though, because I considered it a blessing in disguise. Since my co-teacher kept me from teaching, I didn’t have to prepare any lessons. He didn’t even allow me to grade any papers, which was a good thing since I was in night school and still living in hostels.</p>
<p>Things changed drastically after the first semester. A veteran English teacher took an emergency leave of absence and I was given her English classes. My math co-teacher asked that all the poor performing special education students be given their own class to be taught by me. A young and friendly English teacher lent me her English curriculum and I developed a modified math curriculum based on the class where I sat in the back. And I was finally able to leave the hostels. I moved into a shared apartment in Brownsville, Brooklyn, the neighborhood where Mike Tyson grew up. It took an hour and twenty minutes on the subway to get to work. During my first commute to work, I overheard someone say: “Did you know Brownsville’s the worst neighborhood in New York?” I hadn&#8217;t known that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Tsinghua this semester I am teaching academic writing. Almost all the students are seniors and almost all of them are applying to graduate school, so I spent several weeks on how to write a personal statement. Each student wrote a draft. I read each draft and made suggestions in one-on-one meetings. The students wrote down my suggestion, and these summaries were compiled into the following guide.<span id="more-12130"></span></p>
<h2>Tips on writing sentences and paragraphs</h2>
<p>Never use many <del>big words</del>! Especially don’t use two big words in a sentence.</p>
<p>Make the sentence <strong>shorter and clearer</strong>. e.g. ”I’ve set my career determination to…” is better replaced by ”My career determination is…”</p>
<p>Use <del>less</del> space (simple and short sentences) on things people know and <strong>more</strong> on things they don’t know. E.g. you might want to list the statistical courses taken to emphasize your data skill. However, it’s better idea that you write more about some experience when statistical method is successfully used.</p>
<p>Make it <strong>clear</strong>. Especially don&#8217;t begin with something complicated and confusing. Stand in the professors’ shoes and figure out a better way to get through.</p>
<p>Put the <strong>main interest in first paragraph</strong>. E.g. I&#8217;m interested in cognitive neuroscience, so I need put it at the first paragraph and make it obviously.</p>
<p>Put the <strong>topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph</strong>. E.g. I should put the main ideas of every paragraph at the first sentence to make it clear. My first research experiment, I should point out I learned cognitive science by practical experiment.</p>
<p>Saying things <strong>more directly</strong> for people to get points. Example: I wanted to tell the readers why I had more interests in one specific field in psychology than others, but I did not mention this intention in the first place and only began with saying that some experience interested or not interested me, which might make the readers confused.</p>
<h2>Things you should write about</h2>
<p>Write things that have <strong>personal flavor</strong>, things that are unique. E.g. quoting from Einstein to illustrate love for cognitive science is not that unique, since everyone heard about them before.</p>
<p>Write about <strong>interesting experiences</strong>, rather than normal and boring things. Or write about experience that make you come up with some interesting thoughts.</p>
<p>Figure out <strong>what experience is important</strong> for your application. E.g. I want to apply to a Ph.D program in educational psychology, then my voluntary teaching experience is equally important as research experience. I should write more about it.</p>
<p>Add a <strong>good story</strong> or something original. Example: I mentioned my little brother in my PS and wanted to point out that it was him who made me get interested in education, yet it lacks some original experience in this part.</p>
<p><strong>What really happened</strong> is more important than what supposed to happen. Better write on past achievement than babble about plans.</p>
<p><strong>Explain the relationship</strong> between two events more clearly. E.g. explain the causal relationship: why something happened make you fall for psychology? Give specific reasons.</p>
<p>Usually use <strong>chronological order</strong>. Example: In the opening paragraph, I firstly said that I had studied psychology for three years blah blah, and then wrote what I once desired to be in high school, which is not in a chronological order.</p>
<p>Show <strong>important time</strong>. E.g. I did my second research in my first year, it was a early time. So, I need make it obvious.</p>
<p>Show the <strong>level of a prize</strong>. E.g. I won the Second Prize of the competition and I should show the difficulties of this prize.</p>
<p><strong>Tell about yourself</strong>, rather than talk about the university.</p>
<p><strong>Introduce yourself</strong> at first. E.g. I start with a sentence by a famous police officer but it has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>Show <strong>your desire for the program</strong>. E.g. UCL&#8217;s program is the one I want to apply for most, so I could say &#8220;UCL program is my first choice because of &#8230; &#8221;</p>
<p>In short, distinguish yourself from other applications by writing <strong>things interesting and convincing</strong> in a coherent way.</p>
<h2>Things that better not appear</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t write <del>something professors are familiar with</del>, write something they don&#8217;t know but in a way they can understand.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t write <del>something sounds unlikely</del>.</p>
<p>Don’t say <del>negative things</del>. E.g. do not say ‘I wasn’t interested in psychology at first’, for it is obviously negative and should be prevented.</p>
<p>Don’t write about <del>anything irrelevant</del>. e.g. Don’t write about your second major in economics if it’s irrelevant to your goal in application. (In this case, writing about economics may convey that you are good at math!)</p>
<p>&#8220;<del>One of my more unusual</del>&#8221; is not interesting. Go for &#8220;one of my best&#8221;</p>
<h2>Tips on writing about researches</h2>
<p>Explain <strong>why you are interested</strong> in your research topic.</p>
<p>If collaborate with someone in a research, <strong>refer to them</strong>.</p>
<p>When talking about a research, the <strong>results and achievements</strong> are important.</p>
<p>No use referring to <del>what you didn&#8217;t do</del> for a research! (E.g. I didn&#8217;t do the literature research in my first psychology experiment. Although I didn&#8217;t do the literature research, and I didn&#8217;t know if others do it, the research is still meaningful and I came up with the idea by myself.)</p>
<p><strong>Tell story</strong> in a powerful and persuasive way. E.g., I wrote about the story of my first voluntary teaching in local elementary school in Beijing. To make the story more convincing, I should write about more details, like how often I went there, how many students there were, what subjects I was teaching, the reactions of the students. Etc.</p>
