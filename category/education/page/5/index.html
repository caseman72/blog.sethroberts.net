				<small>Tuesday, March 6th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>New York</em> magazine has just published <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/law-schools-2012-3">a long article</a> about the lawsuits against law schools for deceptive reporting of job prospects. This is the most radical (in the sense of challenging what &#8220;every reasonable person knows&#8221;) article I&#8217;ve seen in a major magazine in a long time. Gary Taubes&#8217;s article (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/knight-science/fellows/interviews/taubes.html">&#8220;What if It&#8217;s All Been a Big Fat Lie?&#8221;</a>) is a good example of such an article. It was published in 2002. Long long ago <em>The New Yorker</em> published a series of articles by Paul Brodeur (published as a book in 1989) arguing that power lines cause cancer. So long ago that Brodeur <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Brodeur">has retired</a>. Unlike what Taubes and Brodeur wrote, the <em>New York</em> article is not investigative journalism. It was much easier to write. But that does not change the similarity of basic message &#8212; that powerful respected people have been lying to us.</p>
<p>Beyond the sheer existence of this article, it&#8217;s also interesting that nobody interviewed for the article said the allegations were false. For example, here&#8217;s a dean at New York Law School, one of the defendants:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We teach critical thinking, and writing, and so forth,” Buckler said. “And that’s always been the case, and those skills have always been useful. I guess I would say that it’s never been a good reason to go to law school or any grad school, because you think there’s a guarantee at the end. Whether that was twenty years ago or ten years ago or this year.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: It doesn&#8217;t matter if we publish false or misleading data because (a) <strong>we teach useful skills</strong> and (b) <strong>the data don&#8217;t matter</strong> &#8212; right-thinking people ignore such data (&#8220;it&#8217;s never been a good reason to go to law school&#8221; because you think it will provide a job). Recent graduates of New York Law School do an even worse job of defending the school:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mathematically, it’s a ton of graduates, yes, and no, there aren’t enough jobs for them,” Daniel Gershburg, a 2006 graduate of NYLS and an attorney with a successful practice in Manhattan, says. “At the same time, what are schools supposed to say? ‘No, no, don’t come here! Run for your lives! . . . ’” [That is: <strong>Of course they lied</strong>.] Julia Shapiro, who graduated from NYLS in 2007—and who works as a lawyer in Los Angeles—puts it this way: “Suing the school is not going to help them find a job. I would not put my energy into wallowing in my sorrows.” [That is: <strong>Get over it</strong>.]</p></blockquote>
<p>In contrast, it&#8217;s easy to make a case that the schools <strong>intentionally</strong> deceived prospective students. One of the lawyers behind the lawsuits said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“NYLS [New York Law School] has to put students in seats,” Strauss said. “That’s the system they set up for themselves. They’ve got a huge new building, gleaming classrooms, but they’re cutting corners on transparency. They’ve created this reality where the only way they can put [enough] people in seats is by misleading them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A commenter put it like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past 20+ years (since the advent of the U.S. News Rankings, really), the non-elite law schools have perpetrated a pervasive and dynamic fraud aimed at luring unsuspecting college students to throw away their financial futures [due to] reliance upon utterly fraudulent salary-and-employment data. The goal is obvious: to keep the student-loan teat gushing into administrative pockets.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/02/02/law-schools-sued-for-lying/"><br />
As I said earlier</a>, there&#8217;s an old joke: <strong>Why do students go to law school? They&#8217;re bad at math.</strong> Apparently law school administrators are also bad at math. The existence of this story suggests that average reader of <em>New York</em> magazine is not inclined to forgive them.</p>

					<p>If it isn&#8217;t clear <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/05/13/for-whom-do-law-schools-exist/">for whom law schools exist</a>, now <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/02/law-schools-sued-for-lying-about-lawyering.html">it is clearer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The saga began last year, when Strauss and Anziska, both veterans of corporate legal work, filed lawsuits against New York Law School and Thomas M. Cooley Law School, in Michigan. The allegation: That Cooley and NYLS, by allegedly inflating post-graduate employment numbers, had committed fraud and violated local consumer protection acts. . . . The job market for lawyers has been contracting for years; hiring is down across the board. At the same time, law schools have continued to crank out young lawyers at an alarming rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the legal version of <a href="http://insidethelawschoolscam.blogspot.com/2012/01/why-people-dont-get-jobs-as-lawyers.html">the joke</a> that people go to law school because they aren&#8217;t good at math. So far twelve schools have been sued. I look forward to learning how the teachers at those schools react. Which side will they take? .</p>

					<p>An earlier post asked for Tokyo recommendations. A kind reader (Andrew Clarke) provided the following recommendations of off-beat restaurants:</p>
<blockquote><p>One place I always recommend is Andy&#8217;s Shinhinomoto, in Yurakucho: <a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/tokyo/D61101.html" target="_blank">http://www.frommers.com/<wbr>destinations/tokyo/D61101.html</wbr></a>. I have never seen a travel show that has covered the place, but it&#8217;s a best kept secret within the ex-pat community. Its menu is a standard Japanese Izakaya (pub) menu with some of the freshest sashimi (and fish in general) in Tokyo, and the strangest thing &#8211; it&#8217;s ran by a long-term British ex-pat, who is so renowned for his ability to pick good ingredients that he selects and delivers fish for several local sushi shops. Upstairs seating is best for atmosphere, but the food is the same downstairs. They have an English menu, and I&#8217;d also recommend the fish head and tempura. It&#8217;s also not super expensive, somehow I never manage to spend more than 7000Y  with alcohol. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/07/tokyo-restaurant-recommendations-and-why-they-might-be-a-bad-idea/#more-5341" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p></blockquote>

Contrary to what the researcher quoted in this article says, there is already substantial evidence that selenium reduces cancer risk. For example, in a county-by-county map of USA cancer rates, there is a clear rift in the north east. On one side of the rift rates are clearly higher than on the other side of the rift. The rift corresponds to geological fault line. On the low-cancer side of the rift, there is more selenium in the soil. There are also rat experiments.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/the_magic_of_ed.html">this post</a>, Bryan Caplan says (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/03/24/agrees-with-me-about-college/">again</a>) that college is vastly overrated. Like me, he says that the only thing college professors know how to do is be professors and that is all they can actually teach. Graduate school, where professors teach students who want to be professors, makes sense. Undergraduate school, where almost no students will become professors, does not. Like me, he ridicules the idea that professors teach students &#8220;how to think&#8221;. </p>
<p>He omits half of my criticism. It isn&#8217;t just teaching (&#8220;how to think&#8221; &#8212; please!), it&#8217;s also evaluation. Professors are terrible at evaluation. Their method of judging student work is very simple: <em>How close is it to what I would have done?</em> The better you can imitate the professor, no matter what the class, the higher your grade. This is <em>one size fits all</em> with a vengeance because there is no opting out. Sure, you can choose your major. But every class is taught by a professor. What if your strengths lie elsewhere &#8212; in something that your professors aren&#8217;t good at? Tough luck. Your strengths will never be noticed or encouraged or developed. </p>
<p>At Berkeley (where Bryan went and I taught) and universities generally, the highest praise is <em>brilliant</em>. <em>Professor X is brilliant</em>. Or: <em>Brilliant piece of work</em>. People can do great things in dozens of ways, but somehow student work is almost never judged by how beautiful, courageous, practical, good-tasting, astonishing, vivid, funny, moving, comfortable, and so on it is. Because that&#8217;s not what professors are good at. (Except in the less-academic departments, such as art and engineering.) To fail to grasp that students can excel in dozens of ways is to seriously shortchange them. To value them at much less than they are worth &#8212; and, above all, to fail to help them grow and find their place in the world after college.</p>
<p>At Berkeley, I figured this out in a way that a libertarian should appreciate: <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/whatdostudentswant.pdf">I gave my students much more choice</a>. For a term project, I said they could do almost anything so long as it was off-campus and didn&#8217;t involve library work. What they chose to do revealed a lot. I began to see not just how different they were from me but how different they were from each other. One of my students chose to give a talk to a high-school class. This was astonishing because she has severe stage fright. Every step was hard. But she did it. &#8220;I learned that if I really wanted to, I could conquer my fear,&#8221; she wrote. </p>
<p>One of my Tsinghua students recently asked me: &#8220;Are you a brave man?&#8221; (She wanted to give me a gift of stinky tofu.) I said no. She said she thought I was brave for coming to China. Perhaps. I have never done anything as brave as what my student with stage fright did. I have never done something that terrified me &#8212; much less <strong>chosen</strong> to do such a thing. Her homework hadn&#8217;t been very good. When I read about her term project &#8212; conquering stage fright &#8212; I realized how badly I had misjudged her. How badly I had failed to appreciate her strengths. I saw that it wasn&#8217;t just her and it wasn&#8217;t just me. By imposing just one narrow way to excel, the whole system badly undervalued almost everyone. Almost everyone had strengths the system ignored. And it&#8217;s a system almost everyone must go through to reach a position of power!</p>
<p>This is related to what I call <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/29/duct-tape-the-eurozone-and-neglect-of-innovation/">the hemineglect of economists</a> &#8212; they fail to see that innovation should be half of economics. Diversity of talents and interests is central to innovation because new things are so often mixtures of old things. By rewarding only one kind of talent, colleges suppress diversity of talent and thereby reduce innovation. (It&#8217;s no coincidence that Steve Jobs, whom we associate with innovation, didn&#8217;t finish college. He saw his talents wouldn&#8217;t be valued.) Psychologists are also guilty of this. Many psychologists glorify IQ. Somehow having a high IQ is crucial to success . . . somehow a society that doesn&#8217;t encourage people with high IQs will do badly. And so on. In <em>The Bell Curve</em>, Herrnstein and Murray showed that high IQ scores correlated with other measures of desirable social outcomes (e.g., income &#8212; people with higher IQ scores made more money). Like many successful people, they failed to see the possibility that the whole world had been shaped to reward the things that the people in power (i.e., they themselves) are good at. Not because those talents work (= produce a better economy). But because they are easy to measure (by college grades). The glorification of IQ has had a solipsistic aspect and has ignored what should be obvious, that diversity of talents and skills promotes innovation. Without a diverse talent pool, any society will do a poor job of solving the problems that inevitably arise.</p>

					<p>The first paragraph of <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/nov/24/our-universities-why-are-they-failing/">an article by Anthony Grafton</a> called &#8220;Our Universities: Why Are They Failing?&#8221; contains this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At every level of the system, dedicated professors are setting students on fire with enthusiasm for everything from the structure of crystals to the structure of poems.</p>
<p>Grafton means this as praise, of course: <strong>Wow, these professors are doing a great job!</strong> I disagree. I think there are a million things in the world to be enthusiastic about &#8212; the structure of crystals and the structure of poems are two examples, no better or worse than the rest. I also think it is fundamentally foolish for a professor to try to make every student in his or her class as enthusiastic about X as the professor happens to be. It is foolish because it ignores human variability, which is great along these lines. (I think diversity of interest and enthusiasm is large because <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf">such diversity helps produce diverse economies</a>.) It would be much better for the students if the professor were to help them develop their own unique enthusiasms.</p>
<p>I suspect Grafton has never considered this possibility. In discussions at Berkeley that I attended about how to be a good teacher, including special seminars, it <strong>never</strong> came up. Yet I taught a class at Berkeley (Psychology and the Real World) where I did just that: I allowed students to do volunteer work off-campus about almost anything they wanted. They chose the work, not me.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, October 26th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>At Tsinghua University, which is like a Chinese MIT, I am teaching a small class (25 students) called Frontiers of Psychology. It is required of freshmen psychology majors. There are a few students from other majors. So many of my students do brilliant work that it is hard to keep track. For example, two classes ago I started having presentations (short talks related to the reading). In the very first one, a student talked about her dysmenorrhea and self-experimentation to stop it. Later, during a discussion of how to give a talk, another (female) student said, &#8220;I could not have given such a talk.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s a compliment, right?&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said. Which is only to say what a radical and stunning talk it was.</p>
<p>For this week&#8217;s class I assigned several readings, from which students chose one. <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jk762/Side-Effect.pdf">The shortest and most popular paper</a>, by Joshua Knobe, a Yale professor of philosophy, was about judgments of intentionality. Knobe showed subjects various scenarios and asked them whether the side effects of a action described in the scenario should be considered intentional or not. Changing one word had a big effect. Knobe concluded that we tend to see bad side effects as intentional, good side effects as unintentional. I assigned it because the effect of changing one word was large and I liked the source of data (&#8220;Subjects were 78 people spending time in a Manhattan public park&#8221;).</p>
<p>Here is one student&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was in primary school, we had a very kind English teacher who was quite close to me. After she left school, she sent some photos to me and I found it a great honor to deliver them to my classmates. Later on, a math teacher got married and she gave another pupil some sweets to deliver the class. I felt unpleasant since not every student could get a sweet. I thought it unjust.</p>
<p>However, in both cases, photos and sweets, there weren&#8217;t enough for the whole class. The only difference was who passed them out. When I did, the main issue I cared about was “I’m the one to deliver them”; in the other case, “Why can’t everyone get one?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She titled her comment &#8220;We are the Heroes, They are the Villains&#8221;. Her point was that Knobe&#8217;s results could be explained by the idea that we slant our judgments of others and ourselves to make them look worse and us look better &#8212; an explanation that Knobe didn&#8217;t consider.</p>
<p>Knobe isn&#8217;t the only one who didn&#8217;t think of it. Other students proposed other plausible explanations. But I think the &#8220;we are heroes&#8221; explanation is quite plausible because three other students made the same point in other ways. One of them repeated a story from a test preparation book:</p>
<blockquote><p>A teacher had a student do ten math problems on the board. Then she asked another student to describe what he saw. &#8220;Two of the answers are wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What about the eight correct answers?&#8221; said the teacher.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not a true story but surely based on actual events. Another student told of the time her teacher had made her push her fellow students to exercise for an half-hour per day. The students complained to her about their loss of time. Later, however, her class had finished first in a physical competition &#8212; much better than usual. Her classmates did not give her any credit for this.</p>
<p>To emphasize how unobvious this idea is, here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Knobe#The_Knobe_Effect">what two professors make of Knobe&#8217;s results</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This asymmetry in responses between the ‘harm’ and ‘help’ scenarios, now known as the Knobe effect, provides a direct challenge to the idea of a one-way flow of judgments from the factual or non-moral domain to the moral sphere. ‘These data show that the process is actually much more complex,’ argues Knobe.</p></blockquote>
<p>My students disagree. Their proposed explanations, such as the &#8220;we are heroes&#8221; idea, were not &#8220;much more complex&#8221;. </p>
<p>I believe they have noticed a broad truth about human nature that has escaped many psychologists, not just Knobe. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/magazine/dont-blink-the-hazards-of-confidence.html?ref=magazine">this excerpt</a> from his new book, my former colleague Danny Kahneman describes what he calls &#8220;the illusion of validity&#8221;: personality judgments were considered more predictive than they actually were by the people who made them. Could this be another example of &#8220;we are heroes&#8221;? The &#8220;we are heroes&#8221; idea also explains the Lake Wobegone Effect: Most people consider themselves above average. The technical name for this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority">illusory superiority</a>. The Wikipedia article about illusory superiority does not mention the Knobe Effect and vice-versa. In this important aspect of human nature, professors (including me) have had trouble seeing that the trees make a forest.</p>

					<p>China has hundreds of colleges. Tsinghua and Beijing University are at the top (top tier), followed by perhaps 20 colleges considered second-tier. A friend of mine attends a third-tier school. In all of her classes, <strong>class consists of the professor reading the textbook. Word for word.</strong> (Which, by the way, doesn&#8217;t happen at Tsinghua, I checked.)</p>
<p>Perhaps you grimace. I think <strong>this is a great thing</strong>. It means students can easily skip class &#8212; any sensible person would. Being able to skip class frees them to do internships, visit the National Museum, explore the off-campus world however they want. My friend took advantage of this to do three internships. At Berkeley I told students to take as few classes as possible and take as many internships as possible. I taught a class called Psychology and the Real World whose sole purpose was to help students learn off campus. When I was a freshman at Caltech, the school had an unintentionally similar feature: all freshman grades were pass/fail. This made it much easier to skip class, which I did most of the time. Even better than the Chinese system, I no longer had to study much. I used my abundant free time to explore my own interests, which included reading Veblen and Freud. I taught psychology to under-privileged eighth-graders. The freedom provided by pass/fail grading allowed me to explore my own interests and started me on the path to becoming an experimental psychologist. I am not kidding: this is a great hidden strength of Chinese higher education.</p>
<p>By the same twisted logic am I <strong>glad</strong> that American colleges are <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/05/occupation-from-wall-street-to-the-university/">becoming insufferably expensive</a> &#8212; because then fewer people will attend them? Not yet. I think most American high school students think not attending college is dangerous. Reading the textbook at home and doing an internship isn&#8217;t dangerous.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In the Frontiers of Psychology class I teach at Tsinghua (Monday 3:20-4:55, Teaching Building 6, Room A113, visitors welcome) , the students will give several presentations each class period. So I decided to assemble a list of advice. I came up with Items 1-3, the students came up with the rest.</p>
<ol>
<li>Give a presentation that you would like to hear. Don&#8217;t worry about following a formula.</li>
<li>Make your points by telling stories. Don&#8217;t just say &#8220;X is true&#8221;. Tell a story that will make your listeners think that X is true.</li>
<li>Stay within the allotted time (e.g., 5 minutes). In real life &#8212; presentations at scientific conferences, for example &#8212; most presentations are too long. Listeners rarely like this. They think the speaker is selfish. If one person speaks too long, this usually means that other speakers will have less time to speak.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t read your talk.</li>
<li>Use simple, spoken English. Don&#8217;t speak fast</li>
<li>Smile and use body language to connect with the audience.</li>
<li>Pause before the most important points.</li>
<li>Ask questions to attract attention.</li>
<li>Show the big structure of your talk.</li>
<li>When telling a story, don&#8217;t go far from the point of the story (e.g., with unnecessary details)</li>
</ol>
<p>To me, the most interesting item is #8 (ask questions). For example, instead of saying &#8220;Let us begin&#8221; I can say &#8220;Shall we begin?&#8221; Which is certainly an improvement over coughing, which is what one student said was the usual way officials began talks.</p>
<p>For example, which phrasing works better?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Why does question-asking work?</em> I asked my students.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I asked my students why question-asking works.</p>
<p>The first way (&#8220;Why does&#8221;) grabs my attention more than the second (&#8220;I asked&#8221;). I did ask my students why it works. One said that when you hear a question you automatically try to answer it.  I cannot do better than that. I suppose we notice questions much like we notice loud noises.</p>

					<p>Yesterday was the first day of one of my Tsinghua classes. It has about 25 students. I asked each of them to say their favorite book in English. Several were mentioned twice: <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (mentioned three times), <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>, <em>The Little Prince</em>, and &#8212; this surprised me &#8212; <em>The Secret</em>. The last student to answer this question said her favorite book was <em>Lolita. </em>The class oohed. Last year a student said his favorite book was <em>Ulysses</em>. I said my favorite book was <a href="http://www.portifex.com/BSPages/Cities&amp;Wealth.htm"><em>Cities and the Wealth of Nations</em></a>. (A close second is <a href="http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/Tottochan.pdf"><em>Totto-Chan</em></a>.)</p>

					<p>I recently heard Tucker Max speak about writing books. He said he had succeeded because he told the truth about himself &#8212; including the unpleasant stuff. Most people don&#8217;t. That, plus an ability to make it entertaining, was what he could do that other people couldn&#8217;t. He was saying that &#8220;being yourself&#8221; &#8212; more precisely, building on how you are different &#8212; was the only good place to start. Imitating other people is not a good place to start. Jane Jacobs said the same thing about how cities should develop. She said it was pointless to try to imitate other cities &#8212; to imitate them by building a stadium or convention center, for example. Each city should figure out what its unique strengths are &#8212; what makes Springfield Springfield &#8212; and build on them. Amplify them. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/08/21/tucker-max-on-writing-and-the-importance-of-understanding-how-you-differ/#more-3794" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Tuesday, August 9th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/03/08/top-and-bottom-versus-middle/">My explanation of the Ten Commandments</a> is that someone at the top (Moses) was trying to convince people at the bottom to join him. People at the bottom were being preyed upon. &#8220;Thou shalt not steal&#8221; meant, to Moses&#8217;s audience, &#8220;no one will steal from you &#8212; or at least we, your leaders, will discourage it.&#8221; At the very beginning of <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp">the Code of Hammarabi</a>, another ancient set of rules, it says one purpose of the rules is &#8220;so that the strong will not harm the weak&#8221;.</p>
<p>I keep seeing this pattern &#8212; people at or near the top of the hierarchy making common cause with people on the bottom against people in the middle. I was reminded of it by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/world/asia/08china.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One anecdote described a Hu Yaobang [top Chinese leader] visit that Mr. Wen arranged with Guizhou Province villagers — secretly, he wrote, because Hu Yaobang did not trust local leaders to let them speak freely.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s, the U.S. civil rights movement gained considerable force and accomplishment when the very top of the government (first, President Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy, later President Johnson) weighed in on the side of the protesters (bottom) against the various state governments (middle).</p>
<p>The practical value of this alignment of forces is illustrated by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Walk-School-Neighborhood-Renaissance/dp/1442200006">How to Walk to School</a>, a book about school reform (which I reviewed <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/03/08/top-and-bottom-versus-middle/">here</a>). Two mothers of young children, Jacqueline Edelberg and another woman, wanted to improve their neighborhood schools before it was too late for their own children to benefit. On the face of it, this was impossible. But they found common cause with the principal of a local school (Susan Kurland). It goes unmentioned in the book but my impression, reading between the lines, is that the main thing that happened is that the worst teachers were shamed into leaving, above all by parents sitting in their classrooms. The principal alone could do nothing about terrible teachers; the parents alone could do nothing; together they did a lot. I spoke to Edelberg about this and she agreed with me.</p>
<p>I point out this pattern because it works. Judaism (Moses) still exists; people still read the Old Testament. Even more powerfully, all governments have lists of laws (Hammurabi). Jacqueline Edelberg&#8217;s neighborhood school is much better. The next big revolution in human affairs, I believe, will be health care. The current system, in which people pay vast amounts for drugs that barely work, have awful side effects, and leave intact the root cause (e.g., too little dietary omega-3), will be replaced by a much better system. The much better system will be some version of paleo. As <a href="http://www.workoutconditioning.com/?p=1072">Woody Allen predicted</a>, people will come to believe that butter is health food. </p>
<p>How will it happen? I suspect this pattern will be the driving force. People at the top and people at the bottom will put pressure on people in the middle. Self-experimentation, self-quantification, and personal science (which overlap greatly) are tools of people at the bottom. They cost nothing, they are available to all. When you track (quantify and record) your health problem, and show your doctor, via numbers and graphs, that the drug he prescribed didn&#8217;t work, that puts pressure on him. When you bring your doctor numbers and graphs that show a paleo solution did work, that puts even more pressure on him. The point, if it isn&#8217;t obvious, is that numbers and graphs, based on carefully collected day-after-day data, amplify what one person can do. Not just what they can learn, not just how healthy they can be, but how much they can influence others. And this amplification of influence, which I never discuss, may ultimately be the most important.</p>
