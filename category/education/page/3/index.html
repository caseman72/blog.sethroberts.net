				<small>Saturday, July 6th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>The first class of Tsinghua psychology majors in a half-century is graduating in a few days. (The Tsinghua psychology department was closed in the 1950s &#8212; Soviet-style university reorganization &#8212; and reopened in 2008.) The seniors asked their professors for statements to be included in a memento book. My contribution:</p>
<blockquote><p>I remember <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2009/09/22/tsinghua-curiosities-first-day-of-class/" target="_blank">our first day of class</a> (Frontiers of Psychology). It was my first time teaching in China. It was on a Monday, maybe it was your first class at Tsinghua. Some things surprised me. Moving from students in the front row to students in the back, English ability got worse. Each student said their name. When one student said her Chinese name, everyone laughed. I still do not understand this. This had never happened in my American classes. A student had her picture taken with me. This too never happened in America. There were two graduate students in the class. <strong>Both</strong> of them volunteered to be teaching assistants. In America, no graduate students attended my undergraduate classes, and you need to pay them a lot of money to be teaching assistants. (At Tsinghua, that was the only time graduate students came to my class.) The graduate student who became my teaching assistant told you, &#8220;Don&#8217;t say <i>My English is poor</i>. Say <i>My English is on the way.</i>&#8221; I can tell you now I disagree. It is confusing to say <i>My English is on the way</i>. There is nothing wrong with saying <i>My English is poor</i>. I say 我的汉语不很好 all the time. We were all so new that we weren&#8217;t sure when class ended! That was the first thing you made me learn: The length of a class period. I enjoyed having dinner with you. You were less afraid of me than my Berkeley students. I especially remember dinner with 徐胜眉, who told me the Chinese side of the debate about the Chinese takeover of Tibet. Most people in America, including professors like me, had no idea there is another side. I had had a big gap in my knowledge and hadn&#8217;t even realized it. The most important thing I learned from you was how to teach better. The homework you did was very good but I was puzzled how to grade it. From talking with you at dinner and listening to you in class, I could tell that all of you were excellent students. It did not seem like a good idea to make it difficult to get the highest grade, but what was the alternative? This was the puzzle that you pushed me to solve. Eventually I changed how I teach quite a bit, as you may know from talking to students from <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">last year&#8217;s Frontiers of Psychology</a>. Thank you for that, and may you teach your future teachers as well as you taught me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because my students were so good, they made me see the deficiencies in usual teaching methods especially clearly. It really did seem idiotic to take perfectly good work and carefully divide it into piles of best, good, and less good (and give each pile a different grade). Surely there were better uses of my time than making such distinctions and better uses of their time and mental energy than trying to do exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>When I visited Berkeley to be considered for an assistant professor job, one of the interviews was with graduate students. One of them asked, &#8220;Which do you like better, teaching or research?&#8221; &#8220;Research,&#8221; I said. They laughed. All Berkeley professors prefer research, but you&#8217;re supposed to say you like them equally. I was unaware of this. I did like research more, and still do, which is why I am surprised that I talk about teaching so much. I told a friend at lunch recently that it was weird how much I talk about my teaching ideas.</p>

				<small>Sunday, June 16th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Linear B is an ancient form of Greek, used around 1500 BC (the Bronze Age) in Mycenean Greece. Stuff written in Linear B gives us one of our oldest views of human life and can reveal things that other ways of looking at the past (e.g., bones, genes, tools, pottery) cannot. At the end of <em>The Riddle of the Labyrinth</em> (2013) by Margalit Fox, a book about how Linear B was deciphered, is a section about what the deciphered tablets turned out to say.</p>
<p>One thing they revealed is considerable occupational specialization. According to Fox  (pp. 273-5),</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece" target="_blank">Mycenaeans</a> plied a range of trades. Many tablets reveal the names of occupations . . . metalsmiths . . . textile work . . . tanners . . . leatherworkers . . . priests and priestesses . . . soldiers, rowers, and archers . . . swordmakers and bowmakers, chariot makers and chariot-wheel repairmen . . . goldsmiths and perfumers . . . woodcutters, carpenters, shipbuilders and net makers; fire kindlers and bath attendants; heralds, hunters, herdsmen, and beekeepers. . . . bronzesmiths.</p></blockquote>
<p>Occupational specialization is at the center of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/61801724/How-Economics-Shaped-Human-Nature-by-Seth-Roberts" target="_blank">my theory of human evolution</a>. The decipherment of Linear B showed that it has existed as far back as we can see. Today there is an enormous amount of occupational specialization, but it also flourished when accumulated knowledge was much less.</p>
<p>The more you see the centrality of occupational specialization to human nature, the more you will see how modern schooling malnourishes almost everyone who undergoes it &#8212; which is almost everyone. Human nature takes people at one place and time &#8212; such as Mycenaean Greece &#8212; and pushes them to become adults who do all sorts of different things (woodcutter, herald, beekeeper . . . ). It takes people who start off the same or almost the same &#8212; same place, same food, same weather, similar genes &#8212; and creates diversity among them. Modern education tries to do the opposite: Take a diverse set of students and make them the same. One example is No Child Left Behind. Another is that in almost every college class, all students are given the same material, the same assignments, and graded on the same one-dimensional scale. We don&#8217;t need everyone to be the same; in fact, we need exactly the opposite. The more diverse we are, the sooner we will find solutions to pressing problems, because they will be attacked in many different ways.</p>

					<p>Long ago, a friend told me that when she was in first grade, she had a lot of pennies. She knew how to add but not subtract so after she spent some, she would have to count them again to know how many were left.</p>
<p>I have finally reached the last lesson (Lesson 12) in my beginning Chinese textbook, which I have been using (fitfully) for more than a year. Later lessons build on earlier lessons. When I didn&#8217;t know a word in a later lesson, I scanned the new-word lists from earlier lessons to find it. I have just discovered there is a word index.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, April 17th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Jenijoy La Belle is a Professor of English at Caltech. Her tenure case, which started in the 1970s, is the main topic of <a href="http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/175/1/La_Belle,_J._OHO.pdf">this interview</a>. Because of one person &#8212; Robert Huttenback &#8212; she was at first denied tenure. Amazingly, she managed to get tenure anyway. In the middle of the fight, which promised to become very embarrassing to Caltech, Huttenback became Chancellor of UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Here is a related story from <a href="http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/200/1/Smith,_Annette_OHO.pdf" target="_blank">another interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One day on a Saturday or Sunday, I was in Baxter [Baxter Hall of Social Sciences and] picking up my mail upstairs. There was nobody else there but Huttenback and a young Turk— a young professor of economics, I guess, who is now of course a famous full professor somewhere, perhaps even retired. They were in the office that Jenijoy was going to have and next to it was the men’s toilet. And they were talking about playing a joke. The goal was to make the situation as uncomfortable—more than uncomfortable, offensive—for Jenijoy as possible. And I will not—I remember exactly what they were doing, but it is so crude that I will not tell you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is one of La Belle&#8217;s comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1982, someone sent me a clipping from the Santa Barbara News and Review, from a column that sounded more like gossip than news. But it simply began: “Even in UCSB circles familiar with Chancellor Robert Huttenback’s perquisites of power, the situation has caused comment. Why do university cars and drivers transport Freda Huttenback, his better half, on personal business? Campus employees, from maintenance to clerical workers, tell us of receiving a Xeroxed map to the Huttenbacks’ home and directions to chauffeur her wherever she asks. These trips have reportedly included visits to a Ventura chiropractor. “Huttenback defends the practice by calling his wife a consultant to the university on interior design matters, saying that she occasionally needs a university car and driver for decorating business. Huttenback first denied he or his wife ever used the car for personal errands: ‘Whoever told you that must be someone I fired,’ was his reply.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Huttenback was eventually convicted of fraud. He defends himself </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/156/1/Huttenback_OHO.pdf" target="_blank">here</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span></p>

				<small>Tuesday, April 16th, 2013</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A California assemblyman named Scott Wilk has proposed a &#8220;New University of California&#8221; whose only purpose would be to provide certification tests &#8212; tests that show you have learned the material of this or that college class. Here is what <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_1301-1350/ab_1306_bill_20130222_introduced.html" target="_blank">his bill</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) The New University of California shall provide no instruction, but shall issue college credit and baccalaureate and associate degrees to any person capable of passing examinations.</p>
<p>(2) The New University of California is authorized to contract with qualified entities for the formulation of peer-reviewed course examinations the passage of which would demonstrate that the student has the knowledge and skill necessary to receive college credit for that course.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not online education. You can learn the material however you want &#8212; for example, by reading a book.</p>
<p>An unsigned <em>New York Times</em> editorial called the idea &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/opinion/sunday/resurrecting-californias-public-universities.html?_r=0" target="_blank">particularly ludicrous</a>&#8221; but did not say why. I think it&#8217;s a good idea. It gives students much more power: They can choose the learning methods and materials and times that fit them best (listening to lectures at work, for example), in contrast to the one-class-fits-all approach at almost all colleges. The cost in time and money will be much less than attending a typical university. The proposal helps employers because passage of these tests reflects a skill useful in many jobs: ability to learn on one&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>Compared to an ordinary college degree (say, from Berkeley), a degree or certification from the New University of California fails to show that you did well enough in high school to get admitted to Berkeley. This could be remedied by showing your prospective employer a letter of admittance to Berkeley.</p>

					<p><em>In January I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">blogged</a> about teaching a class in a new way. The obvious novelty was that I did no grading, but I was also pleased by the high quality of the student work.</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 13px;">The class, at Tsinghua University, is called Foundations of Psychology. It&#8217;s required of psychology majors and is taken by freshmen. Last time there were about 25 students. The biggest assignment was </em><em style="font-size: 13px;">a final project where I allowed students to work on their own interests. They could do almost anything they wanted related to psychology and they could work alone or with others. I &#8220;graded&#8221; their work via a checklist: X points for doing this, Y points for doing that, and so on, with the possible points adding up to an A. The checklist was different for every project. They had about five weeks.</em></p>
<p><em>Here is a summary of one project, by Vista Zeng:</em></p>
<p>In the Frontiers of Psychology class this term, we, a group of three freshmen (Vista Zeng, Joy Wu and Michael Wu) conducted an experiment on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoi_fandom" target="_blank">Fujoshi</a>. Fujoshi is a subculture that started in Japan and spread in East Asia. It has influenced many of our classmates and friends. When recruiting participants, we found 14 Fujoshis out of about 720 female students in Tsinghua University. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/04/09/why-fujoshi-experiment-by-tsinghua-freshmen/#more-10033" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>A friend of mine taught at Harvard for a few years. Her husband needed a job, so he taught a writing class. He said his students were so bad it appeared to be an experiment: <em>How stupid can you be and succeed at Harvard? </em>They had not been admitted based on SAT scores or grades, that was clear. In <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/">a recent article called &#8220;The Myth of American Meritocracy&#8221;</a>, Ron Unz described considerable evidence of exactly what my friend&#8217;s husband noticed: Harvard admission not based on the usual &#8220;meritocratic&#8221; measures, such as SAT scores and grades. For example, he found evidence of an Asian quota. If Asians weren&#8217;t penalized for being Asian, far more would be admitted.</p>

					<p>An American writer named James McGregor (in <em>One Billion Customers</em>) called China &#8220;a nation of bookworms&#8221;. In China, entry into college is heavily controlled by a nationwide test called the <em>gao kao</em> taken near the end of high school. For hundreds of years, China had the most sophisticated civil service entrance exams in the world. Chinese students study much harder than American students. Amy Chua&#8217;s <em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</em> (in which a mother puts a huge amount of pressure on her daughters to succeed in conventional ways) was presented by Chua as reflecting Chinese parenting values. It&#8217;s true that Chinese parents push their children much harder to do well in school than American parents.</p>
<p>All of which might lead unsuspecting Americans to believe that Chinese people value being a good student. Not at all. A Chinese friend explained to me that being called &#8220;a good student&#8221; is essentially an insult. &#8220;You are a good student&#8221; is what you say to someone when you can&#8217;t think of anything nice to say. It means</p>
<p>1. You are not interesting.</p>
<p>2. You have no sense of humor.</p>
<p>3. You have no interests outside of school.</p>
<p><em>Drone</em> might be the closest English equivalent to the Chinese &#8220;good student&#8221;, except that no one would ever say to someone &#8220;you are a drone&#8221; and the meaning of the term has recently changed (to mean mini-planes flown remotely).</p>

					<p>Last semester I taught Academic Writing to Tsinghua undergraduates (psychology majors). Two earlier posts (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/05/how-to-write-lessons-from-my-writing-class/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/06/how-to-write-what-one-student-learned/" target="_blank">here</a>) summarized what they learned. This post is about what I learned.</p>
<p>When I was an undergraduate, I hated the writing assignments I was given, most of them in English classes. I would have to become nauseous with fear before beginning them. I had nothing to say. When I became a professor and had something to say, everything changed. Writing was easy. This is why &#8212; in spite of believing <em>the best way to learn is to do</em> &#8212; I gave my students only one actual writing assignment: write a personal statement, which they had to do for graduate school applications. On the last day of class, I asked them: If I had assigned you to write something, what would you have written? Answers varied from diary entries to a literature review about nuclear panic. Then I asked them if they would have preferred a class like that. Half said yes, half said no. If I teach the class again, I would make it an option: do the regular homework assignments, or write and revise something you want to write.</p>

					<p><em>After <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">my post about how I stopped grading</a>, Eric Chown, who teaches computer science at Bowdoin, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/#comment-1085760" target="_blank">said he did something similar</a>. In upper division courses, he wrote, &#8220;All that matters is student engagement. When students are engaged . . .  my job is to stay out of their way.&#8221; I asked him for details. His reply:</em></p>
<p><strong>Independent Study</strong>: I run a lot of them. Many are in areas that I&#8217;m not an expert in. This started out of necessity &#8211; some of our students wanted to learn things that we simply do not have in our curriculum and if they were exceptional students I knew they&#8217;d be able to learn those things on their own. Over the years I&#8217;ve come to see that all any of our students need to succeed in an independent study is a high level of motivation. I make sure they have picked a useful topic and are sufficiently motivated and have a general plan. After that I turn them loose. I meet with them once a week to see where they are. I rarely give them explicit assignments. I&#8217;m almost never disappointed by what they learn and accomplish. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/29/giving-computer-science-students-freedom/#more-9031" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/01/26/my-ideas-about-teaching-put-into-practice/" target="_blank">my last post</a> I described the result of giving my students more freedom. The more freedom I gave them, the harder it became to grade them. So I stopped grading them &#8212; giving them even more freedom. Here is what the director Steven Soderbergh said in <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/steven-soderbergh-in-conversation.html" target="_blank">a recent interview </a>about giving actors freedom:</p>
<blockquote><p>INTERVIEWER You’ve talked at length about giving actors as much freedom as possible. That’s resulted in a number of performances that have launched, revived, and revitalized careers. In the case of Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight, you’re responsible for her only good film performance.</p>
<p>SODERBERGH It’s not that I never say no; I’m just not trying to control them. I’m looking to amplify and showcase whatever it is about them that I find compelling.</p></blockquote>
<p>I assume that each of my students wants to learn something (related to the class).  I try to make use of that desire rather than push them to learn something else.  Whatever my students are good at, I want to make them better at. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/12/my-theory-of-human-evolution-business-book-edition/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an old post of mine about how this way of teaching resembles the way good managers manage.</p>

					<p>I believe two things about teaching:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. <strong>The best way to learn is to do.</strong> From <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/halmos.pdf" target="_blank">an article by Paul Halmos</a> about teaching math. I began self-experimentation to learn how to do experiments.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Everyone&#8217;s different</strong>. <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">My theory of human evolution</a> says we changed in many ways to facilitate trading. (For example, language began as advertising.)  The more diverse the expertise within a group, the more members of the group can benefit from trade. Following this logic, mechanisms evolved to increase diversity of expertise among people living in the same place with the same genes.  (For example, a mechanism that causes procrastination.) The theory implies that there is something inside every student that pushes them toward expertise &#8212; they <strong>want</strong> to learn &#8212; but they are being pushed in many different directions &#8212; what they want to learn varies greatly.  If you accommodate the latter (diversity in what students want to learn), you can take advantage of the former (an inner drive to learn).</p></blockquote>
<p>The novelty is #2 &#8212; the idea that #2 is relevant to teaching. Human nature: People who are the same want to be different. Formal education: People who are different should be the same.  At Berkeley, most professors appeared to have little idea of the diversity of their students. (At least I didn&#8217;t, until I gave assignments that revealed it.) Almost all classes treated all students in a class the same: same lectures, same assignments, same tests, same grading scheme. I heard dozens of talks about how to teach. Supporting or encouraging individuality never came up. Now and then I told other professors these ideas &#8212; at a party, for example. &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s different, but our classes treat everyone the same,&#8221; I&#8217;d say. No one agreed. It was a new and apparently distasteful idea. <em>Too much work</em> was one response.</p>

					<p>Amy Chua wondered if all the pressure to practice (piano, older child, violin, younger child) she put on her two children was worth it. But then there were moments like these:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="calibre9" data-mce-mark="1">In a glass-windowed room overlooking the Mediterranean, Sophia played Mendelsohn&#8217;s <em>Rondo Capriccioso</em>, and got bravos and hugs from all the guests.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Which I found the most chilling sentence in the whole book. Her daughter&#8217;s recognition (&#8220;bravos and hugs&#8221;) made Chua very happy. But did it make Sophia happy? Chua doesn&#8217;t answer that question. She doesn&#8217;t follow the sentence I&#8217;ve quoted with &#8220;I could see how pleased she was&#8221; or &#8220;Years later she would say what a good time she had&#8221;. Nope, the chapter ends there.</p>
