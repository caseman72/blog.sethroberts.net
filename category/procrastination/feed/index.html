				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reader named Niles McAdams, who told me about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/03/bedtime-honey-increases-strength/?preview=true" target="_blank">his strength increase from bedtime honey</a>, also wrote about his experience with <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/wp-admin/edit.php?category_name=magic-dots" target="_blank">magic dots</a> (a way to mark progress):</p>
<blockquote><p>I have become a HUGE fan of your Magic Dots idea for many reasons. I started using them to increase the time I spent at my standing desk but since then I&#8217;ve used them to keep my writing and programming projects on track.</p>
<p>Here are some of the advantages of Magic Dots:</p>
<p><strong>They can be customized to the individual</strong>. Instead of using 10 points and lines to make a box with an X in it, I use six points and lines (10 min. increments) to make a triangle. I would imagine for almost any time increment that a person wished to use, a shape could be found. I used 10 minute  increments but one wouldn’t have to &#8212; imagine, for example, a grade school child studying a spelling test.  The parent could ask the child to study for one triangle or ½ hour where each dot or line represents a 5 minute increment. There are many many shape and increment possibilities &#8211; enough for any person or task.</p>
<p><strong>They are mostly an intellectual tool not a physical tool</strong>. One doesn&#8217;t need a laptop, tablet, smart phone, Fitbit or any other modern technology to use Magic Dots. One could scratch them out in the dirt with a stick if need be (and in fact, I may do just that when it comes time to weed my garden next spring). Of course you need some way of telling time so a watch is  handy but if the sun is shining you don&#8217;t even need that – a vertical stick in the ground and a few scratches in the ground could record the passage of time well enough. It goes without saying they don’t need electricity &#8212; pencil, paper and watch or clock and you are in business. </p>
<p><strong>They can be used to show work history</strong>. For a while, I would mark my Magic Dots horizontally, side by side,  on a piece of paper. Each new day I would start a new line. This allowed me to see at a glance how much standing I had done during the week.</p>
<p><strong>They can be used to show work by category</strong>. A few times I have drawn vertical lines on the paper to represent different work categories, e.g., writing versus programming. I combined this with the line per day technique above. At a glance I could see “on Tuesday I had 3 triangles standing, 2 triangles writing, and 1 triangle programming.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Govind M., the Stanford grad student <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/14/benefits-of-brown-noise/" target="_blank">who recommended brown noise</a>, has good things to say about magic dots:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been using magic dots for about two months now and they work. I have no idea why they work &#8212; maybe it&#8217;s the reinforcement &#8212; but they do. I enjoy making them and for me, I have to finish them. I use 9 min/mark for 90 min intervals, which also provides a very easy way to track time. A four box day is enormously productive, though the fourth box typically gets torpedoed by a meeting or something.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of magic dots is that instead of setting down an intimidating 90-minute chunk of time, my mental horizon is shortened to the next 9 minutes. After that, the box takes over. So in situations in which (1) it is difficult to get started and (2) I want to add structure to the day, I use magic dots.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked, &#8220;When you are using the magic dots, do you work for longer periods of time before taking a break?&#8221; Govind said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes. However, it is possible that goal gets shifted from &#8220;be focused and attentive and not goofing off on facebook&#8221; to &#8220;work long enough make 10 marks on a piece of paper.&#8221; It makes it easier to start and to continue on working.</p></blockquote>
<p>I too find that magic dots make it easier to start work. I think this happens because the task in front of me (getting work done) seems more doable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Jersey patent attorney named Jim D writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been using the magic dots as you described, marking a dot or line every six minutes. I use an online timer with an audible tone every six minutes. A portion of my work requires focus, as I have to review, compare and contrast technical documents. I&#8217;ve historically had limited ability to focus for extended periods of time. I&#8217;ve used an online bar graph countdown timer, but even with the visual feedback of the bar graph counting down, the longest I could go without a short break was 20 minutes. I&#8217;ve also tried online Pomodoro timers, with alternating work and break periods, but again, the longest I could go without a break was 20 minutes.</p>
<p>In contrast, by using the magic dots method, I can easily focus for 60 minutes. I&#8217;ve been working for 60 minutes until the box is completed, and then taking a short break before starting another 60 minute box. After a few more weeks, I will see if I can extend the focus length for a longer period of time. (As an aside, I wonder if completing an entire &#8220;box&#8221; is psychologically important, and, if so, would a 90 minute &#8220;box&#8221; shape work better than continuing with consecutive 60 minute boxes?).</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think finishing a box matters. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t seem to make a difference. A friend used a much different counting system; it also worked. After years of using six-minute intervals I have started to use five-minute intervals; they don&#8217;t interfere too much and shorter intervals are likely to be more powerful. I would like to compare different interval lengths but it is a difficult experiment to do.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve posted <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/procrastination/magic-dots/" target="_blank">several times</a> about the use of what I call &#8220;magic dots&#8221; to get things done. You make a dot or line every six minutes of work. I use the counting method shown above. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1338316/" target="_blank">The effect</a> was first seen in pigeons. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/528888" target="_blank">A similar effect</a> was discovered (by accident) in rats.</p>
<p>It works amazingly well. &#8220;The magic dots have been magic,&#8221; said <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/15/magic-dots-user-experience/" target="_blank">a user named Joan</a>. It would be nice to know why &#8212; maybe the effect can be made even stronger. Joan commented in an email:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been thinking about why this has worked for me &#8211; I think it&#8217;s that there is an almost immediate &#8220;reward&#8221;, so I get started right away. Since the reward does not have any associations, there&#8217;s no inner conflict sabotaging it. For instance, I might feel guilty if I ate a jelly bean every 6 minutes, or I might just eat them anyway. I&#8217;m not &#8220;deprived&#8221; if I don&#8217;t get to add more dots and lines, and I know I can just get back to work and start writing dots again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly the dots &#8211; or the act of making a dot &#8212; act as a reward. But why? If I&#8217;m writing something, why do the dots have an effect when I can already see my progress by looking at what I&#8217;ve written? I&#8217;m <strong>already</strong> making marks.</p>
<p>The consistency of the marks &#8212; the same mark, again and again &#8212; may make a difference. Presumably the brain needs to notice a correlation: Writing (or whatever the difficult task is) produces both marks and progress (= a sense of satisfaction). Other activities produce neither. The more identical the marks, the easier to see the correlation. When I write, there is not one consistent mark of progress.</p>
<p>Maybe other people have independently discovered this, without knowing about the pigeon results. Their methods might shed light on what you need to do to get the effect. I don&#8217;t know of any independent discoveries. The closest thing I can think of is most computer games provide markers of your progress throughout the game, such as level advancement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Previous posts about the magic dots method of getting work done are <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/procrastination/magic-dots/" target="_blank">here</a>. Recently, Patrick Dwyer, a solo-practitioner lawyer in Chicago, started using them. He explained how they help:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I use the magic dots for brief writing it helps me in a few ways. First, it is much less intimidating to set a goal to write for 15 minutes than for 50 hours. Second, it also does not seem so bad to work for just a few more minutes when I am bored or out of ideas rather than wait for that elusive &#8220;flow.&#8221; Third, it gives me an ability to keep a precise account of my time and what I was doing so that I can show the client a specific task when I send the bill. Fourth, after I have made several boxes at the end of a day, it gives me a sense of accomplishment. All these things help me not to procrastinate. There is also something pleasing about drawing the boxes which seems to be more satisfying than merely writing non-graphic sentences or notes about my time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with all this, but would add that the method was suggested to me by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1338316/" target="_blank">pigeon research</a> in which none of these factors could have mattered (e.g., pigeons do not bill clients). If the pigeon research and the magic dots method really involve the same mechanism &#8212; which seems to be true &#8212; then that mechanism is remarkably old. According to <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110303205452AAQJ3x1" target="_blank">this</a>, the common ancestor of birds and humans lived 300 million years ago. Maybe it is hard to notice the mechanism because it is buried so deep in our brains. </p>
<p>Animal learning researchers have always said that by studying animals (such as rats and pigeons) we will learn about humans. This example supports that claim. (As does the Shangri-La Diet.) The pigeon research, which had a very counter-intuitive result, led me to try the magic dots method, which seems like it can&#8217;t possibly work, but did. Yet when this actually happened it was hard to notice. I talked about the pigeon results, which I thought were astonishing, for many years before I realized they might help me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1338316/" target="_blank">research by Neuringer and Chung</a>, I started marking my work progress by <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/07/04/magic-dots-quasi-reinforcement-helps-get-things-done/">making a mark (such as a dot) every six minutes of work</a>. I did it for difficult tasks, such as writing. Neuringer and Chung found that markers of progress made pigeons peck twice as much. The dots seemed to enable <strong>me</strong> to work twice as much &#8212; e.g., twice as long.</p>
<p>I think a friend came up with the name <em>magic dots</em>. It did seem magic that such a tiny thing &#8212; making a dot on a piece of paper &#8212; could be so useful. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/26/anti-procrastination-software-available/" target="_blank">A recent post about procrastination software</a> led a reader named Joan to start using it. I&#8217;ve already described <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/15/magic-dots-user-experience/" target="_blank">her experience</a> (&#8220;the magic dots have been magic&#8221;) and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/23/magic-dots-more-user-experience/" target="_blank">someone else&#8217;s experience</a> here.</p>
<p>Two more people have told me about their experience. I&#8217;ll describe what one of them said today and what the other one said tomorrow. Alex Chernavsky wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I tried the Magic Dots system yesterday, and I liked it a lot. I ended up with two-and-a-half completed squares. I was more productive than usual.  (By the way, have you heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro technique</a>?  It&#8217;s similar.) I didn&#8217;t use a stopwatch. I download an iPhone app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/interval-timer-for-fitness/id406473568?mt=8" target="_blank">Interval Timer</a>, by Delta Works. It&#8217;s free, but it shows small, unobtrusive ads. I set it to do continuously-repeating six-minute countdowns. The end of each cycle is marked by a short vibration. The iPhone screen stays lit-up the whole time that the application is running, so you can easily check the remaining time. If I remember to glance at the screen, I will make a mark if the application shows a remaining time of less than three minutes. If I forget to check, I make a mark when I hear the vibration. I was home alone most of the day, and I was able to get a lot of work done. I didn&#8217;t use the technique when I was doing menial chores, like washing dishes. I only used it when I was working at my desk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alex also asked several questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>What happens if you end up getting distracted by a non-productive, time-wasting activity, like checking Facebook? Should you reset the six-minute countdown cycle back to the beginning, or&#8230;?</p></blockquote>
<p>I would just stop the stopwatch, not reset the timer. I would hate to lose the 2 minutes or whatever.</p>
<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s the best way to account for unplanned, unintentional changes in focus from one productive activity (e.g., balancing your checkbook) to a different productive activity (e.g., replying to important email messages)?</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t change anything, as long as I am being productive I keep racking up the dots.</p>
<blockquote><p>What happens if you need to take a bathroom break or other short break? Should you pause the timer?</p></blockquote>
<p>No, I count anything necessary, including bathroom breaks and making tea. This is one reason I like the method: getting credit for making tea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2012 I posted about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/07/04/magic-dots-quasi-reinforcement-helps-get-things-done/" target="_blank">using &#8220;magic dots&#8221; to get work done</a>. You make a mark on a piece of paper every six minutes you work. The idea derives from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1338316/" target="_blank">the quasi-reinforcement effect of Neuringer and Chung</a>. They found that giving pigeons markers of progress toward food, such as a blackout, doubled how much the pigeons pecked for food &#8212; that is, doubled how much they worked.</p>
<p>I found magic dots very helpful. <em>The future will be different from the past </em>was my reaction. (In the future I will get more work done.) So did <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/15/magic-dots-user-experience/" target="_blank">a reader named Joan</a>. Now <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/15/magic-dots-user-experience/#comment-1122391" target="_blank">a reader named David Johnston</a> tells his experience:<span id="more-10699"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m an engineer designing cryptographic digital circuits in microprocessors, which is intellectually challenging but also involves a lot of coding and debugging which requires concentration and attention to detail but is certainly not intellectually challenging. My specialization is random numbers, which even by computer science standards is a very narrow and deep field to specialize in. I don&#8217;t know of anyone else who does what I do. My work environment is saturated with sources of interruption which very much gets in the way of getting work done. If you think my employer is getting something wrong in creating an effective workplace for engineers, you would be correct. Procrastination is a big issue for me and I&#8217;ve tried various approaches to focus better without great success except for the Japanese music thing described below.</p>
<p>So after reading your article I gave it a try, I set up a timer on my computer (Orzeszek Timer) to beep every six minutes and filled out the dots on each beep.</p>
<p>On my first pass I lasted 2.5 hours before I had a meeting to go to and completed a detailed technical diagram of a circuit I was proposing. The next day I did 5 hours (with a lunch break in between) and was coding up the circuit. I stopped due to a meeting and could have continued. The third day I did not get a chance to focus on code or design, so I managed 0 hours. Then the weekend happened.</p>
<p>This is very much not normal for me. I might do 30 minutes to 1 hour before feeling the need to do something else besides concentrating, like dealing with email or getting a coffee. Getting back to it is not an efficient process since you are typically juggling multiple facts (aka the &#8216;working set&#8217;) pertinent to the problem and getting back in that frame of mind takes time. This is well a well documented aspect of computer programming, where there is a warm up time before the programmer becomes productive and then the productive period is fragile and easily set back to the start by interruptions.</p>
<p>I intend to keep trying this method and I hope it proves to be effective over longer periods because succeeding at my job is a lot less stressful than not succeeding. Obviously the vanishingly small investment required to try it is a big factor in making it easy to choose to try it.</p>
<p>So my initial reaction is that it works. My sense is that there is something important about mentally breaking up progress into chunks. I certainly do that on long tasks, e.g. a long drive ( I might envision it as passing the 10%, 20% etc points as we progress) or recently a game (<a href="http://www.ingress.com/" target="_blank">Ingress</a> &#8211; a game you play with a smartphone that requires you get out and walk a lot) where the space between levels doubles. To get to the final level 8 from 7 requires 600,000 points to reach 1.2 million total. Logic would suggest you should just head out and get all the points you can as fast as possible, but that is disheartening because any one day doesn&#8217;t make a big dent. By setting a goal of 10,000 per day, that gave me a mental and physical framework that was effective. I knew when to keep going (less than 10,000 points achieved) and I knew when to stop (at 10,000 points and probably 2 miles walking). Roughly 60 days later I got to the highest level.</p>
<p>While working on design, the beep in my ear and reaching to draw a dot or line on graph paper was not enough to knock off my concentration, but the continuing for the next six minutes felt like an achievable goal, much like 10,000 points in Ingress felt like an achievable goal each day, whereas choosing to sit and concentrate for five hours is a non starter, much as trying to battle through 600,000 points in Ingress is a non starter.</p>
<p>Possibly unrelated, but maybe not &#8211; I have found that I work well listening to Japanese music on headphones (e.g. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC5k3zAWpq0" target="_blank">Happy End</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/artist/tokyo-jihen" target="_blank">Tokyo Jihen</a>). I haven&#8217;t a clue what the words are and so it seems to not interrupt my coding state of mind in the same way that English language music does. The cadence (3-6 minutes per song) is not that far off the quasi-reinforcement time of 6 minutes that was suggested on your website. Also it blocks out the blathering of people near me in the office. I presume it being Japanese has nothing to do with its efficacy. It is just a language that hits zero of my language processing neurons. Any language would do if the music was good.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you find the magic dots <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> work for you, I am just as happy to hear about it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/09/nick-winter-and-percentile-feedback/" target="_blank">One of my recent posts</a> about anti-procrastination software led a reader named Joan to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/07/04/magic-dots-quasi-reinforcement-helps-get-things-done/" target="_blank">an earlier post about magic dots</a>, which is a low-tech way of getting work done. Every six minutes of work, you make a dot or line in a certain pattern on a piece of paper. I got the idea from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1338316/" target="_blank">the quasi-reinforcement effect of Neuringer and Chung</a>. Studying pigeons, they found that markers of progress act like rewards. What was amazing was that they got pigeons to work twice as hard (= peck twice as fast) without increasing their salary (= food reward). The dots mark progress.<span id="more-10640"></span></p>
<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/09/nick-winter-and-percentile-feedback/#comment-1120876" target="_blank">her comment</a>, Joan said</p>
<blockquote><p>This post led me to find the post about the magic dots, which for me [have been] magic. I have a fairly boring job and lots of annoying things I have to take care of for my family, so it’s hard to get going most days. Today I got going right away and stayed on task. I didn’t use a stop-watch, just wrote down the time I started, and created the boxes. I started this yesterday afternoon, so this is one and a half days.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked her for details. She replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have an IT job where I am pretty much self-directed, but one week out of four have to be on-call for production support, which takes up most of the time that week, and I also have to assist the on-call person the other 3 weeks when it&#8217;s an application I own.  Since I spend the on-call week pretty much just monitoring 3 mailboxes, it&#8217;s very hard to focus on the off weeks, and I find myself reading blogs way too much of the time.  Also, some of the production support work is interesting -figuring out what happened and how to fix it, but a lot of it is routine and annoying, like some external server was down, so we have to rerun a job.</p>
<p>I have tried various tools to block the most addictive sites, but am not really supposed to install stuff on my work computer.  The percentage thing looked interesting, but it looked like it would be minor project to implement.  Then I saw the post about magic dots.  I&#8217;m a &#8220;tactile&#8221; learner, which means I like to write stuff on paper, so I thought this would be easy to try and started right away.  I was already trying to keep a list and give myself checkmark rewards, without much success.</p>
<p>So far this week has been great &#8212; I follow this very loosely. I make a list of activities to accomplish between production support calls, including stretching, etc. and anything that is not something to be done immediately. So things that might not be &#8220;work&#8221;, but that I have to get done that day during the day are on the list, and I fill in between support work with this stuff. I count time spent chatting with co-workers, calls to my mother, calls to the bank, even this email.</p>
<p>The first 2 days were pretty hard.  I found myself scanning the list for the least annoying or tiresome tasks, but toward the end of the day I was actually pushing myself to stay and finish a couple of issues that would fit in my time remaining, and empty those in-boxes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not that focused on filling in the dots [= completing a set of 10] as the day goes on, but after every break I start a new one, and note the time I started.</p>
<p>I have no idea why this works, when nothing else seems to have helped.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked what else she had tried. She replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had some success with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/leechblock/" target="_blank">LeechBlock</a>, but had to remove unauthorized apps [LeechBlock is a Firefox addon] from my desktop and [had to stop] using it to stay off the really addictive sites such as <a href="http://ancestry.com/" target="_blank">ancestry.com</a>. Work already blocks most social media sites. I tried using the IE site blocking, but having to enter a password didn&#8217;t seem to deter me.</p>
<p>To try to get motivated and get more done I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affirmations and resolutions. Fail.</li>
<li>Tried using a &#8220;7 habits&#8221; style to do list. Fail.</li>
<li>Putting little mirrors on my desk. No help.</li>
<li>Improve another habit and hope for carryover. I tried food monitoring, and spent too much time researching diets. I am keeping up with exercise goals though.</li>
<li>Looked for support or monitoring sites. Did not find one that seemed like a good fit. Internet addiction forums are mostly about porn or gaming addictions, not <a href="http://ancestry.com/" target="_blank">ancestry.com</a> or paleo diet blogs.</li>
<li>I followed a popular &#8220;personal productivity&#8221; blog for a while, but in the end spent too much time reading the forums. Seems like most of these gurus have always been over-achievers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on statistics I have heard, I&#8217;m only a little above average in internet use at work, but some days I&#8217;m way over.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Saturday and Sunday there was an international Quantified Self Conference at Stanford. I attended. In Gary Wolf&#8217;s introductory talk, he said there are 70 Quantified Self chapters (New York, London, etc.) and 10,000 members. I was especially impressed because I recently counted about 50 chapters. One new chapter is Quantified Self Beijing. It has its first meeting &#8212; in the form of a <a href="http://qsbeijing.wix.com/conference#!d_clients/cqh1">day-long conference</a> &#8212; in nine hours and I haven&#8217;t quite finished my talk (&#8220;Brain Tracking: Why and How&#8221;). Please indulge me while I procrastinate by writing about the Stanford conference.<span id="more-7599"></span></p>
<p>Here are some things that impressed me:</p>
<p>Office hours. A new type of participation this year was &#8220;office hour&#8221;, meaning you sit at a table for an hour. My office hour, during which two people showed up, was the most pleasant and informative hour of the whole conference for me. I thank Janet Chang for suggesting I do this.<br />
<a href="http://www.sublime.org/"><br />
Robin Barooah</a> used a measure of how much he meditated, which he collected via an app he made, to measure his depression. When he was depressed, he didn&#8217;t meditate. Depression is half low mood, half inaction. It is very rare that the inactive side of it is measured. It is so much easier to ask subjects to rate their mood, but this has obvious problems. Robin inadvertently found a way to measure level of activity over long periods of time. He also found that participation in an experiment that tested a PTSD drug caused long-lasting improvement, another idea about depression I&#8217;d never heard before. At dinner, Robin told me that his partner, when they&#8217;re at a restaurant, has sometimes said &#8220;God bless Seth Roberts&#8221; for allowing her to eat butter without guilt.</p>
<p>Steve Jonas, from QS Portland, told me that he spent a long time (many weeks) doing some sort of mental test. During one of those weeks, he consumed butter a la Dave Asprey, in coffee. Much later he analyzed the results, computing an average for every week, and noticed that during the week with butter his performance was distinctly better than performance on other weeks. I hope to learn more about this. Steve also gave a talk about learning stuff using spaced repetition. He noticed that learning new stuff increased his curiosity. After he used spaced repetition to learn stuff about Mali, for example, he became more interested in reading news stories about Mali. I think this is an important conclusion about education, the way rote learning and encouragement of curiosity are not opposites but go together, that I have never heard before.</p>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/06/22/computing-pioneer-larry-smarr.html">Larry Smarr</a>, a computer science professor at UC San Diego, gave a talk called &#8220;Frontiers of Self-Tracking&#8221; centered on his Crohn&#8217;s disease. I was struck by what was missing from his talk. He began self-tracking before the Crohn&#8217;s diagnosis and clearly the self-tracking helped establish the diagnosis. However, you don&#8217;t need to self-track to figure out you have Crohn&#8217;s disease, roughly everyone who has gotten this diagnosis did not self-track. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how much the self-tracking helped. Crohn&#8217;s is generally associated with frequent diarrhea, which is exactly the opposite of hard to notice. Larry said nothing about this. Later he talked about massive amounts of personalized genetic data that he was getting. I couldn&#8217;t see how this data could possibly help him. Isn&#8217;t self-tracking supposed to be helpful? If I had a serious disease, I would want it to be helpful. At the same time, judging from his talk, he seemed to be ignoring the many cases where people have figured out how to better live with their Crohn&#8217;s disease. I would have liked to ask Larry about these gaps at his office hour but I had an eye problem that caused me to miss it.</p>
<p>I asked Nick Winter, cofounder of <a href="http://www.skritter.com/">Skritter</a>, what he thought of the recent Ancestral Health Symposium at Harvard (August 2012), which we both attended. He didn&#8217;t like it much, he said, but it more than justified itself because Chris Kresser&#8217;s talk about iron led him to get his iron checked. It turned out be off-the-charts high. Partly because oysters, partly because of red meat. I think he said he has since donated blood and it came down. I hadn&#8217;t previously heard of this danger of eating red meat. Again I discussed with Nick why he found that butter had a bad effect on his cognitive performance, the opposite of what I found. One possibility is that the butter slowed digestion of his lunch, thus reducing glucose in his blood at the time of the cognitive tests. But this does not explain why a certain drug eliminated the effect of butter.</p>
<p>In his talk, Paul Abramson, a quant-friendly San Francisco doctor, said that mainstream medicine is &#8220;riddled with undisclosed conflicts of interest&#8221;. I hope to learn more about this.</p>
<p>Jon Cousins contributed a neat booklet about what he had learned and not learned from starting <a href="http://www.moodscope.com">Moodscope</a>. What he hadn&#8217;t learned was how to make a sustainable business out of it. I suggested to him that he might be able find professors who would apply for grants with him that would use Moodscope as a research tool. The grants would pay Jon a salary and might include money for software development. Mood disorders are a huge health problem &#8212; depression is sometimes considered the most costly health problem of all, worldwide &#8212; and Moodscope is a new way to do research about them. Paying Jon a salary for a few years would cost much less than assembling a similar-sized sample (Moodscope has thousands of users) from scratch. I wonder how professors who do research on mood disorders will see it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_02451.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6994" title="IMG_0245[1]" alt="" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_02451-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>This photo illustrates a method I have used for many years to get work done, usually writing. Every six minutes of work, I make a dot or line. One hour = 10 marks = a box (counting method from <em>Exploratory Data Analysis</em>). I use a stopwatch. I make a mark when I am more than halfway to the goal. If I glance at the clock and it says 4 minutes (more than halfway to 6 minutes), I make a mark. If I glance at the clock and it says 10 minutes (more than halfway to 12 minutes from 6 minutes), I make a mark. I only zero the clock when I take a break. I use one piece of paper per day.</p>
<p>I devised this. It is based on an effect discovered by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1338316/">Allen Neuringer and Shin-Ho Chung</a> called <em>quasi-reinforcement.</em> Neuringer and Chung studied pigeons. They found that if you give a pigeon food every 500 times it pecks a key, it will peck the key slowly (say, 2 pecks/minute). If you give the pigeon a brief flash of light every 20 pecks &#8212; a marker that shows it is doing the right thing to get food &#8212; it will peck much faster (say, 4 pecks/minute). The flashes of light are quasi-reinforcement, said Neuringer and Chung &#8212; they have some but not all of the properties of ordinary reinforcement, such as food. By themselves, the flashes of light don&#8217;t interest the pigeon. It won&#8217;t peck a key to get them. The amazing thing about this effect is that it doubles how hard the pigeon works without raising its salary.</p>
<p>I noticed improvement &#8212; it was easier to write &#8212; within about 20 minutes the first time I tried this. I chose six minutes as the unit because shorter times were more distracting and longer times less effective.</p>
<p>I told <a href="http://aether.com/">Gary Wolf</a> about the dots method two years ago and he&#8217;s been using it ever since. He says it is good for getting started on something he needs to write. After he gets going, he stops doing it. He uses it as an example of the value of self-tracking. I too find that after I get going on something, I need it less. If I stop, however, I drift backwards toward doing less productive stuff or nothing.</p>
<p>Gary asked me about this a month ago and I started doing it again (instead of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/percentile-feedback/">percentile feedback</a>). I noticed something I had never noticed before, which was that the system lifted my whole energy level and gave me a &#8220;can&#8217;t wait to get started&#8221; feeling in the morning. This too made it easier to get stuff done. It reminded me of some rat research I&#8217;d done. Put a rat in a Skinner box and it will explore for a while. If it doesn&#8217;t get any food,  after a while (10 minutes?) it will stop exploring and curl up in the middle of the box. However, if I give the rat a pellet of food at random times (at the rate of one pellet/minute), it will keep exploring the box indefinitely. Learning psychologists have emphasized that when you reward an action, you make it more likely. The rat experiment I just described suggests a second effect: when you give reward &#8212; at least, when reward is rare &#8212; you make <strong>all</strong> actions more likely. You increase exploration, not just the rewarded response. When I was a young professor I went to a two-week neuroscience program at Dartmouth. It was all lectures. The other attendees were graduate students. I had little in common with them. There was little to do in the town, besides eat Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s. The next town was 8 miles away. I couldn&#8217;t find anything I enjoyed doing. After a week, I had trouble getting out of bed, like the rat curled up in the middle of the Skinner box. A psychiatrist might have said I had major depression. I flew home and was fine.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Evidence is the raw fuel of science: We collect data, it pushes forward our understanding. But there is also <em>anti-evidence</em>: observations that have the effect of holding back our understanding. The clearest example I know comes from experiments that supposedly &#8220;tested&#8221; mathematical learning theories in the 1950s and later. The observation was that the theory could fit the data. Theorists wrote papers to report this observation. In fact, the theory was so flexible it could fit any plausible results. The papers, which were taken seriously, retarded the study of learning because they wasted everyone&#8217;s time. They gave the illusion of progress. Hal Pashler and I <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/763/">wrote about this</a>.</p>
<p>Another example of anti-evidence, I think, is the sort of data that linguistic theorists have been fond of: Observations that this or that sentence or sentence fragment strikes the theorist as grammatical, i.e., possible. Not studies of how people actually talk; the observation that a speaker of English or whatever <em>could</em> say this or that. The theorist&#8217;s judgment based on introspection. I&#8217;m not saying that this isn&#8217;t actual data of some sort; I just suspect that the value of these sorts of observations has been overrated and the net effect has been to keep linguists from collecting data that would push theorizing forward.</p>
<p>Months ago I blogged about how I found that when I made playing a game contingent upon clearing off my kitchen table, I was <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2006/12/28/science-in-action-procrastination-results/">able to clear off the table</a>. Which had been messy for quite a while. My question: is this evidence or anti-evidence? If I think about this, and try to understand it, will I be deluding myself, as the mathematical learning theorists and the linguistic theorists deluded themselves? On its face, it seems like a very ordinary, very narrow observation, much like the observation that &#8220;George played with the game Dave brought over&#8221; is a possible English sentence. On the other hand, it is something unusual and helpful that actually happened, unlike an observation that this or that is a possible English sentence.</p>
<p>When someone says &#8220;the plural of anecdote is not data,&#8221; you can be sure their grasp of scientific method is weak; lots of important discoveries have begun with accidental single observations. But those productive single observations are always surprising. My table-clearing observation was <em>slightly</em> surprising&#8230;</p>

<p>The clearing took about 40 minutes of work and three games of <a href="http://www.websudoku.com/">Sudoku</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A month ago I had lunch with <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2006/02/08_games.shtml">Greg Niemeyer</a>, a professor of art at UC Berkeley whose medium is games. His games have appeared in <a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/niemeyer/bio.html">art galleries all over the world</a>. He asked me if games had been studied by psychologists and pointed out some of their psychological properties &#8212; the power to make you concentrate for a long time, for example.</p>
<p>This was fascinating. He was so right &#8212; games are powerful in several ways. I wondered how that power could be (a) studied and (b) used. My first question was whether games could be a stimulant, like caffeine. I emailed Greg about this; he suggested I try Bejeweled and Sudoku. But I found them tiring &#8212; they require concentration. My next idea was that maybe I could use games as a reward. I used to enjoy Tetris and Freecell. If I do X (something I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise do), then I get to play a game. This contingency causes me to do X. There are dozens of rewards you could use this way (listening to music, eating a piece of chocolate, etc.); the advantages of games include their number and variety, the care put into them, the lack of satiation (you can play the game many times and it remains pleasant), their harmlessness (if I avoided getting addicted), their low cost, the ready supply (you can play a computer game whenever you have a computer), and the short duration of some of them. The reward for a 5-minute task should not last 4 hours.</p>
<p>I have wondered for a long time about procrastination &#8212; what causes it, what to do about it. I like to think I&#8217;ve figured out <a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/2005_diversityinlearning.pdf">a few things</a> but even so certain things I should do seem to go undone . . . well, forever.</p>
<p>For example, a month ago I had 40-odd emails in my inbox, some a few months old. I never got around to clearing it out. Bejeweled was no fun but <a href="http://www.websudoku.com/">Sudoku</a> (Easy level) was okay. I never played Sudoku for fun but it was slightly enjoyable. Maybe I could play a game of Sudoku as reward for answering email. If I made the requirement &#8212; the amount of email that I needed to answer &#8212; small enough, it might work.</p>
<p>It worked. When I made the requirement tiny &#8212; deal with 3 email (which might take 10 minutes) &#8212; that was small enough. And I was able to do it again and again: handle 3 email, play Sudoku, handle 3 email, play Sudoku, etc. Progress was slow &#8212; I spent more time playing Sudoku than dealing with email &#8212; but slow progress was <em>far</em> better than no progress. I was a little stunned it was actually working. After about 10 cycles (which took 3 or 4 hours), my inbox was as empty as I could make it. It hadn&#8217;t been that empty in years. To gather some data about the whole process I wrote some R programs for recording what the task was, how long it took, etc.</p>
<p>Then I started spending all my time revising <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em> for the paperback edition. A few days ago I finished that. My inbox had gotten full again and again I used Sudoku to clear it out.</p>
<p>I want to learn more about this way of getting things done. Does it work with other chores besides email? Here is the kitchen table in my apartment:</p>
<p><img alt="My Kitchen Table 26 December 2006 8 am" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/153/334460889_62f0a6a99b.jpg?v=0" /></p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t usually this messy but it hasn&#8217;t been completely clear for years. Can I use Sudoku to clear it off?</p>
