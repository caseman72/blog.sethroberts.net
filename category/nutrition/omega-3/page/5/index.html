				<small>Monday, January 28th, 2008</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.susanallport.com/">Susan Allport</a> is the author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520253809/sethrobertand-20">The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed from the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them</a></em>, which for me was the best source of introductory information on the subject. Chapter 1 is <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10264/10264.ch01.pdf">here</a>. A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIgNpsbvcVM">video</a>.<br />
<em><br />
What have been the main reactions to your book? </em></p>
<p>The best reaction has been from scientists and the American Oil Chemists Society (AOCS), whose members were happy to have the history of this important research laid out for the public and for themselves.  The book hasn&#8217;t yet caught on with general readers &#8212; in part because the material is somewhat difficult and in part because most people think that the problems with fats are with trans fats or saturated fats or cholesterol: three long detours on the road to dietary understanding, in my opinion.</p>
<p><em>Learned anything since you wrote it that you would include in a revised/expanded edition? </em></p>
<p>I would certainly include a key piece of evidence that has been available for some time but not brought to light. It has to do with the argument that we don&#8217;t elongate and desaturate the parent essential fatty acids very well (the omega-3 fat: alpha linolenic acid and omega-6 fat: linoleic acid). Therefore, the argument goes, it doesn&#8217;t matter about the quantities of these parent fats in the diet. What matters is the amount of long chain fats (in fish, etc.) </p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the rub and the lie to this argument. </p>
<p>According to the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey and other data, Americans consume more long chain omega-3 fatty acids than they do long chain omega-6 fatty acids (See &#8220;Polyunsaturated fatty acids in the food chain in the US&#8221;, Am J Clin Nutr 2000;71 S 179s-88s.) Yet their tissues are full of these highly inflammatory omega-6 fats. </p>
<p>How did this happen? There is only one way. The large amount of linoleic acid in the diet (about 7% of energy) overwhelms and outcompetes the much smaller amount of alpha linolenic acid (about .7% of energy). So it does matter how much linoleic acid we consume. Linoleic acid is the elephant in the living room and the reason we are experiencing the many chronic illnesses that are associated with an insufficiency of omega-3s.  </p>
<p><em>I like to think that anyone who has read <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/02/24/omega-3-greatest-hits/">my flaxseed oil results</a> (flaxseed is high in alpha linolenic acid, the short-chain omega-3 fat) would agree. Next question: My impression is that the optimal amount of omega-3 is highly unclear. Do you agree? </em></p>
<p>The optimal amount of omega-3s in one&#8217;s tissues does seem to vary, somewhat, according to where one lives. In the cold Artic, humans benefited from a very high proportion of omega-3s in their tissues, and there they weren&#8217;t penalized for having a lower proportion of omega-6s b/c there are few infectious microorganisms in the Artic. (Omega-6s, remember, are important in mounting a good immune response.) In more temperate and tropical regions, we need a more balanced amount of 3s and 6s in our tissues. We&#8217;ll be learning a lot more about these optimal amounts in the future. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s most critical to understand, though, is that omega-3s and omega-6s compete for enzymes and for positions in our cell membranes. So the amount of omega-3s you need to eat in order to achieve a given (optimal) amount in your tissues depends entirely on the amount of omega-6s you&#8217;re eating. If you&#8217;re eating small amounts of omega-6s, you need to eat only small amounts of fish and greens. If you&#8217;re eating, as most Americans are, large amount of omega-6s, you&#8217;ll need to eat large amounts of fish and greens &#8212; more fish than there are in the ocean!<br />
<em></p>
<p>Which widely-listened-to nutrition expert or group of experts has best appreciated the importance of omega-3s? Which has worst appreciated them?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had very good conversations with Dr. Mehmet Oz, and I know that Andrew Weil has a very good understanding of the issues. Epidemiologists seem to have the least appreciation because they have little knowledge and appreciation of biochemistry, in general.</p>
<p><em>In that last question I was thinking of Walter Willett, whose book Eat Drink and Be Healthy fails to clearly distinguish omega-3 and omega-6 fats. Since he&#8217;s an epidemiologist, that agrees with what you say. Can you say more about the reaction of epidemiologists?</em></p>
<p>For Willett to observe the difference between the two families of fats in his type of research, he would need subjects with very different proportions of these fats in their tissues. He doesn&#8217;t have that since all of his subjects eat a similar American diet. He also doesn&#8217;t see it because he doesn&#8217;t control for the two families and their competitive interactions. What we need to do to achieve a good understanding of the role of the two families of essential fats in health and disease is to take experimental work (which clearly shows important differences b/n the two families) and use it to frame our prospective studies. (And because of the competitive interactions, we can&#8217;t use fish intake as an indication of omega-3 status; we must use tissue levels of the two families!)</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119975627038373627.html?mod=hps_us_at_glance_pj">WSJ article</a> doesn&#8217;t reach much of an answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hardly a month goes by without a study suggesting that the omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil can fend off disease &#8212; including heart attacks, strokes, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, depression, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, psoriasis and even attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. </p>
<p>The problem is, to get the health benefits seen in clinical trials, you probably need to take fistfuls of capsules.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind of benefits seen in most of the clinical trials with omega-3 generally have involved much higher doses than you see recommended on supplement labels,&#8221; says Charles Serhan, a Harvard Medical School expert on omega-3&#8242;s activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which raises a little-discussed point. For practical purposes, it&#8217;s not enough to show that a drug works; you also need to find out the minimum dose that produces near-optimal results. In layman-speak, you need to find &#8220;the right dose.&#8221; Studies that compare drug and placebo are no help; much better would be studies that compare dosages (e.g., Group A gets one dose, Group B gets a different dose).</p>
<p>Here are three more useful comments:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">I found that about 3 Tablespoons/day</a> of flaxseed oil was enough to produce the best brain performance. As I&#8217;ve said, the amount that optimizes brain performance is likely to be a good amount for everything else. For the same reason that the best voltage pattern for your TV is likely to be a good voltage pattern for your other electrical appliances.</p>
<p>2. You can choose the minimum dose of fish oil that makes your gums perfectly pink. The transition from reddish gums (a sign of inflammation) to pink gums (no inflammation) takes about a week.</p>
<p>3. You can do mental tests to choose your dose, as I have done. The big problem here is practice effects &#8212; you will get better at the test just from doing it. So you will need several weeks of doing the test before the practice effects become small. You have to be a little bit sophisticated at data analysis &#8212; at least, able to plot your data &#8212; to take this approach.</p>
<p>In the future I can imagine people repeatedly measuring their mental ability with short (2-3 minute) tests, just as diabetics measure their blood sugar today.</p>

					<p>Yesterday I knocked something off a table and caught it before it fell very far. &#8220;Nice catch,&#8221; said an observer. I too was surprised. Today the same thing happened. Something fell and I surprised myself by catching it. I think it&#8217;s the omega-3. Tests showed that flaxseed oil reduces my &#8220;simple reaction time&#8221; &#8212; the time to push a button as quickly as possible in response to a signal.</p>

					<p>Tom <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/12//12/ulcerative-colitis-and-flaxseed-oil/#comment-88736">commented</a> on my <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/12/12/ulcerative-colitis-and-flaxseed-oil/">earlier post</a> on this topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>I imagine that the lady you met must have been newly diagnosed. I have had ulcerative colitis since 1996. Most of the people that I know with u.c. take omega-3, though perhaps more commonly as fish oil. All of my gastroenterologists have agreed that it can be a useful adjunct to other therapies. In fact, one of the drug companies is developing a supplement drink that combines omega-3â€™s with the soft fiber found in bananas, vitamin D and some other foods that are very beneficial to u.c., but hard to get in the right propotions. In general though, doctors seem reluctant to recommend diet-only solutions. I have a relatively mild case, but have had two bad flare ups. Consequently I take two of the drugs listed in addition to fish oil. I am hopeful that one day I will get off the other meds, but for now I just take a very low dose of the drugs thanks largely, based on my self-experimentation, to the omega-3s.</p></blockquote>
<p>The lady I met (who had ulcerative colitis) had had the problem for 14 years. She had not previously heard of using flaxseed oil. &#8220;This is your lucky day,&#8221; I told her, not because I told her to try flaxseed oil but because I could tell her a good dose (at least 2 T/day). <em>How much</em> is crucial information. </p>
<p>It is very difficult to do experiments, even self-experiments, that measure the effect of different doses of flaxseed oil on ulcerative colitis. I&#8217;m sure they haven&#8217;t been done. It was her lucky day because I&#8217;m pretty sure I was the only person in the world who could have told her with confidence what dose to take. (Which I could do because of the <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/12/13/my-omega-3-talk-at-psychonomics/">optimize brain &#8211;> optimize body principle</a>.) The gastroenterologists who recommend omega-3 as useful additions &#8212; they couldn&#8217;t say what the best dose is. The drug company making a supplement drink can&#8217;t say what the best dose is. </p>
<p>Until you know the best dose of a drug or nutrient &#8212; the one that delivers the largest possible effect &#8212; you are very likely to underestimate its effectiveness. If Tom starts using a large-enough dose of flaxseed oil he may no longer need other medications.</p>

					<p>The <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071126110453.htm">press release</a> had a curious title: &#8220;Omega-3 fatty acids protect against Parkinson&#8217;s.&#8221; The certainty suggested an experiment, but Parkinson&#8217;s is too rare to study prevention experimentally. The press release turned out to be about a rat study that used a drug called MDPT to cause brain damage that resembles Parkinson&#8217;s. Rats given a high-omega-3 diet suffered much less damage &#8212; apparently none &#8212; from the drug. </p>
<p>Rats given the high omega-3 diet had much less omega-6 in their brains than control rats &#8212; one more reason, in addition to the <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/02/02/the-israeli-paradox/">Israeli Paradox</a>, to think that omega-6 may be just as bad as omega-3 is good. Omega-3 may act by displacing omega-6 (they are almost identical physically). </p>
<p>The results could have been taken to suggest both (a) eat more omega-3-rich foods, such as fish and (b) eat less omega-6-rich foods, such as most nuts and vegetable oils, but only the first recommendation <a href="http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=5185659f-cde5-48b0-85e4-95d6fa641f32&#038;k=19940">reached the public</a>.</p>

				<small>Thursday, December 13th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>At the November meeting of the Psychonomic Society, a group of experimental psychologists, I gave a 15-minute talk (<a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/2007-11-16%20Rapid%20Effects%20of%20Omega-3%20Fats%20on%20Brain%20Function.ppt">PowerPoint</a>) about my omega-3 research. (Anyone know how to add audio to a PowerPoint file?) Almost all the data in the talk I&#8217;ve posted here, but it had one not-blogged idea, which I summarize like this: </p>
<p>optimize brain &#8211;> optimize body</p>
<p>The intake level of a nutrient that optimizes brain function should be close to the level that optimizes the function of everything else. In particular, the omega-3 intake that makes the brain work best should be close to the level that makes the rest of the body work best. This is because the brain and the rest of the body are bathed in the same blood. </p>
<p>It is easy to see why this is so. I have many electrical appliances: clock, telephone, TV, microwave, refrigerator, laser printer. In spite of vastly different innards and functions, all of them run best when their electrical supply is very close to house current. The electric current that makes my laser printer work best is very close to the electric current that makes my refrigerator work best. Of course, this is by design. LIkewise, the different parts of our body, although doing vastly different things, have all been adjusted by evolution to work best with the nutritional equivalent of house current. Just as we might study laser printers to learn what current to use with our refrigerator, we can study the brain to learn what nutrients optimize immune function.</p>
<p>This is a new idea in nutrition (at least, new to me). It is supported by and explains some of the most interesting data I&#8217;ve posted. It explains why Tyler Cowen&#8217;s gums got <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-surgery-commuted/">so much better so quickly</a> &#8212; because he was taking almost exactly the best amount of flaxseed oil for his gums. Tyler chose his intake of flaxseed oil based on my behavioral data, which suggested the best amount was between 2 and 3 tablespoons/day. The gums and the brain could hardly be more different, but the best level for the brain turned out to do a wonderful job of healing his gums. Same thing with <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/">Anonymous and sports injuries</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, this shows the scientific value of blogging. My gums got better, too, but not as impressively as Tyler&#8217;s. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of injuries to heal. The big improvements noticed by Tyler and Anonymous were &#8220;accidents&#8221; (unintended consequences). Science thrives on accidents; blogging, it turns out, is a new way to generate them.</p>

					<p>Ulcerative colitis is a disease of too much inflammation. The Mayo Clinic <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ulcerative-colitis/DS00598/DSECTION=8">recommends</a> several dangerous and expensive anti-inflammatory drugs. Based on <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-even-more/">its effect on inflamed gums</a> (gingivitis), I suspect flaxseed oil would be very effective, much safer, more convenient, and much cheaper, assuming you get the right dose (about 2 tablespoons/day). </p>
<p>Flaxseed oil is not on the Mayo Clinic list. Nor is any other source of omega-3. In a store today I ran into a woman seeking herbal treatments for ulcerative colitis. She hadn&#8217;t heard of using flaxseed oil.</p>
<p>Does anyone reading this have direct experience about what happens when you take flaxseed oil for ulcerative colitis?</p>
<p>The Mayo Clinic website <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gingivitis/DS00363/DSECTION=3">doesn&#8217;t say anything </a>about using flaxseed oil (or other omega-3 sources) to treat gingivitis. (And the Mayo Clinic <a href="http://bookstore.mayoclinic.com/products/bookDetails.cfm?mpid=35&#038;trkid=20477S13939270">claims expertise</a> on alternative medicine.) Nor does it say gingivitis is caused by too much inflammation. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/16/omega-3-what-happens-when-you-stop/">In two weeks</a>, you can see for yourself they are wrong. </p>

				<small>Monday, December 10th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>From the <a href="http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/160/5/996">abstract</a> of a 2003 article titled &#8220;A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Omega-3 Fatty Acid Docosahexaenoic Acid in the Treatment of Major Depression&#8221;: </p>
<blockquote><p>Thirty-six depressed patients were randomly assigned to receive DHA, 2 g/day, or placebo for 6 weeks. Response was defined a priori as a >=50% reduction in the score on the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale. Thirty-five participants were evaluable; 18 received DHA, and 17 received placebo. RESULTS: Response rates were 27.8% in the DHA group and 23.5% in the placebo group. The difference in response rates between groups did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: This trial failed to show a significant effect of DHA monotherapy in subjects with major depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>This study is unusual in that it used DHA rather than EPA. EPA studies have been more successful. Excerpt from an <a href="http://dtb.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/45/2/9">overview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One meta-analysis combined all the studies involving adults with unipolar or bipolar depression reported above, in which omega-3 fatty acids were used to augment existing treatments or as monotherapy. Best-case and worst-case analyses were carried out, and omega-3 fatty acids were found to produce a statistical improvement compared to placebo under both scenarios (best-case p = 0.02, worst-case p = 0.03). A second review including the same data has also suggested a benefit of omega-3 fatty acids in major depression. However, as the authors of both reviews point out, there is significant heterogeneity among the included trials, and this undermines the reliability of the combined results.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the conclusion from another <a href="http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/6/1308">review article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trial evidence that examines the effects of nâ€“3 PUFAs on depressed mood is limited and is difficult to summarize and evaluate because of considerable heterogeneity. The evidence available provides little support for the use of nâ€“3 PUFAs to improve depressed mood.</p></blockquote>
<p>A weak effect, in other words. I would be surprised if omega-3s helped a lot with depression. My <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/117/">self-experimentation</a> pointed to a different cause of depression â€” seeing faces too little in the morning and/or too much at night.</p>

					<p>David Marcus made the following <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/02/what-causes-heart-attacks/">comment</a> on an <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/02/what-causes-heart-attacks/">earlier post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Itâ€™s a myth that Eskimos have low rates of heart disease. Actually, recent studies have shown they have high rates of cardiovascular disease (50% higher than western populations) despite diets that are very high in fatty fish.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Marcus makes a very good point (and it is wonderful to get such informative feedback). <em>Myth</em> is wrong. A Greenland doctor&#8217;s casual observation &#8212; Eskimos almost never died of heart attacks &#8212; was confirmed by a detailed study, published in <em>Acta Medica Scandinavica</em> in 1980. A r<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&#038;Cmd=ShowDetailView&#038;TermToSearch=16277122&#038;ordinalpos=8&#038;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum">ecent study</a>, however, found this:</p>
<blockquote><p>OBJECTIVES: The thirty-year-old hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acid (FA) may &#8220;reduce the development of thrombosis and atherosclerosis in the Western World&#8221; still needs to be tested. Dyerberg-Bang based their supposition on casual observations that coronary atherosclerosis in Greenlandic Inuit was &#8216;almost unknown&#8217; and that they consumed large amounts of omega-3 FAs. However, no association was demonstrated with data. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: 454 Alaskan Eskimos were screened for coronary heart disease (CHD), using a protocol that included ECG, medical history, Rose questionnaire, blood chemistries, including plasma FA concentrations, and a 24-hour recall and a food frequency questionnaire assessment of omega-3 FA consumption. RESULTS: CHD was found in 6% of the cohort under 55 years of age and in 26% of those > or = 55 years of age. Eskimos with CHD consume as much omega-3 FAs as those without CHD, and the plasma concentrations confirm that dietary assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Average daily consumption of omega-3 FAs among Eskimos was high, with about 3-4 g/d reported, compared with 1-2 g/d used in intervention studies and the average consumption of 0.2 g/d by the American population. There was no association between current omega-3 FA consumption/blood concentrations and the presence of CHD.</p></blockquote>
<p>A well-written abstract, by the way.</p>
<p>Science is like a game of telephone. It would be truly weird if the initial observation was wrong, given that it was later confirmed in detail and productively followed up &#8212; and no one doubts that omega-3 increases clotting time. But &#8220;replications&#8221; are never exact. This study, for example, measured &#8220;in vivo&#8221; CHD, whereas the initial observation was about causes of death. The group of Eskimos studied is probably different; and their lifestyle, especially their diet, may have changed substantially in the last 30 years. On the other hand, these new observations are consistent with the great difficulty there has been in confirming the idea that omega-3 fats reduce heart disease.</p>

					<p>Dr. Jorn Dyerberg was one of two Danish doctors who discovered that Eskimos in Greenland, with low rates of heart disease, have much more omega-3 in their blood than Danes in Greenland, with normal rates of heart disease. This was the beginning of the great interest in omega-3s. <a href="http://www.nutraingredients.com/news/ng.asp?n=81606">Here</a> is an interview with Dr. Dyberg. Among his comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for ALA, an omega-3 from plants that is converted in the body to EPA and subsequently DHA, he was unconvinced. In terms of biological effects of DHA and EPA, Dr. Dyerberg said there are many. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know of any specific biological effects of ALA,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tissue experiments give you an ALA concentration of zero. This omega-3 is either burnt or converted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the conversion is low.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we want the benefits of omega-3, we have to eat them as long chain,&#8221; he said, referring to EPA and DHA.</p></blockquote>

					<p>I was surprised to see a chapter in <em>Fish, Omega-3 and Human Health</em> devoted to hypertension. Isn&#8217;t high blood pressure caused by too much salt and too much weight? Well, yes, but a special strain of rats used as an animal model of hypertension turned out to have a defect in their immune system. Perhaps high blood pressure is also caused by immune-system over-reaction.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&#038;Cmd=ShowDetailView&#038;TermToSearch=8141868&#038;ordinalpos=1&#038;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus">1993 meta-analysis </a>of studies of the effect of fish oil on blood pressure concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Diet supplementation with a relatively high dose of omega-3 PUFA, generally more than 3 g/d, can lead to clinically relevant BP reductions in individuals with untreated hypertension.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sizes of the blood pressure changes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Weighted, pooled estimates of SBP [systolic blood pressure] and DBP [diastolic blood pressure] change (mm Hg) with 95% confidence intervals were -1.0 (-2.0 to 0.0) and -0.5 (-1.2 to +0.2) in the trials of normotensives, and -5.5 (-8.1 to -2.9) and -3.5 (-5.0 to -2.1) in the trials of untreated hypertensives.</p></blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&#038;Cmd=ShowDetailView&#038;TermToSearch=8339414&#038;ordinalpos=1&#038;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus">different meta-analysis </a>reached essentially the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Note the use of fish oil. Fish oil has long-chain omega-3 fats, while flaxseed oil &#8212; which I have used in my self-experimentation &#8212; has only the short-chain omega-3 fat, which is converted to long-chain omega-3 after you eat it. Fish oil is often considered better because the omega-3s don&#8217;t need to be converted. But this way of thinking misses something. Because the omega-3s in flaxseed oil are converted to long-chain omega-3s by enzymes, the amount of long-chain omega-3 in the body rises more slowly (and thus lasts longer) than if you take fish oil supplying the same amount of long-chain omega-3. Flaxseed oil supplies a kind of time-release long-chain omega-3. A long low dose <a href="http://heartscanblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/omega-3-fatty-acids-frequency-vs.html">could easily be more potent</a> than a short high dose.</p>

<p>Very persuasive to me, too, regardless of what it is called.</p>

					<p>I ordered <em><a href="https://www.aocs.org/catalog/product.asp?ID=w204&#038;dept=10">Fish, Omega-3 and Human Health</a></em> (2005, 2nd ed.) by William Lands from Amazon in March. It came a few days ago. It is published by the <a href="https://www.aocs.org/press/">AOCS Press</a>. AOCS = American Oil Chemists&#8217; Society.</p>
<p>A jewel of a book. Like a research monograph, it has lots of data, graphs, and references; unlike a research monograph, it tries to reach any scientifically literate reader, not just specialists. It has much more about mechanism than other books on the subject. &#8220;Health&#8221; in the title mainly means circulatory system health (heart disease, strokes); there is also a chapter on the immune system and a chapter on cancer. Almost nothing about mental illness or the brain. Nothing about gum disease. </p>
<p>I read the first edition a year ago. It is a sign of changes in my thinking that I didn&#8217;t notice a comparison of epilepsy rates in Eskimos (high omega-3 diet) and Danes (low omega-3 diet) living in Greenland. The Eskimos have twice as much epilepsy. It is the only big negative effect of the Eskimo diet. The epilepsy difference fits something I think now but didn&#8217;t think a year ago: omega-3 makes neurons more easily excited. Three observations led me to this: (a) In my choice reaction-time experiments, flaxseed oil caused an increase in anticipation errors. To reduce them, I changed from a two-choice task to a four-choice task. (b) A friend said I have become more talkative, apparently due to consuming much more flaxseed oil/day. (c) I found that <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/25/science-in-action-omega-3-simple-reaction-time/">flaxseed oil reduces simple RT</a> &#8212; latency to press a button when something happens.</p>
<p>The two-to-one epilepsy ratio is the only case where the Eskimos are clearly worse off. The ratios in the other direction are much larger. The Danes had 20 times more psoriasis than the Eskimos (as I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/02/10/omega-3-facts-of-the-day/">noted earlier</a>), and 25 times more bronchial asthma. </p>

Another, first noticed by her dentist (&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say anything&#8221;), is that her gums were in better shape. The third, more subtle than the first two, is more energy.

					<p><a style="border-bottom-style: groove;" href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/">Tucker Max</a> wrote again, with new data:</p>
<blockquote><p>I started taking two tablespoons of flax seed oil about a month after reading <a style="border-bottom-style: groove;" href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-surgery-commuted/">this post</a> by you [about Tyler Cowen's dental experience] (sometime around the beginning of August, I think). I decided to try it because I have had bleeding gums for about as long as I can remember. This has always confused me, because I don&#8217;t have any cavities and have otherwise good dental health. I would always ask my dentists about this, and they would always tell me I didn&#8217;t floss enough, but even when I would floss regularly, the bleeding wouldn&#8217;t totally stop. After about a week or so of two tablespoons of flax seed oil a day, I had virtually no gum bleeding. I didn&#8217;t change anything else.</p>
<p>Then, about two weeks ago, my girlfriend pointed something out to me: I was not taking pain relievers anymore. I train in amateur mixed martial arts (MMA), which is a very intense, full contact combat sport that combines boxing, muay thai, brazilian jiu-jitsu, and wrestling. For as long as I&#8217;ve been training in it, I have had to deal with muscle soreness and pain in my joints, and to deal with it, I would take 4-6 ibuprofen before training. But, for about the past three months, I wasn&#8217;t in enough pain to need it. I didn&#8217;t really think about it at first, just chalking it up to getting tougher. But that doesn&#8217;t make sense&#8211;I&#8217;ve been training in MMA for well over a year, and the only thing I have done differently in the past three months is start taking flax seed oil. I wasn&#8217;t 100% sure that the flax seed oil was making the difference, but considering the effect it has on inflammation&#8211;which is what ibuprofen is for&#8211;it made sense.</p>
<p>That was when I sent you the emails you <a style="border-bottom-style: groove;" href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/">posted</a>. One of your commenters <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/#comment-60468">accused me of falling victim to the placebo effect</a>, so I decided to test it. I stopped taking flaxseed oil on November 5th. At the time, my gums were not bleeding, I had no joint pain or soreness of any significance, and I felt great overall.</p>
<p>As I write this it&#8217;s November 15th. My gums have bled heavily when I brushed this week, especially the past few days, and I have intense pain in both shoulders, soreness in my left elbow, and my knees are throbbing. I had intended to go two weeks without taking any flaxseed oil, but I am stopping the experiment now because this is all the proof I need.</p>
<p>One more interesting fact: I took four tablespoons a few hours ago, instead of the regular two, thinking that maybe I could load up and it might help me get back to normal quickly. The pain is pretty much the same, and I just brushed and my gums bled, so obviously the flaxseed oil takes more than a few hours to affect those problems. But&#8211;and I haven&#8217;t measured this with reaction tests like you do&#8211;I feel considerably more mentally alert right now. I don&#8217;t know if I felt like this before, and maybe I didn&#8217;t notice it because it came on slowly, or maybe I need four tablespoons at once to see a difference, but I really do feel the difference.</p></blockquote>

					<p>Peter Spero has sent me the following abstract from a <a href="http://iospress.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&#038;backto=issue,7,12;journal,32,55;linkingpublicationresults,1:105656,1">paper</a> published in 2003 in the <em>Journal of Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been suggested that the dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could be inversely related to the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. This analysis examined the association between plasma concentration of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia. Data are reported on subjects 65 years or older who had a complete clinical evaluation at the first two waves (1991-1992 and 1996-1997) of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging. Main outcome measures were cognitive impairment and dementia by mean relative plasma concentrations of fatty acids in the phospholipid fraction at baseline. Results were adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, history of cardiovascular disease, and apolipoprotein E e4 genotype. In the cross-sectional analysis, no significant difference in omega-3<br />
polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations was observed between controls and both prevalent cases of cognitive impairment and dementia. In the prospective analysis, a higher eicosapentaenoic acid (p < 0.01) concentration was found in cognitively impaired cases compared to controls while higher docosahexaenoic acid (p < 0.07), omega-3 (p < 0.04) and total polyunsaturated fatty acid (p < 0.03) concentrations were found in dementia cases. These findings do not support the hypothesis that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids play a protective role in cognitive function and dementia.</p></blockquote>
<p>The people with worse-functioning brains had <em>more</em> omega-3 in their blood than everyone else. Which is opposite to one of the two studies I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/11/omega-3-and-cognitive-function-in-the-elderly/">described yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to have seen what reviewers made of this.</p>

					<p>Two papers in the <a href="http://www.ajcn.org/current.shtml">latest issue</a> of the <em><a href="http://www.ajcn.org/">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</a></em> provide more support for the idea that omega-3s improve brain function. </p>
<p>The first was a cross-sectional study involving about 2000 persons 70-74 years old in Norway. Their fish consumption was measured and they took a battery of cognitive tests. The more fish you ate, the better your score on every test, even after adjustment for several things.</p>
<p>The second used data collected as part of a 3-year experiment about something else (the effect of folic acid) with 800 persons aged 50-70. They measured the omega-3 concentrations in the blood of their subjects. Would these predict anything? Their results were more ambiguous:</p>
<blockquote><p>Higher plasma nâ€“3 PUFA proportions predicted less decline in sensorimotor speed . . . and complex speed . . . over 3 y. Plasma nâ€“3 PUFA proportions did not predict 3-y changes in memory, information-processing speed, or word fluency. The cross-sectional analyses showed no association between plasma nâ€“3 PUFA proportions and performance in any of the 5 cognitive domains.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cross-sectional correlations between a measure of omega-3 (fish consumption) and cognitive performance are exactly what the first study <em>did</em> find. </p>

					<p>The November 2007 issue of <a href="http://www.acresusa.com/magazines/magazine.htm">Acres USA</a>, a magazine about organic/sustainable farming, has an article (not online) about using omega-3s to cure farm-animal problems. Here are the best parts:</p>
<blockquote><p>One family reported that their dog had failed obedience training three times. Our therapy of cod liver oil (Nordic Naturals), Fasttrack probiotic, and a homeopathic prescription enabled him to pass on the next attempt. . . . Dogs experience panic attacks for a variety of reasons. One frantic German shepard dog jumped through a plate glass window to escape the house and get near his owner. The solution to his panic and anxiety attacks proved to be cod liver oil, the correct homeopathic medicine, and a whole-food diet rich in omega-3 oils and quality live probiotics.</p></blockquote>
<p>The obedience-training story resembles my story of taking flaxseed oil capsules and the next morning being able to easily put on my shoes standing up. With the difference that I&#8217;d had trouble several hundred times in a row, not just three.</p>
