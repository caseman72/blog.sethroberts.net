					<p>A reader writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m now 30 years old. For the past ten years or so, I&#8217;ve had constant post-nasal drip and stuffed sinuses, frequently coughing out phlegm. In addition, I&#8217;ve had fairly intense fatigue, moderate but consistent depression, and occasional but intense tendinitis (from typing). I tried nasal pharma sprays and many alternative therapies, feeling most intellectually compelled by neti pot style nasal washes with solutions that mimic salt balances of the body. However, none of my efforts did much good.  So I reluctantly agreed to have sinus surgery, even though it seemed to be a blunt force approach to a sensitive tissue.  I have since become convinced that treating the sinuses as anything other than an expression of overall health is preposterous. The surgery, with full anesthesia, improved things very slightly while being somewhat traumatic and certainly not worth the ordeal.</p>
<p>About 5 years ago, when I was 25, I discovered that I have a very under-active thyroid. Taking thyroid replacement was the biggest health change I&#8217;ve had in the past ten years, giving me much more energy, improving my overall health, and significantly reducing (but not eliminating) my sinus condition.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t start reading your blog regularly until a few months ago. Your writing on bacteria and flax oils led me to start taking probiotic pills every day (Trader Joes brand and then kyodophilus), eat more yogurt and kimchee, and take flax seed oil pills and try to incorporate flax oil into foods.  Within a month of starting this, my sinus congestion was reduced by about 90%.  I don&#8217;t need to constantly have tissues on hand and I can breathe easier every day. Thank you! I&#8217;m hoping to finally start making my own kombucha this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect it was the bacteria rather than the flaxseed oil that helped his nose. Like him, I used to need to carry a handkerchief at all times and I went through a whole box of Kleenex in a few months. This didn&#8217;t stop when I started drinking lots of flaxseed oil. After I started drinking lots of fermented foods, however, my nose became a lot clearer and my Kleenex consumption went way down.</p>

					<p>Roberto Medri, a 27-year-old who works in Italy for <a href="http://www.bain.com/bainweb/home.asp">Bain &#038; Company</a>, a consulting firm, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have had bad shaving problems since I started working three years ago. I tried pretty much everything: multiple blades, old-time safety razors, expensive British shaving soaps, silvertip brushes, pre-shaving oil and creams, abstruse shaving methods and blade techniques: all to almost no avail. Instead, my face would bleed more and more every day, making it frustrating and time-expensive to shave, only to get results which ranged from laughable to frightening.</p>
<div>I noticed two patterns:</div>
<ul>
<li>Once in a couple of months, I used to have a perfect shave: fast, enjoyable, baby-butt smooth with no irritation. I was not, however, capable of isolating the deciding variable, as those epiphanies seemed to be completely random.</li>
<li>When I took up a new remedy (another pre-shave cream, steamed towels, etc.) things got better for 2-3 shaves, then back to normal horror.</li>
</ul>
<div>A fortnight ago, I began having perfect shaves. Consistently. I am simplifying my routine because all toners and moisturizers now seem useless. My towels are not stained, I am on time, I actually look forward to shaving every morning (with but only a slight fear of it all ending).</div>
<p>The only explanation I can think of is that, following your advice, I started taking four softgels/day of flax oil about a month ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very difficult to get flaxseed oil in Europe (bottled oil simply is not available). I have recommended flax to my colleagues also plagued by red necks to no avail: they are elite in two ways, white collar elite (working for Bain) and dietary elite (as Italians, which supposedly have the best and healthiest food ever), so it fits with your reasoning that they are <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/05/29/the-american-health-paradox-what-causes-it/">very change-averse</a>. In fact, a manager told me that my taking softgels during the day is &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; and &#8220;disturbing&#8221; colleagues.</p></blockquote>

				<small>Saturday, June 6th, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here is <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/06/04/canker-sores-and-omega-3/#comment-311583">a comment</a> left on <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/06/04/canker-sores-and-omega-3/">my earlier canker-sore post</a> by a reader named Ted:</p>
<blockquote><p>I found out quite by accident WALNUTS get rid of [canker sores] quite quickly. The first sign of an ulcer I chew walnuts and leave the paste in my mouth for a little while (30 seconds or so).</p>
<p>The first time was by accident, my ulcers disappeared so quickly I knew it had to be something I ate. And the only thing I had eaten differently the past day was walnuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flaxseed oil and walnuts differ in lots of ways but both are high in omega-3. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/16/omega-3-and-dental-health-still-more/">My gums got much better</a> around the time I started taking flaxseed oil. I neither noticed nor expected this; my dentist pointed it out. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/16/omega-3-and-dental-health-still-more/">Several others</a> have told me the same thing. Tyler Cowen&#8217;s gums <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/07/todays-happines.html">got dramatically better</a>. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/25/omega-3-and-sports-injuries-more/">One reader started and stopped and restarted flaxseed oil</a>, making it blindingly clear that the gum improvement is caused by flaxseed oil. There is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis">plenty of reason</a> to think the human diet was once much higher in omega-3. All this together convinces me that omega-3 can both prevent and cure canker sores. Not only that, I&#8217;m also convinced that canker sores are a sign of omega-3 deficiency. You shouldn&#8217;t just get rid of them with walnuts; you should change your diet. Omega-3 has other benefits (better brain function, less inflammation, probably others).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m right about this &#8212; canker sores really are prevented and cured by omega-3. Then there are several things to notice.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Web facilitation</strong>. It was made possible by the internet. My initial interest in flaxseed oil came from reading the <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/">Shangri-La Diet forums</a>. I didn&#8217;t have to read a single book about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis">Aquatic Ape theory</a>; I could learn enough online. Tyler Cowen&#8217;s experience was in his blog. Eric Vlemmix contacted me by email. No special website was involved.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Value of self-experimentation</strong>. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">My flaxseed oil self-experimentation</a> played a big part, although it had nothing to do with mouth health. These experiments showed dramatic benefits &#8212; so large and fast that something in flaxseed oil, presumably omega-3, had to be a necessary nutrient. Because of these results, I blogged about omega-3 a lot, which is why Eric emailed me about his experience.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Unconventional evidence</strong>. All the evidence here, not just the self-experimentation, is what advocates of <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/312/7023/71">evidence-based medicine</a> and other <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/08/something-is-better-than-nothing-part-2/">evidence snobs</a> criticize. Much of it is anecdotal. Yet the evidence snobs have, in this case, nothing to show for their snobbery. They <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9421219?ordinalpos=1&#038;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&#038;linkpos=1&#038;log$=relatedreviews&#038;logdbfrom=pubmed">missed this conclusion completely</a>. Nor do you need a double-blind study to verify/test this conclusion. If you have canker sores, you simply drink flaxseed oil or eat walnuts and see if they go away. Maybe this <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/200025">omnipresent</a> evidence snobbery is . . . completely wrong? Maybe this has something to do with the <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/06/05/what-does-profound-stagnation-look-like/">stagnation in health research</a>?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Lack of credentials</strong>. No one involved with this conclusion is a nutrition professor or dentist or medical doctor, as far as I know. Apparently you don&#8217;t need proper credentials to figure out important things about health. Of course, we&#8217;ve been here before: Jane Jacobs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Morgan_(writer)">Elaine Morgan</a>.</p>
<p>5.<strong> Failure of &#8220;trusted&#8221; health websites</strong>. Health websites you might think you could trust missed this completely. The <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/canker-sore/DS00354/DSECTION=causes">Mayo Clinic website</a> lists 15 possible causes &#8212; none of them involving omega-3. (Some of them, we can now see, are correlates of canker sores, also caused by lack of omega-3.) If canker sores can be cured with walnuts, the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/canker-sore/DS00354/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs">Mayo list of treatments</a> reads like a list of scurvy cures from the Middle Ages. The <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/update0205b.shtml">Harvard Medical School health website</a> is even worse. &#8220;Keep in mind that       up to half of all adults have experienced canker sores at least once,&#8221; it says. This is supposed to <strong>reassure </strong>you. Surely something this common couldn&#8217;t be a serious problem.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Failure of the healthcare establishment</strong>. Even worse, the entire healthcare establishment, with its vast resources, hasn&#8217;t managed to figure this out. Canker sores are not considered a major health problem, no, but, if I&#8217;m right, that too is a mistake. They are certainly common. If they indicate an important nutritional deficiency (too little omega-3), they become very important and their high prevalence <strong>is </strong>a major health problem.</p>

					<p>Eric Vlemmix writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve had these oral sores [canker sores, also called Aphthous ulcers] since childhood [he's 33], but since taking flax/fish oil I have had hardly any ulcers! The times I had an ulcer it was small, less painful than usual, and would disappear in a few days. The doctors never knew what the cause of these ulcers was, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_ulcer">Wikipedia states</a>: cause unknown.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked about his fish oil and flaxseed oil intake:</p>
<blockquote><p>Something like 15 ml [= 1 tablespoon] of flaxseed oil daily. Most days I also take a Minami morEPA plus capsule which has 635 mg EPA, and 195 mg DHA.</p>
<p>I started SLD in June 2008, and I think I switched from olive oil to flax the same month. Since then I haven&#8217;t had a real serious case of ulcers. Some small issues sometimes, but not the real big and extremely painful ones that I had before. Sometimes a small mini zit-like thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/articles/613.html">Family Doctor</a>, &#8220;Doctors don&#8217;t know of anything that prevents canker sores from forming.&#8221; The <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/canker-sore/DS00354">Mayo Clinic website</a> is equally unhelpful. To prevent canker sores, <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/canker_sores/page4_em.htm#Prevention">EMedicineHealth</a> advises, &#8220;Do not talk while chewing.&#8221; According to <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/aches/canker.html">KidsHealth</a>, &#8220;About 1 in 5 people regularly gets bothersome canker sores.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any canker-sore sufferer want to start taking flaxseed oil and fish oil (in the amounts Eric uses) and tell me what happens?</p>

				<small>Saturday, May 2nd, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>During my last dental exam, a month ago, I was told my gums were in excellent shape. Clearly better than my previous visit. The obvious difference between the two visits is that I now eat lots of fermented food. At the previous visit, my gums were in better shape than a few years ago. They suddenly improved when I started drinking a few tablespoons of flaxseed oil every day. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-surgery-commuted/">Tyler Cowen</a> is the poster child for that effect. After a lifetime of being told to brush and floss more &#8212; which I did, and which helped a little but not a lot &#8212; it now turns out, at least for me, that the secret of healthy gums is: 1. Eat fermented foods. 2. Consume omega-3. These two guidelines are not only a lot easier than frequent brushing and flossing but have a lot of other benefits, unlike brushing and flossing.</p>
<p>Dentistry is ancient and there are millions of dentists, but apparently the profession has never figured this out. This isn&#8217;t surprising &#8212; how <em>could</em> they figure it out? &#8212; but it is an example of a general truth about how things get better. (Or why they don&#8217;t get better &#8212; if only dentists and dental-school professors are allowed to do dental research.) In <em>The Economy of Cities</em>, Jane Jacobs makes this point. For a long time, Jacobs says, farming was a low-yield profession. Then crop rotation schemes, tractors, cheap fertilizer, high-yield seeds, and dozens of other labor-saving yield-increasing inventions came along. <strong>Farmers didn&#8217;t invent tractors.</strong> They didn&#8217;t invent any of the improvements. They were busy farming. Just as dentists are busy doing dentistry and dental-school professors are busy studying conventional ways of improving gum health.</p>
<p>Jacobs also writes about the sterility of large organizations &#8212; their inability to come up with new goods and services. On the face of it, large organizations, such as large companies, are powerful. Yes, they can be efficient but they can&#8217;t be creative, due to what Jacobs calls &#8220;the infertility of captive divisions of labor.&#8221; In a large organization, you get paid for doing X. You can&#8217;t start doing X+Y, where Y is helpful to another part of the company, because you don&#8217;t get paid for doing Y. A nutrition professor might become aware of the anti-inflammatory effects of flaxseed oil but wouldn&#8217;t study its effects on gum health. That&#8217;s not what nutrition professors do. So neither dentists nor dental-school professors nor nutrition professors could discover the effects I discovered. They were trapped by organizational lines, by divisions of labor, that I was free of.</p>

					<p>From <a href="http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/news/20090324/fatty-fish-may-cut-prostate-cancer-risk">a new study</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Men who eat salmon and other fish high in omega-3 fatty acids on a regular basis have a decreased risk for developing advanced prostate cancer, new research suggests.</p>
<p>The association was most pronounced among men believed to have a genetic predisposition for developing aggressive prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Men in the study who ate one or more servings of fatty fish a week were found to have a 63% lower risk for developing aggressive prostate cancer than men who reported never eating fish, study co-researcher John S. Witte, PhD, tells WebMD.</p>
<p>The study is not the first to find that men who eat fatty fish have a lower risk for the most deadly forms of prostate cancer. But Witte says clinical trials are needed to show that eating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids actually lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Needed&#8221;? Or is this like a Grammy winner thanking God in his acceptance speech? That is, ritualistic. I prefer this way of making the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Roswell Park Cancer Institute President and professor of oncology Donald Trump, MD, tells WebMD that there is enough evidence suggesting a protective role for omega-3 against prostate cancer to justify a large trial studying whether eating a diet rich in omega-3s &#8212; or even taking omega-3 supplements &#8212; can actually lower risk of prostate cancer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someday an astute person will write a paper called &#8220;How accurate are clinical trials?&#8221;</p>
<p>The protective power of fish oil is supported by the very low rate of prostate cancer in Japan &#8212; 15 times lower than in America, according to <a href="http://www.jafra.gr.jp/eng/sumi.html">this</a>.</p>

				<small>Thursday, March 26th, 2009</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In the early 1900s, the anthropologist/explorer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilhjalmur_Stefansson">Vilhjalmur Stefansson</a>, after living with Eskimos for a long time, returned to tell Americans what he had learned about nutrition. Eskimos ate meat almost exclusively, he said, which contradicted the usual emphasis, then as now, on diversity and fruits and vegetables. Yet Eskimos were healthy. Eskimo diet became even more fascinating when it was realized they had very low rates of heart disease &#8212; much lower than Danes, for example. In the 1970s, two Danish doctors, Bang and Dyerberg, found that Eskimos had large amounts of omega-3 fats in their blood, much more than Danes; that was the beginning of the current interest in omega-3 and the idea that fish and fish oil are &#8220;heart-healthy&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I pointed out <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/01/26/the-inuit-paradox/">earlier</a>, discussions of the Eskimo diet have ignored the fermented food they ate. Here&#8217;s what Stefansson said <a href="http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson1.htm">in 1935</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I like fermented (therefore slightly acid) whale oil with my fish as well as ever I liked mixed vinegar and olive oil with a salad. . . .</p>
<p>There were several grades of decayed fish. The August catch had been protected by longs from animals but not from heat and was outright rotten. The September catch was mildly decayed. The October and later catches had been frozen immediately and were fresh. There was less of the August fish than of any other and, for that reason among the rest, it was a delicacy &#8211; eaten sometimes as a snack between meals, sometimes as a kind of dessert and always frozen, raw. . . .</p>
<p>[At first, Stefansson didn't want to eat decayed fish.] While it is good form [in America] to eat decayed milk products and decayed game [well, well], it is very bad form to eat decayed fish. . . . If it is almost a mark of social distinction to be able to eat strong cheeses with a straight face and smelly birds with relish, why is it necessarily a low taste to be fond of decaying fish? On that basis of philosophy, though with several qualms, I tried the rotten fish one day, and if memory serves, liked it better than my first taste of Camembert. During the next weeks I became fond of rotten fish.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Eskimos ate fermented whale oil and a lot of rotten fish. (&#8220;A lot&#8221; because if they didn&#8217;t eat a lot of it, Steffanson wouldn&#8217;t have felt pressure to eat it.) I had no idea that Americans used to eat decayed game.</p>

<p>As I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/03/07/hey-what-happened-to-my-brain-part-1/">blogged earlier</a>, my arithmetic performance suddenly improved about a month ago (close-up above). How fast the change: On February 2 at 8 am I took the test; my scores were roughly the same as they had been the past month. At 2 pm the same day, I took the test again and was about 50 msec faster. (In reaction-time experiments, a surprising 50-msec effect is huge.) I remained faster for at least several weeks. Comparing the last 30 sessions before the shift to the first 30 sessions after the shift, <em>t</em> (38) = 11, <em>p</em> = extremely small. In an experiment, comparing treatment and baseline, <em>t></em> 3 is very good and <em>t </em>> 4 is extremely good.</p>
<p>What might have caused this?</p>
<p>I moved to Beijing in October. Eventually I ran out of the <a href="http://www.spectrumorganics.com/?id=59">Spectrum Organic flaxseed oil</a> I&#8217;d brought with me and started drinking a Beijing brand called <a href="http://www.joyfulorganic.com/E-Organic-Flaxseed-Oil.htm">Joyful Organic</a>. When I returned to Berkeley I brought a few bottles of it with me and continued to drink it. In late January I ran out; the evening of January 29 I started drinking Spectrum Organic again. Four days later my arithmetic scores sharply improved.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really plausible that the improvement was due to the change in flaxseed oils. Flaxseed oil had made a difference (versus nothing) <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/21/science-in-action-omega-3-flaxseed-oil-vs-nothing-2/">with a very similar task</a>. A few weeks before the shift, a friend had asked how I knew if my Chinese flaxseed oil was good; I&#8217;d said I&#8217;d find out when I switched back to Spectrum Organic.</p>
<p>But why was the improvement delayed four days? I started studying flaxseed oil because one evening I took several capsules and the next morning noticed my balance was better. And if the improvement is going to take that long, why would it happen so sharply after the delay? I can&#8217;t even begin to answer these questions.</p>

					<blockquote><p>The Budwig protocol is the food treatment and cure for cancer and other major debilitating diseases created by Dr. Johanna Budwig. It was designed for use with extremely ill and wasted cancer patients who had been sent home by their doctors to die. These were patients so ill that many were unable to take any food at all in the beginning, and had to be initially treated with enemas. The protocol is so simple that it can be tailored to fit whatever situation is encountered, from use with someone at death&#8217;s door to use as a preventative and part of a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>There are only two essential foods in the protocol, flax oil and cottage cheese or some other sulphurated protein such as yogurt or kefir. The oil provides electron-rich fats, and the cottage cheese provides the sulphurated protein to bind with the oil and render it water soluble. In this state, the oil is able to carry immense amounts of oxygen straight into the cells. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygen rich environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/024719.html">Natural News</a>. Yeah, the explanation (&#8220;electron-rich fats&#8221;) is absurd, but the general empirical idea (the use of flaxseed oil and cottage cheese to cure cancer) is of course very important. It isn&#8217;t complicated why flaxseed oil might be highly beneficial: Our diets used to provide much more omega-3 than they now do; flaxseed oil, high in omega-3, reduces the deficiency. The idea that cottage cheese makes flaxseed oil more digestible is also very interesting.</p>

					<p>From a <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-10/uom-pwc102708.php">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A study has found that the risks of a premature birth quadruple if flaxseed oil is consumed in the last two trimesters of pregnancy. The research was conducted by Professor Anick BÃ©rard of the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al&#8217;s Faculty of Pharmacy and the Sainte-Justine Hospital Research Center and Master&#8217;s student Krystel Moussally.</p>
<p>In Canada, 50 percent of pregnant women take prescription medication. Yet many of them prefer to use natural health products during the pregnancy. &#8220;We believe these products to be safe because they are natural. But in reality, they are chemical products and we don&#8217;t know many of the risks and benefits of these products contrarily to medication,&#8221; says BÃ©rard.</p>
<p>BÃ©rard and Moussally set out to conduct one of the largest studies ever undertaken on by analyzing data from 3354 Quebec women. The first part of the research established that close to 10 percent of women between 1998 and 2003 used natural health products during their pregnancy. Before and after pregnancy they were respectively 15 and 14 percent to use these products. The increase means that about a third of women consuming natural health products stopped during the pregnancy.</p>
<p>The most consumed natural health products by pregnant women are chamomile (19 percent), green tea (17 percent), peppered mint (12 percent), and flaxseed oil (12 percent). BÃ©rard and Moussally correlated these products to premature births and only one product had a very strong correlation: flaxseed oil.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the general population, the average rate of premature births is 2 to 3 percent. But for women consuming flaxseed oil in their last two trimesters that number jumps up to 12 percent,&#8221; says BÃ©rard. &#8220;It&#8217;s an enormous risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The correlation existed only with flaxseed oil, yet women consuming the actual seed were unaffected. Even if more studies must be undertaken to verify these results, BÃ©rard recommends caution when it comes to consuming flaxseed oil.</p></blockquote>

					<p>Susan Allport&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Queen-Fats-Omega-3s-Removed-California/dp/0520253809/ref=sethrobertand-20">The Queen of Fats</a> </em>is the best introduction to omega-3 fatty acids and their importance that I know of. I learned a lot from it (and <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/01/28/interview-with-susan-allport/">interviewed the author</a>). This is why its errors are interesting; they shed light on the big nutritional misconceptions of our time (as Weston Price, the subject of <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/07/20/nutrition-and-physical-degeneration/">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>, did in a different way). Joel Kauffman, a chemist, made a list:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. On p1 low-carb bread and beer are ridiculed despite evidence (see Nielsen JV, Joensson EA, Low-carbohydrate diet in type 2 diabetes. Stable improvement of body weight and glycaemic control during 22 months follow-up, Nutrition &#038; Metabolism 2006;3(22) doi:10.1186/1743-7075-3-22) to the contrary. There are at least 10 studies supporting Nielsen. Low-carb means low insulin demand. Insulin converts carb to fat. Allportâ€™s claim that the worldâ€™s leanest peoples mostly eat carbs neglects to mention that they are malnourished.</p>
<p>3. On p2 and later Allport calls saturated fatty acid chains â€œstraightâ€, then still later by the correct term â€œzigzagâ€, but never by the chemistâ€™s term â€œunbranchedâ€. She is not aware that a saturated fatty acid chain of 22 carbons has many more conformations than the 22-carbon DHA with 6 carbon-carbon double bonds, or that double bonds keep 4-carbon groups rigid. If DHA â€œis constantly on the moveâ€ there must be some other reason.</p>
<p>5. On p10 canola oil, which is not rapeseed oil, is not usually promoted for its linolenic acid content, but for its low saturated content, lower than olive oil. This is not a real advantage, according to all the books (except Searsâ€™) I have listed above.</p>
<p>6. The conundrum of eating fish for its omega-3s despite the mercury content was not resolved on p11 or elsewhere. There are two long-term studies showing that there is not a big problem: The Chicago Western Electric Study followed the effects of fish consumption in 2,107 men aged 40-55, and followed for 30 years. Those who ate an average of *35 g daily (about 1 big fish dinner every 5 days) had only 9/10 of the all-cause mortality rate of men who ate no fish. The Nursesâ€™ Health Study on 84,688 women aged 34-59 years and followed for 16 years for outcomes vs. fish and omega-3 fatty acid intake, had the following findings: women consuming fish five times weekly had only 7/10 the all-cause mortality rate of those eating fish once a month. Pregnant women have been cautioned to restrict their intake of fish (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbc.ca/storyview/CBC/2002/10/21/Consumers/mercuryfish_021021">http://www.cbc.ca/storyview/CBC/2002/10/21/Consumers/mercuryfish_021021</a>) despite evidence that children receive most of their mercury from vaccines. Hepatitis b vaccine carries 12.5 micrograms per dose; influenza and other common vaccines carry 25 micrograms per shot, over 830 times the amount in a can of tuna. It has been reported that vaccines said not to contain the mercury compound, thimerosal, still might have it. The long duration of the diet studies makes it very clear that the mercury content of fish, in general, is not shortening life.</p>
<p>7. On p14 eating fat in general was used as a straw man and implied to be the major cause of heart disease. Not so; see below (section titled <strong>More</strong> at bottom of post).</p>
<p>8. On p15 the Framingham Study was claimed to have shown a positive link between serum cholesterol and risk of heart disease. This was disproven by 1937 by experiments on cadavers. See The Cholesterol Myths and either Great Cholesterol Con [there are two books with this title]. See above for evidence that the Seven Countries Study was a fraud. A more recent study on free-living elderly in Manhattan showed the opposite â€” those with the highest cholesterol and LDL0C levels lived the longest. See Schupf N, Costa R, Luchsinger J, et al. (2005). Relationship Between Plasma Lipids and All-Cause Mortality in Nondemented Elderly. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 53:219-226.</p>
<p>10. On p20 the excessive bleeding in Eskimos is said to be unimportant vs. lower heart attack rates than those of Danes, but external bleeding, as with aspirin, probably indicates internal bleeding.</p>
<p>11. On p21 it was written that polyunsaturated fats held down cholesterol levels. Actually HDL levels were held down and there was no drop in mortality: Rose GA, Thomson WB, Williams RT (1965). Corn Oil in Treatment of Ischaemic Heart Disease. British Medical JournalÂ  12 Jun:1531-1533.</p>
<p>12. On p22 gas-liquid chromatography was said to have been developed in the 1950s by oil companies. A Google search showed its invention in the 1940s to separate fatty acids: see James A T &#038; Martin A J P. Gas-liquid partition chromatography: the separation and microestimation of volatile fatty acids from formic acid to dodecanoic acid. Biochem. J. 50:679-90, 1952. [National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, England]</p>
<p>13. On p22-3, 25 it is implied that the increase in heart disease in Eskimos who adopted aspects of a Western diet is solely due to differences in omega-x fat intake. No attention was paid to the effect of carbs on a very carb-sensitive population.</p>
<p>14. On p25 Allport insults Spam for being â€œhighly saturatedâ€. This is nonsense, since lard is only 40% saturated. See Know Your Fats by Mary G. Enig, 2000.</p>
<p>17. On p49 the â€œpure cholesterolâ€ fed to rabbits has been shown to be oxycholesterol, which is not healthful.</p>
<p>18. On p51 Ancel Keys, MD, was said to link serum cholesterol to heart disease, but this link had already been shown to be false in 1937 by work on cadavers.</p>
<p>19. On p54 Allport wrote that EPA was responsible for low cholesterol in Eskimo blood on traditional diets, but linoleic acid based fats do this also, and human fat is 10% linoleic (lard 6%).<br />
20. On p57 was written that pork and dairy fats are very saturated. Actually, the former is about 40% saturated and the latter 62%. See Know Your Fats.</p>
<p>31. On p66 a crack was made about an unbalanced diet. Since some populations have survived for centuries on all animal diets, a balanced diet turns out to be a fantasy designed to raise carb consumption despite a lack of evidence that there is any requirement for carb at all in the human diet. See the Ottoboniâ€™s book. Also, there is vitamin C in fresh meat, so worrying about scurvy was not justified.</p>
<p>32. On p68 the claim that fats and carbs make up over 80% of the calories in every diet consumed by humankind is absurd, based on traditional Eskimo and Masai diets, among others.</p>
<p>33. On p 69: â€œso fat gives foods their distinctive aromas and tastes.â€ What about the odor of fresh bread, hot marshmallow, citral and neral in fruit, licorice, mint, wine, beer, etc.? These are not fats.<br />
34. On p71 the statement that the increased energy in fats compared with carbs or proteins comes from their dense packing. The no-nonsense explanation is that carbs and proteins are partially oxidized because they contain oxygen and nitrogen, so oxidizing them the rest of the way to CO2 and water gives less energy than the all-hydrcarbon parts of fats.</p>
<p>35. Also on p71 is the fantasy that unsaturated fats contain less energy than than saturated because a double bond contains 10% less energy than a single bond. My old physical organic chemistry text has 80 kcal/mole for the Câ€”C single bond, and 142 kcal for the C=C double bond, a far cry from Allportâ€™s fantasy. And the energy available on digestion is given above â€” much less from mostly saturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>36. On p74 the slow melting of butter is not due to the melting points of the fatty acids in its triglycerides (fats), but the different melting points of the fats themselves.</p>
<p>37. On p78 and elsewhere Allport wrote of the high concentration of arachidonic acid and DHA in brain and nerve tissue. Her conflicted position on cholesterol is shown by her refusal to mention that the highest concentration of choleserol in the body is in the brain. But on p148 she writes that cholesterol is a necessary component of brain function</p>
<p>39. On p88 the fantasy begun by Ancel Keys that overconsumption of fats was the major health problem in the West was reiterated without any of the evidence from the books cited above that this was false.</p>
<p>40. On p89 domestic cow fat is said to be only 2% unsaturated. Know Your Fats says it is 42% unsaturated, and the CRC Handbook of 1983-4 says 52% unsaturated.<br />
43. On p100: â€œIn men, it [aspirin] cuts mortality from heart disease by more than half.â€ This is one of the most flagrant misquotations of the aspirin findings I have yet seen. Actually Bufferin cuts the number of non-fatal heart attacks by half with no change in mortality, and plain aspirin maybe by 1/3, also with no change in mortality.</p>
<p>44. On p104 a common omission characteristic of drug ads is found: â€œ&#8230;mortality from heart disease goes up linearly with the increase in omega-6s&#8230;â€ does not include the crucial all-cause mortality, without which no amount of lowered mortality from some single cause has any meaning for action.</p>
<p>46. On p107 Allport implies that the incidence of heart disease in the US has not changed from 1909-1985. In Heart Frauds by Charles T. McGee (2001), p59, heart disease death rate was shown to have changed from 15/100,000 in 1910 to a peak of 331/100,000 in 1968, then falling to 194/100,000 by 1990. McGee shows that this drop corresponded well with an increase in vitamin C intake.</p>
<p>47. On p109 there is a disconnect between Allportâ€™s generalization that seeds contain mostly omega-6s and leaves mostly omega-3s. Both canola and linseed oils are high in omega-3s which are in their seeds.</p>
<p>49. On p114 it was written that certain Nigerians with high omega-3 levels, presumably in blood, ate â€œa lot of greensâ€ and most fat was palm oil, high in saturated fats, meaning that sat fats (and the other half of palm oil, the monounsaturated oleic acid 18:1*9) do not interfere with the transformation of linolenic acid from those greens into DHA and EPA. OK, then, why did she not relent on her anti-sat fat position?</p>
<p>50. On p118, Allport actually said that â€œ&#8230;small amounts of saturated fats are better than large amounts of omega-6s.â€ This shows her conflict: such small amounts would require much less total fat consumption, and the value of this move has no positive evidence.</p>
<p>51. Also on p118 and 142, Allport minimized the dangers of trans fats, being totally unaware that controlled tests in human subjects showed serious adverse effects. RisÃ©rus U, Abner P, Brismar K, Vessby B (2002a).Â  Treatment with Dietary trans10cis12 Conjugated Linoleic Acid Causes Isomer-Specific Insulin Resistance in Obese Men with the Metabolic Syndrome.Â  Diabetes CareÂ  25(9):1516-1521; RisÃ©rus U, Basu S, Jovinge S, Fredrikson GN, Ã…rnlov J, Vessby B (2002b). Supplementation with Conjugated Linoleic Acid Causes Isomer-Dependent Oxidative Stress and Elevated C-Reactive Protein. A Potential Link to Fatty Acid-Induced Insulin Resistance.Â  CirculationÂ  106:1825-1929.</p>
<p>52. On p126 in an otherwise good discussion of bad aspects of leaky membranes, a bad simile was used: â€œ&#8230;we all know what happens to engines when they run constantly&#8230;â€ Do we? It was found by the 1960s that most car engine wear occurred immediately after startup from cold, while there was no measurable wear during constant running at moderate rpms.</p>
<p>54. On p129 Allport notes that there was not a single known case of diabetes (no type given) in Eskimos of the Umanak district in 1971 on their traditional diet. The implication is that omega-3s did the job, but no airtime was ever given to the zero-carb diets.</p>
<p>55. On p134, again, diabetes (type not given) and obesity were equated to caloric intake, not, as so often demonstrated, carb intake.</p>
<p>56. On p135 one of the classic objections to the Atkins low-carb diet is given â€” that it causes kidney and liver failure due to higher protein consumption. This was twice false, since no such damage was seen by Atkins in his patients who did raise protein intake; but more important, the missing carbs are ideally to be replaced by fat, which has no glycemic index, unlike protein with a GI of 20 or so.</p>
<p>58. On p139 the blanket recommendations to eat â€œ&#8230; lots (and lots) of fruits&#8230;â€ is very destructive to diabetics (both types) and pre-diabetics. Many kinds of fruit are high in sugars. Barry Groves, PhD, Nutrition, Richard K. Bernstein, MD, and William Cambell Douglass, Jr., MD, have avoided fruit for decades and are all in their seventies in good health.</p>
<p>59. Also on p139 the advice to avoid any high omega-6 oil is OK, but the advice to minimize butter is not. Not only is there no danger in butter, but its medium-chain fatty acids have antimicrobial properties. See Know Your Fats, above.</p>
<p>60. On p140 and 142 the advice to eat a wide variety of fish does not account for differences in EPA and DHA content, or differences in mercury content. Benefits of supplements of EPA and DHA have been shown in controlled trials.</p>
<p>61. On p143 saturated fats come in for another absurd hit, this time with the epithet â€œsolidâ€. Phew! Of course lard and tallow are not solid at body temperature! And they do not cause heart disease: Ravnskov U (1998). The Questionable Role of Saturated and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Cardiovascular Disease. Journal of Clinical EpidemiologyÂ  51:443-60.</p>
<p>62. On p144 Allport reverses herself from her position on p138 and gives amounts of EPA and DHA supplements to take daily. She wisely cautions against supplements containing omega-6s since we get too much of them anyway. But she says that strict vegetarians need more linolenic acid as though they are not getting it from eating massive amounts of leafy vegetables.</p>
<p>65. On p149 a study within the Physiciansâ€™ Health Study (the one with the misquoted and misinterpreted info on aspirin) there was a finding that 94 of 15,000 of them who experienced sudden cardiac death were 90% less likely to do so if they had the highest omega-3 levels in their blood. First, in the absence of all-cause mortality, you cannot tell whether high omega-3 levels did any overall good. Next only 0.6% of the total or 1 in 170 had this cause of death, so the benefit is pretty small. Dietary intake of omega-3s was not even given.</p>
<p>66. On p151 it is not clear whether all omega-3s in blood are measured by the commercially available tests, or whether the individual ones are assayed and reported. If EPA and DHA levels are not reported, there will be little if any value in the tests.</p>
<p>67.On p192 Allport wrote that rapeseed oil â€œ&#8230;has a high alpha linolenic acid content.â€ My CRC Handbook of 1983-4 lists 1%!!Â  Such is the result of confusing rapeseed and canola.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see from the numbering I&#8217;ve omitted some of them; for the full list, contact Dr. Kauffman at <span class="HcCDpe">kauffman at bee dot net</span>. For more on health misconceptions, read his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0741429098/ref=sethrobertand-20"><em>Malignant Medical Myths</em></a>, Infinity Publ., West Conshohocken, PA, 2006. ISBN 0-7414-2909-8 326 pp. $24.95.</p>
<p>Science, especially health science, is so important yet it is remarkably hard to learn about. Part of the problem seems to be that those who can write well (such as journalists) don&#8217;t understand the science and those who understand the science (such as scientists) can&#8217;t write well. (Another part of the problem, as Veblen pointed out, is that among academics to write clearly is low status, to writeÂ  mumbo-jumbo is high status.) This is why I like <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~len/">Leonard Mlodinow</a>&#8216;s work so much; he writes well <em>and</em> understands the science.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t misunderstand this post. <em>The Queen of Fats</em> is an excellent book. The most impressive and hopeful thing about it is that it was written by a non-scientist &#8212; in other words, that a non-scientist was able to figure out that the common neglect of omega-3 fats was seriously wrong. (Omega-3 fats receive almost no attention in <em>Eat Drink and Be Healthy</em> by Walter Willett et al. for example. There is no RDA for them.) I like to think it&#8217;s some sort of turning point that non-scientists have become able to grasp how wrong the health establishment can be; another example is Taubes&#8217;s <em>Good Calories, Bad Calories</em>.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong>. The list of errors unfortunately omitted some general comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Seven-Country Study by Ancel Keys that was so influential (cholesterol and saturated fat being &#8220;bad&#8221;) was not presented as the fraud it was. For a great description, see The Great Cholesterol Con (GCC), by Anthony Colpo (2007). For an honest Fourteen Country Study see another GCC of 2007, this one by Malcolm Kendrick, in which Kendrick showed that the 7 countries with the lowest saturated fat consumption had the highest mortality from heart disease (450/100,000 per year), while the 7 countries with the highest saturated fat intake had the lowest mortality from heart disease (170/100,000). See also The Cholesterol Myths by Uffe Ravnskov, 2000. Low-carb high-fat diets were ridiculed from start to finish as destructive and a fad, despite overwhelming evidence that they are not. See Nielsen JV, Joensson EA, Low-carbohydrate diet in type 2 diabetes. Stable improvement of bodyweight and glycaemic control during 22 months follow-up, Nutrition &#038; Metabolism 2006;3(22) doi:10.1186/1743-7075-3-22. While Allport may be correct in claiming that omega-3s will prevent or reverse diabetes (and she is not always clear on which type), the evidence is clear that type-1 is much more easily controlled with a low-carb high-fat diet, and type-2 may be controlled so well on a low-carb diet that no medication is needed. See Dr. Bernstein&#8217;s Diabetes Solution, rev. ed. by Richard K. Bernstein, MD, Boston, MA:Little, Brown, 2003. So Allport&#8217;s recommendation to eat large amounts of fruit (p139) could be a disaster for diabetics. Eskimos are often obese albeit healthy, so omega-3s for weight loss seems too much to claim. And she seems unaware of the prevalence of grain allergies. See Natural Health &#038; Weight Loss, Barry Groves, 2007; Know Your Fats by Mary G. Enig, 2000. Also Allport seems to equate eating linolenic acid as the equivalent of eating EPA and DHA in fish, and does not recommend supplements of the latter two. Neither idea had any supporting evidence presented. Nor was the ideal range of omega-3 intake given. A study of the conversion of radioisotopically-labeled linolenic acid to EPA in humans showed poor conversion, and even poorer conversion to DHA. Adequate intakes of pre-formed DHA are needed for good health. See Burdge G, alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism in men and women: nutritional and biological implications, Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care 2004;7:137-144.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Recently I visited some friends whom I hadn&#8217;t seen for a while. You&#8217;re more talkative, they said. I attribute this to flaxseed oil.</p>
<p>I became interested in the effects of flaxseed oil partly because of the aquatic ape hypothesis, the idea that living near water had a big effect on human evolution. During a long period of human prehistory, the theory says, we swam a lot, presumably to catch fish. If we ate lots of fish (high in omega-3) at the same time our brains grew large, it was quite possible that our brains need large amounts of omega-3 to function properly. Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3.</p>
<p>Elaine Morgan, the theory&#8217;s main proponent, has written several books about it, &#8220;each more po-faced [= academically correct] than the last,&#8221; she has said. I have finally read two of them and was pleased to find more scrutiny made the theory more plausible.</p>
<p>Background to the idea that humans were once aquatic is that several mammals have obviously become aquatic &#8212; starting on land they shifted to water. Sea lions, whales, and so on. Birds have become aquatic &#8212; for example, ducks. Insects have become aquatic. Elephants appear to have become aquatic and then terrestrial again &#8212; note how well they can swim. There is ample precedent, in other words.</p>
<p>Humans differ in all sorts of anatomical and physiological ways from other primates and the aquatic ape theory has straightforward explanations for many of them:</p>
<p>1. Humans have subcutaneous fat, other primates don&#8217;t. Other aquatic mammals do. Explanation: The fat serves as insulation.</p>
<p>2. Humans have almost no fur, other primates do. Other aquatic mammals don&#8217;t. Explanation: Fur creates drag in the water. In the air, fur insulates.</p>
<p>3. Humans are bipedal. Explanation: Walking upright keeps the head out of the water, allowing breathing.</p>

					<p>The results I described in <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/03/08/science-in-action-omega-3-motor-learning-surprise/">the previous post</a> surprised me because (a) my performance suddenly got better after being stable for many tests and (b) after the improvement, further practice appeared to make my performance worse. I&#8217;d never before seen either result in a motor learning situation. If you can think of an explanation of the result that practice makes performance worse, and animal learning isn&#8217;t your research area, please let me know. </p>
<p>Learning researchers used to think of associative learning as a kind of stamping-in process. The more you experience A and B together, the stronger the association between them. Simple as that. In the 1960s, however, several results called this idea into question. Situations that should have caused learning did not. The feature that united the various results was that in each case, learning didn&#8217;t happen when the animal already expected the second event. If A and B occur together, and you already expect B, there is no learning. Theories that explained these findings &#8212; <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Rescorla-Wagner_model">the Rescorla-Wagner model</a> is the best known, but <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Pearce-Hall_theory">the Pearce-Hall model</a> is the one that appears to be correct &#8212; took the discrepancy between expected and observed &#8212; an event&#8217;s &#8220;surprise factor&#8221; &#8212; rather than simply the event itself, to be what causes learning. We are constantly trying to predict the future; only when we fail do we learn.</p>
<p>In my motor-learning task, imagine that the brain &#8220;expects&#8221; a certain accuracy. When actual accuracy is less, performance improves. Performance stops improving when actual accuracy equals expected accuracy. The effect of more omega-3 in the blood, and therefore the brain, was to increase expected accuracy. (One of the main things the brain does is learn. If we do something that improves brain performance in other ways, it is plausible that it will also improve learning ability.) Thus the sudden improvement. The decrement in accuracy with further practice came about because, when the omega-3 concentration went down, actual accuracy was <em>better</em> than expected accuracy. Accuracy was &#8220;over-predicted,&#8221; a learning theorist might say. So the observed change in performance was  in the opposite-from-usual direction. Accuracy got worse, not better.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/14/60minutes/main3833797.shtml">Related happiness research</a>. &#8220;Christensen&#8217;s study was called &#8220;Why Danes Are Smug,&#8221; and essentially his answer was it&#8217;s because theyâ€™re so glum and get happy when things turn out not quite as badly as they expected.&#8221;</p>

					<p>The more I played racquetball, the more accurate my shots became &#8212; the more control I had. It was a kind of learning: learning to place the ball. I was fascinated by how little we knew about how that learning took place. I studied associative learning in my own research. The motor learning during racquetball resembled associative learning in the sense that my actions (hitting the ball with the racket) were shaped by what happened next (accuracy of placement). Yet I knew nothing non-obvious about motor learning. </p>
<p>This background of ignorance is why I find my latest flaxseed oil results so interesting. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/03/01/why-are-games-powerful-part-2/">As I&#8217;ve posted</a>, I&#8217;ve started using a new test in which I use the touchpad to &#8220;toss&#8221; the cursor from one spot to another (that is, move the cursor with a single finger movement), and measure how close it &#8220;lands&#8221; to the target. The function relating cursor position to finger position on the touchpad isn&#8217;t simple. </p>
<p>Of course I wanted to see how flaxseed oil affected performance on this task. I doubted that it would. This task is untimed. No time pressure. It is like shooting free throws. Most of the previous tasks I&#8217;ve used that have shown a flaxseed-oil effect have been tasks where you respond as fast as possible. My balance test was go at your own pace, but it involved a huge amount of computation. Balancing my body on one foot for several seconds seemed to involve a lot more computation than moving a finger about an inch.</p>
<p>Usually I take 4 tablespoons of flaxseed oil just before bedtime. One recent day I took it much earlier and  did the toss test at 30-minute intervals before and for several hours afterward.</p>
<p>Here are the results plotted as a function of test session number.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2044/2317981731_94ba1702bf.jpg?v=0" alt="toss results vs condition" /></p>
<p>Here are the same results plotted versus the time of the test:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3017/2318790576_80bd5bea40.jpg?v=0" alt="toss accuracy vs. time of test" /></p>
<p>Here is a close-up of the crucial data:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2253/2317982129_42f0a7d137.jpg?v=0" alt="toss accuracy vs. time of session (close-up)" /></p>
<p>About two hours after I drank the flaxseed oil, my accuracy got <em>worse</em>. Then it slowly got much better. The amazing thing about the improvement is that it reached a maximum long after you would think that the effects of the flaxseed oil had worn off. My overall level of omega-3 is high because I take 4 T flaxseed oil per day. The effect of shifting when I drink the 4 T is just to change the timing of a short-lived peak. Usually that peak happens when I&#8217;m asleep and my omega-3 levels are reasonably constant while I&#8217;m doing the test. In this case the peak happened while I was doing the test.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll discuss what this might mean in a later post.</p>

					<p><em>Drug</em> addiction, sure. The first pleasurable drugs were probably discovered hundreds of thousands of years ago, if not much earlier. All cultures use drugs. Drugs physically reach the brain. But <em>video game</em> addiction? Video games are a millisecond old, compared to drugs. How did they get so potent so fast?</p>
<p>Self-experimentation made me ask. Using an ordinary psychological test and a speeded arithmetic task, I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/30/science-in-action-omega-3-a-surprise/">discovered </a>a fast-acting effect of flaxseed oil. About two hours after ingestion of 4 tablespoons, my brain worked detectably better. The effect wore off over several hours. To properly study this effect, and exploit it to learn more about what fats we should eat (which has been very hard to figure out), I would have to test myself many times per day for many days. Thousands of tests. It would be a lot easier if the tests were fast, portable, and fun &#8212; especially fun. Many computer games have these traits. But they don&#8217;t provide the data I need, which is a measure of how well my brain is working, and they take too long.</p>
<p>After talking with <a href="http://studio.berkeley.edu/niemeyer/bio.html">Greg Niemeyer</a>, I came up with four properties, shared by many games, that might be why they are fun: 1. Right difficulty level. Neither too easy nor too hard. This is a variable emphasized by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi/dp/0060920432">Flow</a></em>. 2. Feedback. You learn how well you are doing. 3. Variety. Not the same thing over and over. 4. Color. I constructed a task with all four features. To my dismay, it wasn&#8217;t fun! (So much for the placebo effect.) I had to force myself to do it.</p>
<p>I had no idea what was wrong. Then, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/02/07/the-lessons-of-bilboquet/">as I&#8217;ve written</a>, a friend gave me a bilboquet, which led me to think that there were two principles of fun-making I&#8217;d left out: 1. Hand-eye coordination. We enjoy tasks that involve this. 2. Completion. We enjoy tasks where something is cleared up or put neatly together.</p>
<p>I used these ideas to construct a new test. It consisted of moving the cursor around the screen from one colored circle to the next. I move the cursor to a circle and click on it. That circle disappears and a new circle appears somewhere else. It&#8217;s a bit like shooting one circle after another. Aim, click, aim, click. Each circle is effectively a new trial. The speed at which I moved the cursor to the new circle and click on it is the main measure. There is trial-by-trial feedback: the color of the next circle depends on how quickly I got to the last circle. Here&#8217;s a screen shot (cursor not shown):</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2326/2302353562_83cce562b2.jpg?v=0" alt="circle game" /></p>
<p>I did this on a Thinkpad. I used the trackpoint to move the cursor. This had the pleasant feature that there was no obvious learning curve &#8212; I didn&#8217;t improve with practice. Presumably because I have years of practice with the trackpoint</p>
<p>Eventually I got around to the big question: Was this test sensitive to the effects of flaxseed oil? I&#8217;ve done two series of measurements to answer this. Here are the results from the first series:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/2302353648_92fcecac4c.jpg?v=0" alt = "1st test of flaxseed oil with circle game" /></p>
<p>The green line shows when I drank 4 tablespoons of flaxseed oil (without lignans). Here are the results from the second series:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2077/2302353894_968ceefb14.jpg?v=0" alt="2nd test of flaxseed oil with circle game" /></p>
<p>Again, the green line shows when I drank 4 tablespoons of flaxseed oil. </p>
<p>Both times the results resembled my previous results. The flaxseed oil appeared to cause a decrease (= improvement), which reached a maximum around 2 hours after ingestion and declined. The results were far from beautiful but because of the similarity to earlier results (<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/13/science-in-action-omega-3-time-course/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/20/science-in-action-omega-3-time-course-2-with-eggs/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/22/science-in-action-omega-3-vse/">here</a>) I found them fairly persuasive. They certainly suggest doing more with this test.</p>
<p>Then I made a different game&#8230;</p>

					<p>Anonymous writes again:</p>
<blockquote><p>I got caught in a nasty achilles lock the other day&#8211;it&#8217;s an MMA [mixed martial art] submission move&#8211;and while trying to escape, I accidentally dislocated my fibula at the knee. It made a LOUD popping noise, to the point where everyone in the gym stopped. It popped it back in immediately, and other than some instability, it felt OK. Thankfully there was a doctor there (by chance&#8211;he does MMA and was in my class). He spent like 15 minutes examining  my knee and said that other than some stretched ligaments, it was fine. His quote (I&#8217;m paraphrasing):</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing. You should need reconstructive surgery right now. I don&#8217;t know how that happened, you must have rubber ligaments.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him about taking 4 tablespoons of flax seed oil every day, and he was shocked, and said he was going to research it to see if that could be why I got so lucky. Told him to Google you, it&#8217;s all there.</p>
<p>The injury happened Friday. Today (Tuesday) the doctor looked at my knee again in class, and he was amazed not only at the lack of swelling, but that I was able to roll today (not full speed, just lightly).</p>
<p>I have played sports my whole life and have had at least half a dozen various knee injuries. Things like minor cartilage tears, hyperextensions, strains, etc.&#8211;none that were this major (a dislocation of a bone at the joint). Of those injuries, I was out longer and recovered much slower than I have with this one. I know this isn&#8217;t proof of anything, and I don&#8217;t know how much the flaxseed oil has had to do with what happened, but even the doctor is shocked.</p></blockquote>

					<p>When I buy flaxseed oil, I have a choice: with or without lignans. I almost always choose without. Apparently that&#8217;s the right choice, witness <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=5995.msg63455#msg63455">this from the SLD forums</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out what besides overeating might cause these flare ups with my gallbladder. It seems clear from the last few days that one of the things that can set it off is Flax Seed Oil with lignans. When I consume 2-3 tablespoons a day of FSO without lignans, I don&#8217;t notice any problems. The FSO goes down easy and I don&#8217;t feel nausea or pain. But with the lignans I often do. To be sure, I decided to switch from FSO to ground up flax seeds mixed into my oatmeal. And today, the first time I tried that, an hour later the familiar nausea is back.</p></blockquote>
