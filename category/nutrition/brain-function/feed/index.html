<p>This graph shows recent results from the test I used to track my brain function. The test is a choice reaction task done on my laptop: see a digit (e.g.,&#8221;2&#8243;), press the corresponding key as fast as possible. The <em>x</em> axis shows the time of the test. The ticks (&#8220;Sat&#8221;, etc.) mark the beginning of the associated days. The <em>y</em> axis shows the average percentile of the reaction times. Higher percentile = faster. (Let me explain what &#8220;percentile&#8221; means: Each reaction time is compared to earlier reaction times with the same stimulus, and its percentile is computed. For example, a percentile of 60 means that 60% of previous responses were slower.) An average of 60 is quite good and 40 is quite bad. I usually do two tests per day, one right after the other, in the late afternoon (e.g., 4:30 pm).<span id="more-13109"></span></p>
<p>On Friday and Saturday, my scores were close to normal. On Sunday afternoon, however, my scores were much worse than usual; the average score was about 15. A score that low might happen once per year. The next day (Monday) I tested more often than usual &#8212; both morning and afternoon &#8212; and my scores gradually returned to normal. On Tuesday I also tested both morning and afternoon. My scores were ordinary the whole time. This showed that the improvement Monday morning was not normal.</p>
<p>What happened Sunday? I am pretty sure the problem is my lunch at a middle-cost noodle restaurant whose English name is <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294212-d5482531-Reviews-Flying_Noodle-Beijing.html" target="_blank">Flying Noodle</a>. It is close to the Tsinghua campus but I&#8217;d only been there once before (and eaten almost nothing that time). On Sunday I had a small pickled vegetable dish and an ordinary-sized plate of fried eggs and tomatoes. I suspect the problem is the oil used to cook the egg and tomato. It might have been soybean, corn, sunflower or peanut oil, all high in omega-6. (There are also complaints about reuse of cooking oil.) As I entered the restaurant, I worried about the oil, but also thought <i>who really knows? </i>By the time of my brain test, I had forgotten my concern.</p>
<p>A friend was with me. She ate different dishes. She found that her scores on a iPhone game she often plays, which requires fast reactions, were suddenly and mysteriously worse after the lunch. Then, in about a day, they recovered.</p>
<p>This interests me in several ways:</p>
<p>1. <strong>New phenomenology</strong>. In this example and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">my earlier tofu results</a> (a piece of fermented tofu reduced my brain score for two days), I noticed something never noticed before: Sharp changes (bad) in brain function. Fortunately I quickly recovered. Nobody knew this happened. It&#8217;s like looking through a microscope or telescope for the first time, but with much more relevance to everyday concerns. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Comparison with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me" target="_blank"><i>Super Size Me</i></a></strong>, a 2004 documentary by Morgan Spurlock, which argued that McDonald&#8217;s food was unhealthy. Spurlock ate only McDonald&#8217;s food for 30 days. Realism: Spurlock ate far more McDonald&#8217;s food than anyone would normally eat; I ate one meal. Information value: Spurlock&#8217;s test was so unrealistic and his diet so plainly unhealthy that I doubt the results &#8212; Spurlock&#8217;s health got worse, he gained weight &#8212; have any implications for the rest of us. In contrast, I find my results horrifying. Bias: Spurlock was obviously biased against McDonald&#8217;s before he started. I thought favorably of the Flying Noodle &#8212; that&#8217;s why I went there. Cost: My data cost essentially nothing, Spurlock&#8217;s movie <a href="http://www.filmeducation.org/pdf/film/SuperSizeMe.pdf" target="_blank">cost $65,000</a>, not to mention the damage to Spurlock&#8217;s health. Recovery time: Spurlock took 14 months to lose the weight he gained. I recovered in a day. Repeatability: My test is easy to repeat, Spurlock&#8217;s very difficult.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Public health disaster?</strong> China has a very high rate of diabetes, for unknown reasons. Chinese teenagers and college students have much worse (inflamed) skin than I see in other countries. Old people in China look much worse than old people in Japan. Could heavy use of high-omega-6 cooking oil be a big reason? </p>
<p>4. <strong>Where were authorities?</strong> We expect our government &#8212; in combination with academia &#8212; to protect us against dangerous chemicals in our environment. If I&#8217;m right about the cause of my low score, that didn&#8217;t happen here. Cooking oil is the opposite of a rare food. If ordinary amounts of a common cooking oil did cause these results, it suggests something is seriously wrong with the regulatory system. A big argument for personal science &#8212; and brain tracking in particular &#8212; is that you monitor exactly the environment to which you are exposed in exactly the genetic context you care about (yours).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://s919.photobucket.com/user/twoutopias/media/2i014-01-10berkeleyvsbeijingreactiontime_zps221e5bf7.jpeg.html" target="_blank"><img alt=" photo 2i014-01-10berkeleyvsbeijingreactiontime_zps221e5bf7.jpeg" src="http://i919.photobucket.com/albums/ad40/twoutopias/2i014-01-10berkeleyvsbeijingreactiontime_zps221e5bf7.jpeg" border="0" /></a> This graph shows my brain test reaction times over roughly one year. Each point is a different test; I usually do two tests per day back to back. I assume faster = better. In February 2013 I returned to Berkeley from Beijing. In August 2013 I went back to Beijing. When I returned to Berkeley, my scores got worse (slower). I was shocked. <em>Surely Berkeley is healthier than Beijing</em>. At first I thought it was jet lag, but the scores stayed worse long after that made sense. Then I thought it might be some difference in diet, even though I eat similar food in the two places. I tried to make my Berkeley diet closer to my Beijing diet. This might have helped. I noticed accidentally that chocolate improved my score and started eating chocolate frequently. This artificially reduced the difference since in Beijing I had not been eating chocolate. In Berkeley I started doing two things I hadn&#8217;t done in Beijing: alternate-day fasting and whole-body vibration. I don&#8217;t know if they made a difference. When I returned to Beijing in September, my scores got better, even though I was not eating chocolate. Eventually I improved my sleep in Beijing but that seemed to make little difference. The comparison is far from perfect &#8212; many things varied &#8212; but by and large my scores got worse when I went from Beijing to Berkeley and improved when I went from Berkeley to Beijing. </p>
<p>What might have caused this? There are a hundred possibilities but one stands out. In both places, I brew and drink several cups of tea every day. In Beijing, everyone, including me, drinks water from big plastic bottles that are delivered to your house. You can choose pure water or &#8220;mineral&#8221; water, which has  added magnesium and potassium. In Berkeley I use tap water (Brita filtered). I don&#8217;t think potassium affects brain function &#8212; for example, eating bananas makes no difference &#8212; but there is <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/testing-magnesium-s-brain-boosting-effects-1.11665" target="_blank">plenty of evidence that magnesium improves brain function</a>. In Beijing I had tested a magnesium supplement and found no effect, consistent with the idea that I was already getting enough. Magnesium is also believed to improve sleep. In Beijing I seemed to sleep better than in Berkeley. Again, this is consistent with a difference in magnesium levels (more in Beijing). If ordinary magnesium-enriched water improves brain function, it would be significant because it is so easy, in contrast to <a href="http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2012/feb2012_Novel-Magnesium-Compound-Reverses-Neurodegeneration_01.htm" target="_blank">other ways of increasing magnesium levels</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six years ago I started using a reaction-time (RT) test (a test where you press a key in response to something as fast as possible) to track my brain function. I took the test daily. It must use only a small part of the brain but I assumed that something that made me faster would probably improve overall brain function. Behind this belief, which I call <strong>better RT, better brain</strong>, were countless studies of brain anatomy and physiology, which had shown that neurons and glial cells all over the brain share many features. Cells in different parts of the brain are much more alike than different. More support for this assumption was that <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">certain doses of flaxseed oil improved both RT and other measures of brain function</a>, such as balance.</p>
<p>I also assumed that changes that improved RT would probably improve overall health &#8212; what I call the<strong> better RT, better body</strong> assumption. It was less plausible than the <strong>better RT, better brain </strong>assumption because the cells in different organs of the body differ so much. They have many similarities but also many differences. I believed it for two reasons. (a) Flaxseed oil not only improved several measures of brain function, it improved my gums, no doubt because it reduced inflammation. It had been far from obvious that improving gums was so easy or that flaxseed oil (in the right dosage) would do so. The assumption <strong>better RT, better body</strong> had made a surprising prediction, you could say, that turned out to be true. (b) The brain gets much the same blood as the rest of the body. (Not exactly the same, because of the blood-brain barrier.) In the same way, all plug-in electrical appliances use the same house current. Just as all appliances have been designed to work well with that current, all our organs should have been shaped by evolution to work well with same mix of nutrients. You can&#8217;t feed your brain differently than your heart.</p>
<p>When I discovered that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">butter improved RT</a>, the <strong>better RT, better body</strong> assumption made a second even more surprising prediction: Eating more butter improved my health. This contradicted the claims of all mainstream health experts, who say saturated fats cause heart disease. I stuck with my assumption &#8212; I still eat a lot of butter. The data I&#8217;ve seen since then has supported my conclusion. For example, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/28/new-heart-scan-results-good-news/" target="_blank">my Agatston score got better</a>, not worse, after a year of eating lots of butter. The Agatston score is currently <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health-pictures/the-single-best-predictor-of-a-heart-attack.aspx#/slide-1" target="_blank">the best predictor of heart disease</a>.</p>
<p>I recently found more support for the <strong>better RT, better body </strong>assumption. Several studies have found that RT is a good predictor of health (better RT, better health). Even more impressive, it is a better predictor than many of the predictors we already know of. The RT test used in these studies is close to the test I now use, which I developed independently. The RT test in these studies involves showing a digit (0-4), after which the subject presses one of five keys (labelled 0-4) as fast as possible. My current RT test is very similar but uses 7 digits instead of 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15660853" target="_blank">A 2005 study</a> looked at the oft-reported correlation between higher IQ and lower mortality. The IQs and RTs of about 900 persons were measured in 1988. Deaths until 2002 were noted. RT was associated with lower mortality, even after taking out associations with smoking, education and social class. RT and IQ are correlated (better RT, higher IQ). When the RT-death association was removed, IQ no longer predicted death. So RT does a good job of capturing whatever it is about IQ that predicts mortality.</p>
<p><a href="http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/7.-Reaction-time-and-established-risk-factors-for-total-and-cardiovascular-disease-mortality.pdf" target="_blank">A 2009 study</a> compared RT to more conventional health predictors (&#8220;risk factors&#8221;). About 7,000 subjects were followed from 1984 to 2005. RT in 1984 was a good predictor of all-cause mortality compared to classic risk factors. Smoking was by far the best predictor, followed by RT. RT was a better predictor than physical activity, blood pressure, a questionnaire measuring &#8220;psychological distress&#8221;, resting heart rate, waist/hip ratio, alcohol intake, and body mass index.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17846257" target="_blank">A third study</a>, based on the same subjects as the 2009 study, found that amount of <em>decline</em> (slowing) in RT (from one test to a second test seven years later) predicted death. People with more decline were more likely to die.</p>
<p>All this supports studying how your RT is controlled by your environment, especially what you eat. You have to choose wisely what to study. The point is not to be as fast as possible regardless of everything else. Lots of drugs (stimulants, such as caffeine) decrease RT for short periods of time. I doubt they improve health. (If they harm sleep, they probably worsen health.) What makes sense is to look for two things: 1. <strong>Poisons</strong>. Things that slow you down. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">I discovered that tofu did so</a>. I gave several reasons for thinking that tofu affects many people this way, not just me. Billions of people eat tofu, unaware of this possibility. 2. <strong>Deficiencies</strong>. Study things that are missing from your life now but were likely to be present when we evolved. It is quite plausible that our ancient ancestors ate more omega-3 (in fish, but also in flaxseed) and more animal fat (from big animals, but also in butter) than we do now. My data suggest omega-3 and animal fat are nutrients necessary for health whose importance mainstream nutrition researchers have not fully appreciated.</p>
<p>My RT data have shown me there&#8217;s a lot I didn&#8217;t/don&#8217;t know about how my food affects me. Maybe everyone can say that. Unlike almost anyone else, however, I can reduce my ignorance myself. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/">I don&#8217;t need to rely on experts</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I posted that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">tofu made me stupid</a> &#8212; made me slower on a reaction-time test &#8212; a reader named Ann, who lives in Florida, said she had discovered that her migraine headaches were caused by soy. How she discovered this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was 49 years old and in that hot flashes stage of life, had read that soy could help alleviate them and tried a soy capsule not at a meal, immediately noticed sinus pressure and itchiness.</p>
<p>So I started reading all labels and eliminated soy from my diet and my migraines and sinus headaches went away! The hot flashes eventually went away on their own. I was losing whole days every month to the migraines. Every now and then the soy sneaks in at a restaurant but not as bad as before. Whenever anyone says they have migraines I always suggest looking at soy. Regretfully my daughter has the same issue, but she has way fewer headaches after eliminating soy.</p>
<p>I used to blame a lot of my headaches on allergies, never thinking it could be something I was eating. At age 60 now, my cholesterol numbers are excellent and I weigh 122 pounds when so many of my friends are overweight.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked how long it had taken to discover this.</p>
<blockquote><p>I had been having migraines for years, 10-20, but in the mid 90s they got worse (could have coincided with more soy in food).  Saw a doctor but he just prescribed imitrex which helped but did not prevent them. He never suggested looking for a food cause. It was dumb luck or divine intervention that I tried that soy capsule in 2001 or 2002. I am often amazed at how much better I feel health wise since then. Since soy is in so much processed food my diet is very basic &#8220;real&#8221; food. Raw fruits and veggies, plain nuts, fresh meat, real cheese, eggs, yogurt, any desserts I make from scratch with real butter. I&#8217;m always excited when I find a cracker that doesn&#8217;t have soy since that&#8217;s usually my bread substitute.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me repeat part of that: A doctor she saw because of migrains did not suggest trying to find an environmental cause. The same thing happened to <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html" target="_blank">a woman I wrote about for Boing Boing</a>. Her doctor just prescribed one drug after another. Her migraines turned out to be caused by cleaning products. Not knowing that migraines often have environmental causes is like not knowing the germ theory of disease. </p>
<p>Few soy eaters realize the dangers of soy, as far as I can tell. I wrote to one of them, <a href="http://www.theveganrd.com/about" target="_blank">Virginia Messina</a>, a nutritionist who has said &#8220;there is no reason to believe that eating soyfoods is harmful to brain aging.&#8221; She has not replied.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://uhs.berkeley.edu/home/healthtopics/pdf/triggers.pdf" target="_blank">long list of possible migraine triggers</a> (from the UC Berkeley health service) does <strong>not</strong> list soy, although it does mention soy sauce. It says soy milk should be safe. In a 2006 interview,  <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5364970" target="_blank">one headache doctor</a> recommended avoiding all soy. In the comments to <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/01/24/migraine-triggers-may-not-be-so-potent-after-all/" target="_blank">this</a>, a woman says:</p>
<blockquote><p>SOY is the biggest trigger for my migraines.  For years I suffered daily from migraines but after watching EVERYTHING I eat and reading all labels and avoiding SOY as best I can I am doing better.  The biggest problem is that SOY is in everything!!!!  I think one day they will find out how bad it is for us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine that. Putting something that damages the brain in everything.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been testing my brain function daily for the last six years. I use a reaction-time test (see digit, type digit as fast as possible) that takes about five minutes. I have gradually improved the test over the years &#8212; this is about version 8. One reason for this testing is that I might observe a sudden change. That could suggest a new factor that affects brain function &#8212; whatever was unusual before the change (e.g., a new food). This is how I discovered <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">the effect of butter</a>. My score suddenly improved, I investigated. Another sudden change (improvement) happened soon after I switched from Chinese flaxseed oil to American flaxseed oil. I hadn&#8217;t realized that something was wrong with the Chinese flaxseed oil. I started brain tracking after I noticed a sudden improvement in balance the morning after I swallowed about five flaxseed oil capsules. Millions of people had taken flaxseed oil capsules, but no one, it seemed, had noticed the balance improvement. <em>Maybe other big changes in brain function go unnoticed</em>, I thought.</p>
<p><span id="more-12281"></span></p>
<p>A month ago, my score suddenly got worse (= I became slower). There was one unusual thing that day, before the test: I had eaten a piece of <em>bai fu ru</em>, a kind of fermented tofu popular in China. <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/09/chichis-chinese-fermented-bean-curd.html" target="_blank">To make it</a>, &#8220;cubes of tofu are first fermented, then soaked in brines that contain a number of ingredients: rice wine, vinegar, chili peppers, cinnamon, star anise, and red yeast rice, the last which imparts the deep red hue that you&#8217;ll see in certain varieties.&#8221; <a href="http://www.kcet.org/living/food/the-nosh/have-you-eaten/4-ways-to-enjoy-stinky-tofu-in-los-angeles.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a discussion of fermented tofu in Los Angeles. It&#8217;s popular in China. Most people use it as a condiment, but I ate small amounts (one cube)  alone.</p>
<p>To find out if the <em>bai fu ru</em> caused the worsening, I did a test. I deliberately ate one 20 g cube at 11 am. I do the brain tests in the afternoon, usually 4-5 pm. What happen to my brain score that day? Here are the results.</p>
<p><a href="http://s919.photobucket.com/user/twoutopias/media/2013-12-01tofuslowsdownbraintofuplot_zpsceffdd58.jpeg.html" target="_blank"><img alt=" photo 2013-12-01tofuslowsdownbraintofuplot_zpsceffdd58.jpeg" src="http://i919.photobucket.com/albums/ad40/twoutopias/2013-12-01tofuslowsdownbraintofuplot_zpsceffdd58.jpeg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Each point is a different test. I conclude that the tofu slowed me down by about 20 ms and the effect lasted two days. I didn&#8217;t notice the change in other ways &#8212; I didn&#8217;t feel tired or slow, for example. Presumably that is why this has gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>I think these results reflect cause and effect for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Clarity</strong>. A <em>t</em> value would be very large.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Surprising prediction</strong>. A surprising prediction turned out to be true. Sharp drops like this are rare. Perhaps they happen once every 3-6 months.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Repetition</strong>. A research assistant found similar results, although not as clear. She is Chinese &#8212; quite different genetically.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Other evidence that tofu is bad for the brain</strong>. After I found these results, I remembered <a href="http://www.healthmegamall.com/Articles/BabeskinArticle260.pdf" target="_blank">an old study</a>. It found an association between midlife tofu consumption and late life cognitive decline among Japanese-American men in Hawaii (more tofu, more decline). <a href="http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/soy-online-service/Brain.htm#.UpVOQcRQKm4" target="_blank">A related study</a> of the same men found a correlation between cognitive decline and miso consumption. <a href="http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/141484" target="_blank">A later study of Indonesian men and women</a> also found a correlation between tofu consumption and cognitive decline (more tofu, more decline). The same study also found a <em>beneficial</em> weak correlation between tempeh consumption and cognitive decline (more tempeh, less decline). A weak epidemiological association found only once means little &#8212; epidemiologists, in my experience, do not adjust for the number of tests done and usually ignore the problem.  More recently, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23034522" target="_blank">an experiment using a mouse model of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</a> found that a high-soy diet made brain function worse.</p>
<p>Because of the other evidence, I conclude that all tofu (and other soybean foods, such as soy milk) probably impair brain function, not just this version, which contains slightly more than tofu. The other evidence involves lots of non-fermented tofu. Because of the other evidence and my assistant&#8217;s results, I believe these results will be true for other people.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t explain the effect. Tofu is high in omega-6, but the amount of omega-6 in 20 g of tofu is small. Others think that tofu impair brain function due to its isoflavones.</p>
<p>Most nutrition experts say tofu is good for you. Catherine Newman, in <em>O Magazine</em>, <a href="http://www.oprah.com/health/The-Health-Benefits-of-Tofu-and-Soy-Products" target="_blank">raves about it</a>. &#8220;In addition to being wonderfully inexpensive, tofu is high in protein, low in fat, and very low in saturated fat. . . .  One daily four-ounce [= 120 g] serving is an excellent addition to a healthy diet.&#8221; <a href="http://w3.newsmax.com/newsletters/mhr/issues/eat1012/mhr_eat1012_29.pdf" target="_blank"><em>The Mind Health Report</em> (October 2012)</a> says tofu is good for the brain. &#8220;For vegetarians, good choices are tofu, beans and eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Better informed experts criticize soy but say <em>fermented</em> soy is good. <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/09/18/soy-can-damage-your-health.aspx" target="_blank">Joseph Mercola</a> wrote,&#8221;For centuries, Asian people have been consuming fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits.&#8221; The <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/" target="_blank">Weston Price Foundation website</a> says a lot about the badness of soy but claims fermented soy is healthy. In an article about why unfermented soy is bad, <a href="http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/170-scientific-reasons-to-lose-the-soy-in-your-diet/" target="_blank">the Healthy Home Economist says</a>, &#8220;Please note that fermented soy in small, condimental amounts as practiced in traditional Asian cultures is fine for those who have healthy thyroid function [as I do -- Seth].&#8221; My 20 g dose was a small, condimental amount. John Robbins, author of <em>The Food Revolution </em>(2001), dismissed the association of tofu and dementia. <a href="http://www.foodrevolution.org/askjohn/52.htm" target="_blank">He argued</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s not all we know. We know, for example, that dementia rates are lower in Asian countries (where soy intake is high) than in western countries. We know that the Japanese lifestyle (with its high soy intake) has long been associated with longer life span and better cognition in old age. And we know that Seventh Day Adventists, many of whom consume soyfoods their whole lives, have less dementia in old age than the general population. . . . A number of clinical studies have shown that soy and isoflavones from soy are actually beneficial for cognition. . . . . Having studied the literature, soy researchers Mark and Virginia Messina conclude that “there is no reason to believe that eating soyfoods is harmful to brain aging.” [Robbins failed to mention that <a href="http://www.vegnutrition.com/about/index.html" target="_blank">Mark and Virginia Messina</a> own a "nutrition consulting company specializing in soyfoods nutrition" -- Seth]</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when the Messinas said this. Maybe there was once &#8220;no reason&#8221; to think soyfoods bad for the brain, but there is now.  The new evidence, epidemiology, and mouse evidence make a good case.</p>
<p>Here are two interesting things. 1. A very popular food is dangerous, maybe harmful. 2. Nutrition experts had claimed the opposite: the food is good for you. Even the better ones (Mercola, Weston Price Foundation) got it wrong, ignoring evidence (the epidemiology). It is a good example of experts overstating their understanding. The Shangri-La Diet is another example (every expert said sugar was fattening, I found it caused me to lose weight).</p>
<p>Even more interesting is the methodological implication. <em>Anyone can do what I did, with any food</em>. It&#8217;s easy, safe, cheap, and takes little time. The bad effects were large enough, and the method sensitive enough, that the bad effects were well above noise. And this is a non-trivial case. Tofu is popular.</p>
<p>We eat thousands of foods. We have millions of genotypes. We eat our food in millions of environments. Your genotype and environment affect how a food will affect you. So a good understanding of how foods affect us would seem to require thousands times millions times millions of tests. It is absurd to assume that anyone else (government, academia, industry) will do the necessary tests. They can&#8217;t <em>begin</em> to do the tests. In contrast to people doing a job (for example, people in government responsible for food safety) <strong>you</strong> have a much simpler problem: <strong>Is my food safe for me? </strong>You only care about one genotype (yours) and one context (yours) and you eat far fewer than thousands of foods. You can do good tests. You can test exactly what you eat in exactly the context you eat it. Compared to the present, where we extrapolate from epidemiology, animal tests, and the rare human experiment, the reduction in uncertainty and increase in generalizability is immense.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">If you want to do experiments like this &#8212; test foods one by one &#8212; with my software (which requires Windows), please contact me. The tests require a training period of 1-2 months so that the scores during an experiment are roughly constant.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nutritionj.com/content/12/1/121" target="_blank">An article in the latest <em>Nutrition Journal</em></a> says that a &#8220;proprietary&#8221; extract of chicken meat, called CMI-168, improved brain function. From the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Normal, healthy subjects were supplemented with either placebo or CMI-168 for 6 weeks. The subjects were given a series of cognitive tests to examine their levels of cognitive functioning at the beginning and end of supplementation, as well as two weeks after termination of supplementation. The combination of these tests, namely Digit Span Backwards, Letter-Number Sequencing, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), was used to assess the subjects’ attention and working memory. . . . Subjects supplemented with CMI-168 showed significantly (p &lt; 0.01) better performance in all cognitive tests after 6 weeks’ supplementation compared to [placebo] and [their] superior performance was maintained even 2 weeks after termination of supplementation.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve heard that something in chicken improves brain function. The abstract understates the strength of the evidence; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001 (not 0.01) in almost all relevant comparisons.</p>
<p>However, several details make me question the claim.<span id="more-11503"></span></p>
<p>1. Two of the five authors work for the company that sells the chicken extract.</p>
<p>2. The subject recruitment makes no sense. &#8220;A total of 46 healthy male and female subjects aged between 35 and 65 years were recruited either as walk-in or referred from their general practitioners for counseling for life-style related issues.&#8221; Walk-in? &#8220;Life-style related issues&#8221;? &#8220;Counseling&#8221;? I have never heard of such things in this context. Nothing is said about payment or the fraction of people who declined to participate.</p>
<p>3. Vague statistics. I cannot tell if pre-treatment scores were used to make the treatment scores more sensitive. Someone who does better than average before treatment is likely to do better than average after treatment &#8212; you want to adjust for that.</p>
<p>4. No apparent learning effect. Subjects in the placebo group did not clearly improve from test to test. There is usually a big learning effect with such tests. Nothing is said about learning effects.</p>
<p>5. Vague supporting evidence. &#8220;Anecdotal evidence has long associated EOC [essence of chicken] with improving cognitive performance, especially related to learning and memory, as well as executive function,&#8221; says the paper. It provides no documentation of this evidence.</p>
<p>6. Uniformly positive results. The paper emphasizes results from nine different tests of brain function. All showed significant improvement at the same <em>p</em> value (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). When I used four different tests to measure the brain effects of flaxseed oil, different tests had widely different sensitivities.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been able to find anything supporting the idea that chicken meat (or extract) improves memory other than what this company says. <span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">I asked a Chinese friend about this; she too had never heard this claim.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.brandsworld.us/en/home/index.php" target="_blank">The company behind this</a><span style="font-size: 13px;"> (Brand&#8217;s) is more than a hundred years old, and essence of chicken has been their main product. In spite of my doubts, however, I would still like to test the product to see what effect it has on my reaction-time measure of brain function.</span></p>
<p>Strangely enough, after writing this post weeks ago, I noticed by accident that <strong>duck</strong> seemed to improve my brain function. I was stunned &#8212; as I said, I had never heard such a thing. I&#8217;ll describe the data later.</p>
