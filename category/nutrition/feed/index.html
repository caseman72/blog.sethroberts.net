				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Allan Folz</h4>
<p>My story of omega 3 and self-experimentation did not end with my wife and her pregnancy. As I mentioned, I discovered the paleo diet, Vitamin D, and fish oil all about the same time. Mostly for reasons of general good health we began supplementing with vitamin D and fish oil (Mega-EPA Omega-3 supplement). I ordered some of each from the same place online and we began supplementing both at the same time, around January-February of 2010.<span id="more-13522"></span></p>
<p>At the time my son was in kindergarten and having problems socializing at school. He had them at home too, but we&#8217;d all adjusted to them at home. He exhibited a lot of what would be called typical spectrum issues, though I was certain he didn&#8217;t have anything approaching Asperger&#8217;s. Things that interested him, such as building with Legos playing outside with or without friends, he did quite well. It struck me that he was a high-energy boy who didn&#8217;t appreciate receiving directions, desk work, or anything requiring moderation and self-reflection. I like to joke that Tom Sawyer is hardly a modern archetype.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he was having problems. The Vitamin D Council web site had a number of very persuasive anecdotes from parents about autistic children cured by Vitamin D. Our son wasn&#8217;t autistic, but autism involves several behaviors, and he had a few of them. He didn&#8217;t make good eye contact when talking or being talked to. He wouldn&#8217;t follow directions if he didn&#8217;t feel an intrinsic motivation to follow them. He could not fall asleep and would often lay in bed restless for an hour or more at night. The Vitamin D Council recommended 2000 IU per 50 lb/day, so that&#8217;s what we all took. We also took one fish oil capsule a week. At the time I thought of omega-3 only being for heart health. This made me a little skeptical about how much was really required. We seemed a healthy family, so I figured our needs were modest. One capsule a week seemed well beyond the norm so we should be good.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after beginning the supplements my son&#8217;s behavior improved. I was pleasantly surprised and attributed it to the Vitamin D based on what I&#8217;d read on the Vitamin D Council web site. It wasn&#8217;t a cure by any means, but it was a very noticeable improvement. He would still have bad days, and I was a little bummed that after the initial improvement the Vitamin D didn&#8217;t seem to be helping any further. However, I figured such is real-life outside of attention-grabbing headlines.</p>
<p>Two years later, January and February of 2012, second grade for him, and about a year and a half after the self-experiment with my wife during her third pregnancy, my son&#8217;s behavior dramatically worsened. We were all still taking D, but at that point it was obviously not showing any benefit for my son. He was in a worse place than when he was in kindergarten. I resigned myself to Vitamin D not being his problem, and at his teacher&#8217;s demand signed him up for outside testing.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t notice at the time, but we had run out of the “fish oil” over Christmas break. The second week of January we visited family in the Midwest. When we returned, school was a nightmare for him and us. My wife and I attributed it to too much TV, bad diet, and not enough sleep while we were visiting family. However, even two and three weeks after our return his problems were worsening. Around the beginning of February, I finally got around to ordering another bottle of the omega-3. I thought of it as mostly being for my wife, who was doing fine, so I didn&#8217;t feel any immediacy. When it finally arrived, we all started taking it again. Immediately his behavior improved. It was such a night and day difference the connection was impossible to miss. It was like kindergarten when he first started taking Vitamin D, only far more so. For the first time in two weeks he wasn&#8217;t angry and crying at the end of the day. That&#8217;s when it occurred to me that in kindergarten he started taking fish oil at the same time as Vitamin D. For the last two years I had been attributing to Vitamin D what was due to the omega-3 supplement. I felt like an idiot.</p>
<p>After that, I did some research on omega-3, fish oil, and ADHD. When I knew what to look for, I found that there were, in fact, a few studies about using omega-3 for ADHD treatment. It seemed that EPA was effectie while DHA was not, or at best, less effective than EPA. When I took a closer look at our “fish oil,” I remember thinking to myself, &#8220;Oh wow, this stuff is Mega-EPA. How lucky is that.&#8221; I had chosen it almost at random. It had the best per-dose price and was listed as a top seller.</p>
<p>In retrospect, were it not for the pain and difficulty experienced by my son, it would be funny how the answer was under my nose the whole time. I was slow to appreciate it because of my own prejudice and not treating the problem as something to scientifically test. I thought of omega-3 as being for heart health. I&#8217;d never seen it mentioned in relation to emotional health or brain development, outside of the usual bromides about eating walnuts and so forth. Plus the recommendations are always couched in generalities without specific dosage guidelines. Even after I discovered it made a difference for my pregnant wife, it didn&#8217;t occur to me to test it seriously on my son. Their symptoms and nutritional needs seemed unrelated.</p>
<p>A few weeks later we saw the professional who had tested our son to go over the results. A few weeks had passed between the evaluation and when we met to discuss the results; it was during that time that I made the omega-3 discovery. I told the professional that our son was getting really good results from the omega-3 supplement. I said that after noticing his results I&#8217;d done some online searching and there were a few scientific studies supporting the use of omega-3 supplements for ADHD. The professional said he was aware of the studies, but the efficacy wasn&#8217;t as certain or as strong compared to the prescription drugs so most people choose the prescriptions. (He sent me the same Bloch &#038; Qawasmi paper Seth linked to in his April 21 Assorted Links.) I wondered if most people were even made aware of the possibility of omega-3 deficiency &#8212; he certainly didn&#8217;t bring it up with us. I would not have found the research papers without first knowing what to look for. I knew what to look for only because of  the discovery I made with my son.</p>
<p>The omega-3 supplement, while a huge improvement, was not an immediate cure. We started giving him two capsules daily which consisted of 800 mg EPA and 400 mg DHA. That seemed to me a lot of omega-3, relative to what one could consume through normal dietary intake. </p>
<p>I was not overly comfortable with that level of dose long-term despite it clearly working. So every couple months or so I&#8217;d have him skip a day or whole weekend. Without fail, his mood noticeably worsened. By the early evening he would be overwhelmed and frustrated to the point of tears by little things that weren&#8217;t going his way, things that were really just the usual complications of life in a household with two parents and two siblings. </p>
<p>A poignant instance of the effects of missing a dose happened in the Fall of the following school year, still 2012. My wife&#8217;s mother came for a visit. The break from routine caused my wife to forget to give our son his omega-3 supplement for three or four days in a row. He might have had them on Sunday, but not on any of the weekdays. By Thursday I had gotten a note and phone call from his teacher about his behavior at school. We had to go and meet with her the following week. At the meeting I shared that we had forgotten to give him the omega-3 capsules due to his grandmother visiting. I saw this as proof it was working. The teacher didn&#8217;t know we had forgotten, and yet his behavior had noticeably regressed. She did not share my awe, and tried to imply that he should be on a prescription. I said that kids can forget prescriptions just as easily and the side effects from a missed prescription are going to be far worse than three days off an omega-3 supplement.</p>
<p>Last month we again ran out of the omega-3 supplement. Except for the accidental occurrence when my wife&#8217;s mother was visiting, this is the first time he&#8217;s been off it for more than a few consecutive days in the two years and two months since I first discovered it helped him. I&#8217;m quite pleased that he seems to be doing OK. There&#8217;s been virtually no difference in his behavior since stopping. However, it&#8217;s not a true cold-turkey quit. We have some of the Green Pastures FCLO infused coconut oil, so he&#8217;s been taking that instead. The manufacturer is vague about its omega-3 content, but my rough estimate is that he&#8217;s taking, a third to a half of his previous dose with the Mega-EPA capsules. Then again, it&#8217;s in the triglyceride form which is supposed to be 50-70% better absorbed on a per-gram basis. Perhaps it&#8217;s a wash. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought about having him try flax oil. There is considerable debate about the efficacy of flax oil and the body&#8217;s ability to synthesize EPA and DHA from ALA, the omega-3 in flax oil. It might be a little late to test efficacy now. The best time to test was one and two years ago when the Mega-EPA supplement was clearly working and had an “efficacy&#8221; half-life of 24 hours. The thought never occurred to me until recently when reading Seth&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t end without sharing some of my frustrations with the state of health science. There is no doubt in my mind that omega-3 helped both my son and my wife deal with some severe and yet common mental health problems. I&#8217;m a pretty sharp, pretty well-read guy that&#8217;s always had an interest in biology and medicine. Outside of a few esoteric corners of the web where you have to know what you&#8217;re looking for in order to find it, omega-3 is something you take for heart health. </p>
<p>I think the comparison with statins is apt. When “heart-healthy whole-grains” don&#8217;t fix one&#8217;s blood makers, and why would they, it&#8217;s very quickly on to prescription drugs (statins). When “use your words” doesn&#8217;t fix a young boy&#8217;s interactions with classmates and teachers, and why would it, it&#8217;s on to prescription drugs. Boys especially are put on incredibly strong pharmaceuticals with well-established risk factors that include stunted growth and suicide. Pharmaceuticals should be tried last, but they are clearly being tried first by frustrated parents and suspect practitioners. It&#8217;s a national shame and a personal outrage.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Allan Folz</h4>
<p>My wife had moderately severe postpartum depression (PPD) after the birth of our first child, a boy, in 2004. The depression lifted at the same time the nursing stopped, when he was about two years old. The pregnancy itself was without major or even minor problems so the depression was a big surprise. It was frustrating because nothing we did to alleviate it actually helped.<span id="more-13514"></span></p>
<p>With our second child, born in 2007, for the whole pregnancy we were worried she would experience it again. Thankfully she did not. There were a couple of differences between the two pregnancies. Our first baby was a boy and born with a complication during delivery. The placenta did not release. This caused to be transferred to a hospital, as it was a home birth. At the hospital she was given two units of whole blood. Our second baby was a girl, also born at home, and this time with no issues.</p>
<p>Her third pregnancy was in 2010 and this is where the story begins.</p>
<p>A couple months before she became pregnant, I had discovered paleo dieting following a link to <a href="http://freetheanimal.com/" target="_blank">Richard Nikoley&#8217;s blog</a>. I read about his experience and followed links to other sites in the paleosphere. The diet, the rationale behind it, and the numerous reports of other people having their health remarkably improved by it really resonated with me, so we adopted a lower-carb, paleo-style diet.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t have health problems that we were trying to correct for ourselves or a particular need to lose weight, outside of a few pounds for my wife relative to how much she weighed prior to her first pregnancy some six years before. However, I&#8217;ve always had an interest in health, medicine, and how the body functions. I even considered becoming an M.D. back in my undergrad days and minored in biology alongside my major in electrical engineering. I have a strong skepticism towards experts and what is the conventional wisdom in mainstream media sources. I think that&#8217;s why I almost immediately found Seth&#8217;s blog so intriguing, he questions the conventional wisdom and pushes people to take personal responsibility over their health and well-being. So, we were on a low to moderate carb diet, but weren&#8217;t fanatical about it. I remember that after my wife&#8217;s first visit with her midwives they were concerned by the ketones in her urine and strongly suggested she start eating more complex carbs. She followed their advice to be conservative. We were also supplementing Vitamin D and a little fish oil (a Mega-EPA omega-3 supplement). She was averaging 5K IU of Vitamin D a day, but only about one, 1 gram capsule once or twice a week of the fish oil. All in all, not much fish oil as I wasn&#8217;t sure how much was really necessary for people otherwise eating traditionally healthy, home-cooked meals, and I&#8217;m very skeptical of the diet supplement industry.</p>
<p>Late in the third trimester she started experiencing some moodiness. By itself, it probably would not have seemed atypical for a woman in her third trimester, but with my wife’s history we were far more sensitive to it and quick to take notice. Paying close attention (and long before discovering Seth&#8217;s blogging on self-experimentation), I eventually realized the moodiness happened when we’d skipped taking fish oils mid-week. If she didn’t take any mid-week, by Saturday it was very noticeable that her mood was on the short-tempered side. Once I noticed the connection, and without telling her what I was doing (i.e. single-blind), I’d deliberately skip the mid-week dose one week and note her weekend temper and mood. The following week I’d be sure she took a capsule mid-week. Next week back to skipping. Then, just to be sure, I had her double-dose one week. The double-dose had her in the best mood of all.</p>
<p>At first I was amazed. It was so neat, so mechanical &#8212; like flipping a switch. But it occurred to me that if two capsules in a week vs. one was enough to noticeably change her mood then she was obviously deficient as every mg was being put to use with no spare capacity in her system. I wondered if her body was scavenging omega-3 from her own brain for the developing fetus. That was a sobering thought. After that she went to supplementing daily and had no mood issues throughout the rest of the pregnancy or while breast feeding. She did have some of the typical “baby blues” that set in at the three day mark, but they did not last long. Also, she had good days and bad days, like anyone would. I&#8217;d say the omega-3 returned her to her normal bearing, irrespective of the demands of pregnancy and nursing.</p>
<p>There is zero doubt in my mind that omega 3 helped both my wife deal with a severe and yet all too stereotypical mental health problem. I&#8217;m a pretty sharp, pretty well-read guy who&#8217;s always had an interest in biology and medicine. After the experience with our son&#8217;s weaning, I wondered if nursing could cause or complicate PPD. </p>
<p>Seven years ago, when my wife was pregnant for the second time, I had searched the web for material related to those two (nursing and PPD) and came up empty-handed. I know I&#8217;ve never read something dealing with those two in mainstream outlets because it&#8217;s the type of thing I would mentally file away for future reference if the situation ever came up. It seemed like I was the only one willing to consider there might be a connection between them. Diet suggestions for nursing mothers are full of the usual bromides about getting enough complex carbs, fiber, and protein. Search engine auto-completes on “postpartum depression” don&#8217;t offer “omega-3” or “diet” anywhere in the top 10. You have to type the first two letters of each before they pop-up as auto-complete options. Today, the first hit for “postpartum depression diet” (I use Bing) is http://www.postpartum-living.com/depression-diet.html, which makes absolutely no mention of fats or lipids. It mentions vitamins, of course, but, incredibly, nothing specific.</p>
<p>During the two years my wife had PPD after her first pregnancy, no one suggested omega-3. At the time, I attributed her PPD to the delivery complications and the blood transfusion. I knew that depression is well-known among heart-attack survivors and IVF recipients, and, in my opinion, IVF is a pretty severe complication. Among the health professionals she saw about her PPD, the only thing the MD did was give her a prescription for Prozac or something similar, which she didn&#8217;t use because, well, of course &#8212; she was nursing. Had she quit nursing to take the prescription we would have attributed the improvement to the drug when it actually came from ceasing nursing. The naturopathic practitioners &#8212; she saw two different ones &#8212; gave her B-12 shots, SAM-e, melatonin, and a bunch of useless diet advice that one could read at all the usual places. The B-12 was good for a 24-48 hour energy boost. Other than that, none of them made the slightest difference.</p>
<p><i>Part 2, about using omega-3 to treat ADHD, will appear tomorrow. Allan Folz is a software developer in Portland, Oregon. He recently co-founded <a href="http://www.EdisonGauss.com" target="_blank">Edison Gauss Publishing</a>, a software house that makes academically rigorous educational apps for children in grades K-8.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I learned from a Crest ad that a large fraction of pregnant women, such as half, suffer from gingivitis (inflamed gums). It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.oralb.com/topics/gingivitis-during-pregnancy.aspx" target="_blank">pregnancy gingivitis</a>. The ad recommended better dental hygiene, such as brushing your teeth more.</p>
<p>Thirty years from now will people think <i>how could they</i> [meaning us] <em>have</em><i> been that stupid?</i> Faced with pregnancy gingivitis, they <em>brushed their teeth more? </em>Pregnancy gingivitis is supposedly due to &#8220;hormones&#8221; that increase during pregnancy. In other words, a health expert actually thinks &#8212; or claims to think &#8212; that pregnancy gingivitis has a different explanation than other gingivitis. Yet he doesn&#8217;t know what causes other gingivitis. For example, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gingivitis/basics/causes/con-20021422" target="_blank">here</a> is what Mayo Clinic experts say causes gingivitis. This makes no sense. But it is worse than most nonsense, since fetal health is at stake.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I greatly increased my flaxseed intake because I discovered it improved my balance. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-and-gum-health/" target="_blank">My gums suddenly went from red (inflamed) to pink (not inflamed)</a>, no doubt because flaxseed has lots of omega-3, which is anti-inflammatory. Gingivitis is &#8212; usually? always? &#8212; caused by too little omega-3.</p>
<p>My theory: pregnancy gingivitis happens because pregnant women need more omega-3 than usual. A growing brain needs lots of omega-3.  If this theory turns out to be true, the gums of pregnant women should be monitored to make sure they are getting enough omega-3. Nowadays pregnant women are given omega-3 to take but there is no test to make sure it is enough. That pregnancy gingivitis is common suggests it often isn&#8217;t enough. Actually, everyone&#8217;s gums should be checked to make sure they are getting enough omega-3.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Vitamin D and Cholesterol: The Importance of the Sun</em> (2009) by David Grimes, an excellent book, I came across <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1632514/" target="_blank">a 1977 study of healthy middle-aged men</a>. The researchers measured their diet and watched them from 1966 to 1976. The question: What diets were associated with better health? There turned out to be associations with cholesterol (lower better) and systolic blood pressure (lower better), but these were less interesting than two strong dietary associations. One was between energy intake and heart disease. Men in the lowest third of energy intake had 23 cases of heart disease; men in the highest third had 7 cases. That&#8217;s probably due to exercise: the more you exercise the more you eat. We already know exercise is good.</p>
<p>The other association was with cereal fiber. Men in the lowest third of consumption (2-7 g/day) had 25 cases of heart disease; men in the highest third (8-34 g/day) had 5 cases. (A Wasa cracker has about 2 g cereal fiber.) You might dismiss this as healthy-person bias: healthy people do many healthy things, such as eat fiber. However, there was no association of heart disease and fiber from fruit and nuts. They&#8217;re healthy too. &#8220;The advantage of a diet high in cereal fibre cannot be explained [by us],&#8221; said the authors.</p>
<p>Later studies have found the same thing. For example, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16441941" target="_blank">a 2006 review</a> reached a similar conclusion: &#8220;There is an increasing body of evidence, including that from prospective population studies and epidemiological observational studies, suggesting a strong inverse relationship between increased consumption of wholegrain foods and reduced risk of CVD.&#8221; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6291372" target="_blank">A study of health-conscious people</a> &#8212; to reduce healthy-person bias &#8212; found a similar association: &#8220;Persons who habitually ate wholemeal bread had a lower mortality from cerebrovascular disease.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v56/n1/full/1601283a.html" target="_blank">A 2002 review</a> and <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6879" target="_blank">a 2013 review</a> provide even more evidence for the association.</p>
<p><a href="mrheisenbug.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Shant Mesrobian</a> has emphasized the importance of fiber for health. Whereas paleo gurus usually say grains are bad. <a href="http://www.eat-real-food-paleodietitian.com/Paleo-diet-reasons-to-avoid-grains.html" target="_blank">Here</a>, for example, are &#8220;10 reasons to avoid grains&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-25-bad-restaurant-maybe.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13110" alt="2014-02-25 bad restaurant maybe" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-25-bad-restaurant-maybe-591x300.jpeg" width="591" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This graph shows recent results from the test I used to track my brain function. The test is a choice reaction task done on my laptop: see a digit (e.g.,&#8221;2&#8243;), press the corresponding key as fast as possible. The <em>x</em> axis shows the time of the test. The ticks (&#8220;Sat&#8221;, etc.) mark the beginning of the associated days. The <em>y</em> axis shows the average percentile of the reaction times. Higher percentile = faster. (Let me explain what &#8220;percentile&#8221; means: Each reaction time is compared to earlier reaction times with the same stimulus, and its percentile is computed. For example, a percentile of 60 means that 60% of previous responses were slower.) An average of 60 is quite good and 40 is quite bad. I usually do two tests per day, one right after the other, in the late afternoon (e.g., 4:30 pm).<span id="more-13109"></span></p>
<p>On Friday and Saturday, my scores were close to normal. On Sunday afternoon, however, my scores were much worse than usual; the average score was about 15. A score that low might happen once per year. The next day (Monday) I tested more often than usual &#8212; both morning and afternoon &#8212; and my scores gradually returned to normal. On Tuesday I also tested both morning and afternoon. My scores were ordinary the whole time. This showed that the improvement Monday morning was not normal.</p>
<p>What happened Sunday? I am pretty sure the problem is my lunch at a middle-cost noodle restaurant whose English name is <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294212-d5482531-Reviews-Flying_Noodle-Beijing.html" target="_blank">Flying Noodle</a>. It is close to the Tsinghua campus but I&#8217;d only been there once before (and eaten almost nothing that time). On Sunday I had a small pickled vegetable dish and an ordinary-sized plate of fried eggs and tomatoes. I suspect the problem is the oil used to cook the egg and tomato. It might have been soybean, corn, sunflower or peanut oil, all high in omega-6. (There are also complaints about reuse of cooking oil.) As I entered the restaurant, I worried about the oil, but also thought <i>who really knows? </i>By the time of my brain test, I had forgotten my concern.</p>
<p>A friend was with me. She ate different dishes. She found that her scores on a iPhone game she often plays, which requires fast reactions, were suddenly and mysteriously worse after the lunch. Then, in about a day, they recovered.</p>
<p>This interests me in several ways:</p>
<p>1. <strong>New phenomenology</strong>. In this example and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">my earlier tofu results</a> (a piece of fermented tofu reduced my brain score for two days), I noticed something never noticed before: Sharp changes (bad) in brain function. Fortunately I quickly recovered. Nobody knew this happened. It&#8217;s like looking through a microscope or telescope for the first time, but with much more relevance to everyday concerns. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Comparison with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me" target="_blank"><i>Super Size Me</i></a></strong>, a 2004 documentary by Morgan Spurlock, which argued that McDonald&#8217;s food was unhealthy. Spurlock ate only McDonald&#8217;s food for 30 days. Realism: Spurlock ate far more McDonald&#8217;s food than anyone would normally eat; I ate one meal. Information value: Spurlock&#8217;s test was so unrealistic and his diet so plainly unhealthy that I doubt the results &#8212; Spurlock&#8217;s health got worse, he gained weight &#8212; have any implications for the rest of us. In contrast, I find my results horrifying. Bias: Spurlock was obviously biased against McDonald&#8217;s before he started. I thought favorably of the Flying Noodle &#8212; that&#8217;s why I went there. Cost: My data cost essentially nothing, Spurlock&#8217;s movie <a href="http://www.filmeducation.org/pdf/film/SuperSizeMe.pdf" target="_blank">cost $65,000</a>, not to mention the damage to Spurlock&#8217;s health. Recovery time: Spurlock took 14 months to lose the weight he gained. I recovered in a day. Repeatability: My test is easy to repeat, Spurlock&#8217;s very difficult.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Public health disaster?</strong> China has a very high rate of diabetes, for unknown reasons. Chinese teenagers and college students have much worse (inflamed) skin than I see in other countries. Old people in China look much worse than old people in Japan. Could heavy use of high-omega-6 cooking oil be a big reason? </p>
<p>4. <strong>Where were authorities?</strong> We expect our government &#8212; in combination with academia &#8212; to protect us against dangerous chemicals in our environment. If I&#8217;m right about the cause of my low score, that didn&#8217;t happen here. Cooking oil is the opposite of a rare food. If ordinary amounts of a common cooking oil did cause these results, it suggests something is seriously wrong with the regulatory system. A big argument for personal science &#8212; and brain tracking in particular &#8212; is that you monitor exactly the environment to which you are exposed in exactly the genetic context you care about (yours).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://s919.photobucket.com/user/twoutopias/media/2i014-01-10berkeleyvsbeijingreactiontime_zps221e5bf7.jpeg.html" target="_blank"><img alt=" photo 2i014-01-10berkeleyvsbeijingreactiontime_zps221e5bf7.jpeg" src="http://i919.photobucket.com/albums/ad40/twoutopias/2i014-01-10berkeleyvsbeijingreactiontime_zps221e5bf7.jpeg" border="0" /></a> This graph shows my brain test reaction times over roughly one year. Each point is a different test; I usually do two tests per day back to back. I assume faster = better. In February 2013 I returned to Berkeley from Beijing. In August 2013 I went back to Beijing. When I returned to Berkeley, my scores got worse (slower). I was shocked. <em>Surely Berkeley is healthier than Beijing</em>. At first I thought it was jet lag, but the scores stayed worse long after that made sense. Then I thought it might be some difference in diet, even though I eat similar food in the two places. I tried to make my Berkeley diet closer to my Beijing diet. This might have helped. I noticed accidentally that chocolate improved my score and started eating chocolate frequently. This artificially reduced the difference since in Beijing I had not been eating chocolate. In Berkeley I started doing two things I hadn&#8217;t done in Beijing: alternate-day fasting and whole-body vibration. I don&#8217;t know if they made a difference. When I returned to Beijing in September, my scores got better, even though I was not eating chocolate. Eventually I improved my sleep in Beijing but that seemed to make little difference. The comparison is far from perfect &#8212; many things varied &#8212; but by and large my scores got worse when I went from Beijing to Berkeley and improved when I went from Berkeley to Beijing. </p>
<p>What might have caused this? There are a hundred possibilities but one stands out. In both places, I brew and drink several cups of tea every day. In Beijing, everyone, including me, drinks water from big plastic bottles that are delivered to your house. You can choose pure water or &#8220;mineral&#8221; water, which has  added magnesium and potassium. In Berkeley I use tap water (Brita filtered). I don&#8217;t think potassium affects brain function &#8212; for example, eating bananas makes no difference &#8212; but there is <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/testing-magnesium-s-brain-boosting-effects-1.11665" target="_blank">plenty of evidence that magnesium improves brain function</a>. In Beijing I had tested a magnesium supplement and found no effect, consistent with the idea that I was already getting enough. Magnesium is also believed to improve sleep. In Beijing I seemed to sleep better than in Berkeley. Again, this is consistent with a difference in magnesium levels (more in Beijing). If ordinary magnesium-enriched water improves brain function, it would be significant because it is so easy, in contrast to <a href="http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2012/feb2012_Novel-Magnesium-Compound-Reverses-Neurodegeneration_01.htm" target="_blank">other ways of increasing magnesium levels</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six years ago I started using a reaction-time (RT) test (a test where you press a key in response to something as fast as possible) to track my brain function. I took the test daily. It must use only a small part of the brain but I assumed that something that made me faster would probably improve overall brain function. Behind this belief, which I call <strong>better RT, better brain</strong>, were countless studies of brain anatomy and physiology, which had shown that neurons and glial cells all over the brain share many features. Cells in different parts of the brain are much more alike than different. More support for this assumption was that <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">certain doses of flaxseed oil improved both RT and other measures of brain function</a>, such as balance.</p>
<p>I also assumed that changes that improved RT would probably improve overall health &#8212; what I call the<strong> better RT, better body</strong> assumption. It was less plausible than the <strong>better RT, better brain </strong>assumption because the cells in different organs of the body differ so much. They have many similarities but also many differences. I believed it for two reasons. (a) Flaxseed oil not only improved several measures of brain function, it improved my gums, no doubt because it reduced inflammation. It had been far from obvious that improving gums was so easy or that flaxseed oil (in the right dosage) would do so. The assumption <strong>better RT, better body</strong> had made a surprising prediction, you could say, that turned out to be true. (b) The brain gets much the same blood as the rest of the body. (Not exactly the same, because of the blood-brain barrier.) In the same way, all plug-in electrical appliances use the same house current. Just as all appliances have been designed to work well with that current, all our organs should have been shaped by evolution to work well with same mix of nutrients. You can&#8217;t feed your brain differently than your heart.</p>
<p>When I discovered that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">butter improved RT</a>, the <strong>better RT, better body</strong> assumption made a second even more surprising prediction: Eating more butter improved my health. This contradicted the claims of all mainstream health experts, who say saturated fats cause heart disease. I stuck with my assumption &#8212; I still eat a lot of butter. The data I&#8217;ve seen since then has supported my conclusion. For example, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/28/new-heart-scan-results-good-news/" target="_blank">my Agatston score got better</a>, not worse, after a year of eating lots of butter. The Agatston score is currently <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health-pictures/the-single-best-predictor-of-a-heart-attack.aspx#/slide-1" target="_blank">the best predictor of heart disease</a>.</p>
<p>I recently found more support for the <strong>better RT, better body </strong>assumption. Several studies have found that RT is a good predictor of health (better RT, better health). Even more impressive, it is a better predictor than many of the predictors we already know of. The RT test used in these studies is close to the test I now use, which I developed independently. The RT test in these studies involves showing a digit (0-4), after which the subject presses one of five keys (labelled 0-4) as fast as possible. My current RT test is very similar but uses 7 digits instead of 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15660853" target="_blank">A 2005 study</a> looked at the oft-reported correlation between higher IQ and lower mortality. The IQs and RTs of about 900 persons were measured in 1988. Deaths until 2002 were noted. RT was associated with lower mortality, even after taking out associations with smoking, education and social class. RT and IQ are correlated (better RT, higher IQ). When the RT-death association was removed, IQ no longer predicted death. So RT does a good job of capturing whatever it is about IQ that predicts mortality.</p>
<p><a href="http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/7.-Reaction-time-and-established-risk-factors-for-total-and-cardiovascular-disease-mortality.pdf" target="_blank">A 2009 study</a> compared RT to more conventional health predictors (&#8220;risk factors&#8221;). About 7,000 subjects were followed from 1984 to 2005. RT in 1984 was a good predictor of all-cause mortality compared to classic risk factors. Smoking was by far the best predictor, followed by RT. RT was a better predictor than physical activity, blood pressure, a questionnaire measuring &#8220;psychological distress&#8221;, resting heart rate, waist/hip ratio, alcohol intake, and body mass index.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17846257" target="_blank">A third study</a>, based on the same subjects as the 2009 study, found that amount of <em>decline</em> (slowing) in RT (from one test to a second test seven years later) predicted death. People with more decline were more likely to die.</p>
<p>All this supports studying how your RT is controlled by your environment, especially what you eat. You have to choose wisely what to study. The point is not to be as fast as possible regardless of everything else. Lots of drugs (stimulants, such as caffeine) decrease RT for short periods of time. I doubt they improve health. (If they harm sleep, they probably worsen health.) What makes sense is to look for two things: 1. <strong>Poisons</strong>. Things that slow you down. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">I discovered that tofu did so</a>. I gave several reasons for thinking that tofu affects many people this way, not just me. Billions of people eat tofu, unaware of this possibility. 2. <strong>Deficiencies</strong>. Study things that are missing from your life now but were likely to be present when we evolved. It is quite plausible that our ancient ancestors ate more omega-3 (in fish, but also in flaxseed) and more animal fat (from big animals, but also in butter) than we do now. My data suggest omega-3 and animal fat are nutrients necessary for health whose importance mainstream nutrition researchers have not fully appreciated.</p>
<p>My RT data have shown me there&#8217;s a lot I didn&#8217;t/don&#8217;t know about how my food affects me. Maybe everyone can say that. Unlike almost anyone else, however, I can reduce my ignorance myself. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/27/lessons-of-this-blog-2nd-of-2/">I don&#8217;t need to rely on experts</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I posted that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">tofu made me stupid</a> &#8212; made me slower on a reaction-time test &#8212; a reader named Ann, who lives in Florida, said she had discovered that her migraine headaches were caused by soy. How she discovered this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was 49 years old and in that hot flashes stage of life, had read that soy could help alleviate them and tried a soy capsule not at a meal, immediately noticed sinus pressure and itchiness.</p>
<p>So I started reading all labels and eliminated soy from my diet and my migraines and sinus headaches went away! The hot flashes eventually went away on their own. I was losing whole days every month to the migraines. Every now and then the soy sneaks in at a restaurant but not as bad as before. Whenever anyone says they have migraines I always suggest looking at soy. Regretfully my daughter has the same issue, but she has way fewer headaches after eliminating soy.</p>
<p>I used to blame a lot of my headaches on allergies, never thinking it could be something I was eating. At age 60 now, my cholesterol numbers are excellent and I weigh 122 pounds when so many of my friends are overweight.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked how long it had taken to discover this.</p>
<blockquote><p>I had been having migraines for years, 10-20, but in the mid 90s they got worse (could have coincided with more soy in food).  Saw a doctor but he just prescribed imitrex which helped but did not prevent them. He never suggested looking for a food cause. It was dumb luck or divine intervention that I tried that soy capsule in 2001 or 2002. I am often amazed at how much better I feel health wise since then. Since soy is in so much processed food my diet is very basic &#8220;real&#8221; food. Raw fruits and veggies, plain nuts, fresh meat, real cheese, eggs, yogurt, any desserts I make from scratch with real butter. I&#8217;m always excited when I find a cracker that doesn&#8217;t have soy since that&#8217;s usually my bread substitute.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me repeat part of that: A doctor she saw because of migrains did not suggest trying to find an environmental cause. The same thing happened to <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html" target="_blank">a woman I wrote about for Boing Boing</a>. Her doctor just prescribed one drug after another. Her migraines turned out to be caused by cleaning products. Not knowing that migraines often have environmental causes is like not knowing the germ theory of disease. </p>
<p>Few soy eaters realize the dangers of soy, as far as I can tell. I wrote to one of them, <a href="http://www.theveganrd.com/about" target="_blank">Virginia Messina</a>, a nutritionist who has said &#8220;there is no reason to believe that eating soyfoods is harmful to brain aging.&#8221; She has not replied.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://uhs.berkeley.edu/home/healthtopics/pdf/triggers.pdf" target="_blank">long list of possible migraine triggers</a> (from the UC Berkeley health service) does <strong>not</strong> list soy, although it does mention soy sauce. It says soy milk should be safe. In a 2006 interview,  <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5364970" target="_blank">one headache doctor</a> recommended avoiding all soy. In the comments to <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/01/24/migraine-triggers-may-not-be-so-potent-after-all/" target="_blank">this</a>, a woman says:</p>
<blockquote><p>SOY is the biggest trigger for my migraines.  For years I suffered daily from migraines but after watching EVERYTHING I eat and reading all labels and avoiding SOY as best I can I am doing better.  The biggest problem is that SOY is in everything!!!!  I think one day they will find out how bad it is for us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine that. Putting something that damages the brain in everything.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been testing my brain function daily for the last six years. I use a reaction-time test (see digit, type digit as fast as possible) that takes about five minutes. I have gradually improved the test over the years &#8212; this is about version 8. One reason for this testing is that I might observe a sudden change. That could suggest a new factor that affects brain function &#8212; whatever was unusual before the change (e.g., a new food). This is how I discovered <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/" target="_blank">the effect of butter</a>. My score suddenly improved, I investigated. Another sudden change (improvement) happened soon after I switched from Chinese flaxseed oil to American flaxseed oil. I hadn&#8217;t realized that something was wrong with the Chinese flaxseed oil. I started brain tracking after I noticed a sudden improvement in balance the morning after I swallowed about five flaxseed oil capsules. Millions of people had taken flaxseed oil capsules, but no one, it seemed, had noticed the balance improvement. <em>Maybe other big changes in brain function go unnoticed</em>, I thought.</p>
<p><span id="more-12281"></span></p>
<p>A month ago, my score suddenly got worse (= I became slower). There was one unusual thing that day, before the test: I had eaten a piece of <em>bai fu ru</em>, a kind of fermented tofu popular in China. <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/09/chichis-chinese-fermented-bean-curd.html" target="_blank">To make it</a>, &#8220;cubes of tofu are first fermented, then soaked in brines that contain a number of ingredients: rice wine, vinegar, chili peppers, cinnamon, star anise, and red yeast rice, the last which imparts the deep red hue that you&#8217;ll see in certain varieties.&#8221; <a href="http://www.kcet.org/living/food/the-nosh/have-you-eaten/4-ways-to-enjoy-stinky-tofu-in-los-angeles.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a discussion of fermented tofu in Los Angeles. It&#8217;s popular in China. Most people use it as a condiment, but I ate small amounts (one cube)  alone.</p>
<p>To find out if the <em>bai fu ru</em> caused the worsening, I did a test. I deliberately ate one 20 g cube at 11 am. I do the brain tests in the afternoon, usually 4-5 pm. What happen to my brain score that day? Here are the results.</p>
<p><a href="http://s919.photobucket.com/user/twoutopias/media/2013-12-01tofuslowsdownbraintofuplot_zpsceffdd58.jpeg.html" target="_blank"><img alt=" photo 2013-12-01tofuslowsdownbraintofuplot_zpsceffdd58.jpeg" src="http://i919.photobucket.com/albums/ad40/twoutopias/2013-12-01tofuslowsdownbraintofuplot_zpsceffdd58.jpeg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Each point is a different test. I conclude that the tofu slowed me down by about 20 ms and the effect lasted two days. I didn&#8217;t notice the change in other ways &#8212; I didn&#8217;t feel tired or slow, for example. Presumably that is why this has gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>I think these results reflect cause and effect for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Clarity</strong>. A <em>t</em> value would be very large.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Surprising prediction</strong>. A surprising prediction turned out to be true. Sharp drops like this are rare. Perhaps they happen once every 3-6 months.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Repetition</strong>. A research assistant found similar results, although not as clear. She is Chinese &#8212; quite different genetically.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Other evidence that tofu is bad for the brain</strong>. After I found these results, I remembered <a href="http://www.healthmegamall.com/Articles/BabeskinArticle260.pdf" target="_blank">an old study</a>. It found an association between midlife tofu consumption and late life cognitive decline among Japanese-American men in Hawaii (more tofu, more decline). <a href="http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/soy-online-service/Brain.htm#.UpVOQcRQKm4" target="_blank">A related study</a> of the same men found a correlation between cognitive decline and miso consumption. <a href="http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/141484" target="_blank">A later study of Indonesian men and women</a> also found a correlation between tofu consumption and cognitive decline (more tofu, more decline). The same study also found a <em>beneficial</em> weak correlation between tempeh consumption and cognitive decline (more tempeh, less decline). A weak epidemiological association found only once means little &#8212; epidemiologists, in my experience, do not adjust for the number of tests done and usually ignore the problem.  More recently, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23034522" target="_blank">an experiment using a mouse model of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</a> found that a high-soy diet made brain function worse.</p>
<p>Because of the other evidence, I conclude that all tofu (and other soybean foods, such as soy milk) probably impair brain function, not just this version, which contains slightly more than tofu. The other evidence involves lots of non-fermented tofu. Because of the other evidence and my assistant&#8217;s results, I believe these results will be true for other people.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t explain the effect. Tofu is high in omega-6, but the amount of omega-6 in 20 g of tofu is small. Others think that tofu impair brain function due to its isoflavones.</p>
<p>Most nutrition experts say tofu is good for you. Catherine Newman, in <em>O Magazine</em>, <a href="http://www.oprah.com/health/The-Health-Benefits-of-Tofu-and-Soy-Products" target="_blank">raves about it</a>. &#8220;In addition to being wonderfully inexpensive, tofu is high in protein, low in fat, and very low in saturated fat. . . .  One daily four-ounce [= 120 g] serving is an excellent addition to a healthy diet.&#8221; <a href="http://w3.newsmax.com/newsletters/mhr/issues/eat1012/mhr_eat1012_29.pdf" target="_blank"><em>The Mind Health Report</em> (October 2012)</a> says tofu is good for the brain. &#8220;For vegetarians, good choices are tofu, beans and eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Better informed experts criticize soy but say <em>fermented</em> soy is good. <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/09/18/soy-can-damage-your-health.aspx" target="_blank">Joseph Mercola</a> wrote,&#8221;For centuries, Asian people have been consuming fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits.&#8221; The <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/" target="_blank">Weston Price Foundation website</a> says a lot about the badness of soy but claims fermented soy is healthy. In an article about why unfermented soy is bad, <a href="http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/170-scientific-reasons-to-lose-the-soy-in-your-diet/" target="_blank">the Healthy Home Economist says</a>, &#8220;Please note that fermented soy in small, condimental amounts as practiced in traditional Asian cultures is fine for those who have healthy thyroid function [as I do -- Seth].&#8221; My 20 g dose was a small, condimental amount. John Robbins, author of <em>The Food Revolution </em>(2001), dismissed the association of tofu and dementia. <a href="http://www.foodrevolution.org/askjohn/52.htm" target="_blank">He argued</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s not all we know. We know, for example, that dementia rates are lower in Asian countries (where soy intake is high) than in western countries. We know that the Japanese lifestyle (with its high soy intake) has long been associated with longer life span and better cognition in old age. And we know that Seventh Day Adventists, many of whom consume soyfoods their whole lives, have less dementia in old age than the general population. . . . A number of clinical studies have shown that soy and isoflavones from soy are actually beneficial for cognition. . . . . Having studied the literature, soy researchers Mark and Virginia Messina conclude that “there is no reason to believe that eating soyfoods is harmful to brain aging.” [Robbins failed to mention that <a href="http://www.vegnutrition.com/about/index.html" target="_blank">Mark and Virginia Messina</a> own a "nutrition consulting company specializing in soyfoods nutrition" -- Seth]</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when the Messinas said this. Maybe there was once &#8220;no reason&#8221; to think soyfoods bad for the brain, but there is now.  The new evidence, epidemiology, and mouse evidence make a good case.</p>
<p>Here are two interesting things. 1. A very popular food is dangerous, maybe harmful. 2. Nutrition experts had claimed the opposite: the food is good for you. Even the better ones (Mercola, Weston Price Foundation) got it wrong, ignoring evidence (the epidemiology). It is a good example of experts overstating their understanding. The Shangri-La Diet is another example (every expert said sugar was fattening, I found it caused me to lose weight).</p>
<p>Even more interesting is the methodological implication. <em>Anyone can do what I did, with any food</em>. It&#8217;s easy, safe, cheap, and takes little time. The bad effects were large enough, and the method sensitive enough, that the bad effects were well above noise. And this is a non-trivial case. Tofu is popular.</p>
<p>We eat thousands of foods. We have millions of genotypes. We eat our food in millions of environments. Your genotype and environment affect how a food will affect you. So a good understanding of how foods affect us would seem to require thousands times millions times millions of tests. It is absurd to assume that anyone else (government, academia, industry) will do the necessary tests. They can&#8217;t <em>begin</em> to do the tests. In contrast to people doing a job (for example, people in government responsible for food safety) <strong>you</strong> have a much simpler problem: <strong>Is my food safe for me? </strong>You only care about one genotype (yours) and one context (yours) and you eat far fewer than thousands of foods. You can do good tests. You can test exactly what you eat in exactly the context you eat it. Compared to the present, where we extrapolate from epidemiology, animal tests, and the rare human experiment, the reduction in uncertainty and increase in generalizability is immense.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">If you want to do experiments like this &#8212; test foods one by one &#8212; with my software (which requires Windows), please contact me. The tests require a training period of 1-2 months so that the scores during an experiment are roughly constant.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://stuartkingmusic.com/" target="_blank">Stuart King</a>, an Australian musician in his thirties, recently <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/11/association-of-sleep-and-chronic-illness/#comment-1150683" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most days I wake up feeling more tired than when I went to bed the night before, however I find that if I take up to a tablespoon [15 ml] of raw honey immediately before bed I almost always wake up feeling totally refreshed. I’ve suffered from low energy, brain fog, fatigue and sore muscles for years. I tried eliminating food groups (dairy, grains, nightshades, etc) but that didn’t fix the problems (although wheat has been problematic) but taking the honey did. I usually sleep without any problems that I’m aware of &#8212; even if I awaken feeling unrefreshed I will still sleep through the night and won’t awaken early or whatever, but the crucial thing is I feel rested when I wake up, if I get that right I can even eat bad food and feel good all day. I tried coconut oil and coconut oil combined with honey but they didn’t work.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t heard that before. I searched &#8220;health benefits of honey&#8221; but didn&#8217;t find it.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_honey" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry about the health benefits of honey</a> doesn&#8217;t mention it. In China, many people think honey is a health food, yet a Chinese friend of mine, who eats honey daily, hadn&#8217;t heard this. The uses of honey in Traditional Chinese Medicine <a href="http://chineseacupuncturehealing.com/2012/07/chinese-medicine-uses-honey-in-herbal-medicine/" target="_blank">lie elsewhere</a>. Honey as sleep aid is briefly mentioned (with a question mark: &#8220;Key to a restful night&#8217;s sleep?&#8221;) in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Honey-Prescription-Amazing-Medicine/dp/1594773467" target="_blank">The Honey Prescription</a> </em>(2010).</p>
<p>Many say or assume something quite different. According to <a  href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/10/02/secrets-to-a-good-night-sleep.aspx" target="_blank">Dr. Mercola</a>, to sleep well &#8220;avoid before-bed snacks, particularly grains and sugars&#8221;. <a " href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/best-food-for-sleep-snacks_n_2083752.html" target="_blank">A <em>Huffington Post</em> writer</a> says, &#8220;You already know which edibles to avoid before bedtime &#8212; namely, alcohol, coffee and sugary desserts.&#8221; Honey is half fructose, which UCSF professor of pediatrics <a  href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Robert Lustig calls</a> &#8220;poison&#8221;. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/21/fructose-poison-sugar-industry-pseudoscience" target="_blank">Lustig says</a> fructose is &#8220;one of the most egregious [= worst] components of the western diet, directly contributing to heart disease and diabetes, and associated with cancer and dementia.&#8221;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Yudkin" target="_blank">John Yudkin</a>, a well-known nutrition professor, wrote books about the harm done by sucrose. He considered <a href="http://www.leaflady.org/fructose.htm" target="_blank">fructose even worse</a>. Nutrition researchers rarely study time of day effects. For example, nutritional epidemiologists ask what you&#8217;ve eaten but don&#8217;t ask when.</p>
<p>I found a bit of evidence supporting what Stuart found &#8212; namely, two comments <a href="http://www.amazing-green-tea.com/honey-and-insomnia.html" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just started honey and vinegar hot drink 2 weeks ago. Am amazed at the increased quality of sleep and relief of night time pain. Thought I was imagining it so did not have my drink one night. Didn&#8217;t sleep and was racked with pain again all night. . . [my recipe:]  2 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp honey with 1 cup hot water.</p>
<p>Honey knocks me out and I actually wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and ready for the day&#8211;amazing. I&#8217;ve been using the honey for a few months now. The difference has been &#8220;night and day!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, <a href="http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=571638" target="_blank">a 2007 study</a> found that honey at bedtime was slightly better than no treatment at reducing the symptoms of coughing children. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20618098" target="_blank">A 2010 study</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22869830" target="_blank">a 2012 study</a> found the same thing.</p>
<p>I asked Stuart how he discovered that honey improved his sleep. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I read <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-ferriss/11-tricks-for-perfect-sle_b_2527454.html" target="_blank">something that Tim Ferriss said</a> about having a small snack before bed [Ferriss advises protein and fat, not honey -- Seth], I think he mentioned that unrefreshed sleep was due to low blood sugar. At the time I was doing <a href="http://www.mensfitness.com/nutrition/what-to-eat/carb-backloading-to-get-lean" target="_blank">carb back loading</a> (I&#8217;ve since stopped that as carb restriction gave me problems). I would have a snack before bed but it didn&#8217;t always work. I think the small fructose amount in honey was what helped, starches didn&#8217;t always help. I did some research and came across your blog and Dave Asprey&#8217;s blogs on sleep, <a href="http://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-top-6-ways-to-improve-your-sleep-using-food/" target="_blank">Dave mentioned raw honey</a>. He encouraged people to take MCT oil with the honey to stay ketogenic, I tried coconut oil with the honey instead but it didn&#8217;t work. If anything it made my sleep worse with stomach cramps. I think there is an amount where benefits end, I think anywhere between a teaspoon or a tablespoon is about right. . . . The first time I did it I couldn&#8217;t believe it, I felt so good the next day.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added later:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have noticed that if I eat a lot of sugar during the day (soft drinks, desserts and so forth) then I don&#8217;t feel refreshed [when I wake up] regardless of the honey. Perhaps there&#8217;s something about honey that helps regulate blood sugar. I think it works better on an empty stomach/lightly fasted. So if you had dinner at 7 pm you might not eat anything after and take the honey at 9 or 10. In the past I&#8217;ve had a late dinner then maybe some dessert or fruit in the following hours, then added the honey just after and I don&#8217;t think it worked as well. When I first tried it I used commercially available heated honey and it worked great. I&#8217;ve tried 2 tablespoons, but I don&#8217;t think that worked any better than one and sometimes as little as 1 teaspoon is enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>In summary, three people reported great improvement in sleep from honey at bedtime. Stuart found several other things: 1. If he ate a lot of sugar during the day, the effect went away. 2. Other carbs didn&#8217;t work. 3. An empty stomach was important. 4. Effective doses ranged from 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon.</p>
<p>I believe Stuart has discovered something very important. My belief rests on several things:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Repetition</strong>. I started eating honey (1 tablespoon) at bedtime. My sleep (much better than Stuart&#8217;s to begin with) clearly improved, even with 1 teaspoon. I felt more rested when I awoke and more rested throughout the day. The improvement happened night after night. One evening I didn&#8217;t eat the honey on an empty stomach. The improvement didn&#8217;t happen, just as Stuart would have predicted. I told a friend about it. He took 1 tablespoon at bedtime. His sleep immediately improved by a large amount. He stopped waking up in the middle of the night and stopped needing a nap in the afternoon. Another friend has tried it once (so far). &#8220;When I woke up the next morning,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;I&#8217;d realised I&#8217;d slept all the way through the night without waking up in the early morning (a nice change) but had a terrible case of the jitters (a not-so-nice change).&#8221; A third friend tried it twice. She slept better the first night but not the second. Maybe she failed to eat it on an empty stomach or had too many sweets during the day.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Strength increase</strong>. As soon as I started the honey, I got stronger &#8212; a complete surprise. For years I have done one-legged standing to exhaustion several times per day because <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">it improves my sleep</a>. To reach exhaustion sooner, I stand on one <em>bent</em> leg. Recently I&#8217;ve been doing it four times per day (right leg twice, left leg twice). For a year, I&#8217;ve averaged about 3 minutes to exhaustion. After I started the honey, the length of time until exhaustion quickly increased. Here are the measurements:</p>
<p><a href="http://s919.photobucket.com/user/twoutopias/media/2013-11-02effectofhoneyatbedtimeonone-legstanding_zps41d50272.jpeg.html" target="_blank"><img alt=" photo 2013-11-02effectofhoneyatbedtimeonone-legstanding_zps41d50272.jpeg" src="http://i919.photobucket.com/albums/ad40/twoutopias/2013-11-02effectofhoneyatbedtimeonone-legstanding_zps41d50272.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>Each point is a different day; each is the average of the two durations for the first right and first left leg standing of the day. The 2013 tick marks the start of 2013. Nothing changed except the honey. The strength increase was also clear in other ways. In Beijing, I live on the sixth floor of a walk up. It became noticeably easier to climb the six flights of stairs.</p>
<p>The strength increase astonished me. The dietary change was tiny, did not happen before exercise, and involved a safe widely-available food (in contrast to the drugs athletes use, such as steroids). I believe better sleep increased muscle growth. I predict that taking the honey at other times, such as in the morning, would not have the same effect. My earlier observations that <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">lots of standing</a>  and one-legged standing improve sleep make more plausible causality in the opposite direction: something that improves sleep will increase muscle growth.</p>
<p>When I described my strength increase to Stuart, he replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have noticed that when I do the honey, my weight goes up over the next week or two, perhaps by 400-500 grams [yet] my waist doesn&#8217;t increase (I measure it with a tape measure) even after a few weeks. I also have been sure that I noticed rapid muscular growth around my chest, shoulders and arms, similar to what I have noticed when going hard at the gym after a few months off. I kind of assumed that maybe I had more stored muscle glycogen from the honey, but had also considered that improved sleep as you said was the reason.</p></blockquote>
<p>3. <strong>Evolutionary explanation</strong>. It has been a mystery why evolution shaped us to like sweetness so much. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763405802131" target="_blank">Israel Ramirez</a> (whose research led to the Shangri-La Diet) pointed out that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-katz-md/sugar-health-evil-toxic_b_850032.html" target="_blank">the usual explanation</a> (sugar is a  source of energy) makes no sense.  If it&#8217;s because sugars provide energy, why don&#8217;t potatoes and rice taste just as good? They don&#8217;t. Nutritionists lump sugars with other carbohydrates, thereby ignoring the puzzle. No anti-sugar advocate &#8212; not Yudkin, Lustig or anyone else &#8212; has provided a good explanation of why evolution shaped us to like the taste of a &#8220;poison&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are several related puzzles. Why are meals divided into main course and dessert? In other words, why do we eat the sweet part separate and later? If we like sugars because they provide energy, this makes no sense. If sugars are simply carbs, this makes no sense &#8212; we eat plenty of carbs during the main course. The separation of dessert and main course, if it reflects brain mechanisms, must mean that sugars are quite different than other carbs. Somehow we benefit from this division. A few people, in particular Elizabeth Capaldi, an experimental psychologist, have figured out that <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mVtRbgM4T1MC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=elizabeth+capaldi+hunger+sweetness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IVZ2ZIY9UM&amp;sig=w62Vp27qEvqqwyp6H04cSOWp4SY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JpRnUu71GoPs8QTfi4DIDQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=elizabeth%20capaldi%20hunger%20sweetness&amp;f=false" target="_blank">sweet food tastes worse if we are hungry</a> (enough). This is why dessert comes after the rest of the meal. Yet other carbohydrates do not taste worse. Stuart pointed out something else along these lines, which I had not heard before but which is clearly true: We eat dessert much more after dinner than after lunch.</p>
<p>Stuart&#8217;s observations explain these mysteries. All four observations (liking for sweetness, separation of main course and dessert, sweet things taste bad when hungry, dessert after dinner but not lunch) make sense if we have evolved mechanisms to push us to eat sweet foods near bedtime. Long ago, these foods would have mainly been fruit. Because sleep is so important for health, there would be powerful selection for anything that improved sleep.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Basic physiology</strong>. The brain runs on glucose. In my brain tests, sugar drinks, cupcakes, and other sugar-rich foods make an obvious difference 30 minutes to 2 hours later. (I get faster.) And the brain controls sleep, an enormously complicated and time-sensitive process. Too little blood sugar during sleep could easily disrupt sleep.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Basic nutrition</strong>. Honey is half glucose, half fructose. When you eat it, the glucose enters the blood quickly and would supply glucose to the brain in the first half of the night. In contrast, the fructose turns into glucose and enters the blood slowly (fructose has a low glycemic index). This would supply glucose to the brain in the second half of the night. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose" target="_blank">Many fruits, such as bananas, figs, and grapes, have a similar composition (similar amounts of fructose and glucose)</a>. Most fruits have plenty of fructose and glucose.  A 50/50 glucose/fructose mixture makes honey near the start of sleep a good source of blood glucose over an extended period without food. Notice that you need both &#8212; glucose <em>and</em> fructose &#8212; in roughly equal amounts to get a roughly steady supply over six or seven hours.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Basic engineering</strong>. When you are asleep, there can be no &#8220;course correction&#8221;. You must subsist for the next six or so hours without any behavioral help, such as drinking water when thirsty. So it makes design sense to do something shortly before sleep that will provide a relatively steady supply of glucose throughout the night (&#8220;time-release&#8221;). That won&#8217;t be a lot of glucose at once. You need a food that is a mix of sugars.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Support for general idea</strong>. A few weeks ago a woman told me that when she ate very low-carb her sleep suffered, so she ate more carbs and her sleep got better. This supports the general idea behind what Stuart found &#8212; that the brain needs a certain amount of glucose to work well during sleep and it is best if it gets at least some of it from carbohydrate.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Explanation of correlation of sugar and bad health</strong>. Why is sugar consumption often correlated with poor health? This is easy to explain: sugar <em>at the wrong time</em> is the problem. Too much sugar during the day interferes with the bedtime benefit (and may also interfere with sleep in general). Stuart found exactly this: Eating lots of sugary foods during the day disturbed his sleep and eliminated the honey effect (&#8220;if I eat a lot of sugar during the day . . . then I don&#8217;t feel refreshed [when I wake up] regardless of the honey&#8221;). Too much sugar during the day could make it harder to get optimal glucose levels during the night. For example, too much sugar during the day might raise insulin levels, causing too-low blood sugar at night and/or causing a fructose/glucose mixture eaten at bedtime to be digested too quickly. Anything that harms sleep will increase disease. Good health, good sleep and good immune function are closely connected. An example of the evidence is that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16596307" target="_blank">shift workers get more cancer than non-shift workers</a>.</p>
<p>9. <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physics-Rpcc/" target="_blank"><strong>Reichenbach&#8217;s Common Cause Principle</strong></a>, in my paraphrase, is <em>lightning doesn&#8217;t strike twice in one place for different reasons</em>. If two rare events might have the same cause, they probably do. In this case, lightning has struck three times in one place. 1. Huge sleep improvement from tiny dietary change. 2. Huge strength improvement from tiny dietary change far from time of exercise. 3. Evolutionary explanation of why sugars taste good, why dessert exists and follows the main course, and so on. Before this, no one has come close to a plausible evolutionary explanation. The absence of an explanation is remarkable because two of the phenomena &#8212; sweetness tastes good, sweets are eaten separately after the rest of the meal &#8212; are so obvious.</p>
<p>I believe Stuart&#8217;s discovery is important for two other reasons that might not impress anyone else. One is similarities with my earlier work. First, I&#8217;ve found  other &#8220;cross-over&#8221; interactions with time of day, where something helpful at one time is harmful at another time. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/" target="_blank">Vitamin D in the morning improves sleep, Vitamin D at night harms sleep</a>. Morning faces improve mood, evening faces harm mood. Second, wondering why we like sour, umami and complex flavors was the first thing to suggest to me that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/the-unami-hypothesis-why-i-believe-fermented-foods-are-necessary-for-health/" target="_blank">we need to eat plenty of fermented food to be healthy</a>. Many facts later, I&#8217;m sure this is true. Finally, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">evolutionary reasoning</a> has helped me find several new experimental effects (morning faces, Shangri-La Diet, flaxseed oil, standing and sleep).</p>
<p>Finally, Stuart&#8217;s discovery explains something puzzling I&#8217;d noticed repeatedly for years. Now and then I slept unusually well. I&#8217;d wonder why &#8212; how was yesterday different from usual? &#8212; and see that the only unusual thing was that I&#8217;d had dinner at a friend&#8217;s house. At the times, I guessed that seeing faces in the evening was somehow improving my sleep. This did not make sense in terms of my morning faces work, but a connection between social contact and sleep was well-established. Now I realize that dinner at a friend&#8217;s house is one of the few times I eat dessert. A friend told me that when his partner has dinner parties, she serves dessert long after the main course.</p>
<p><a href="https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/downloads/05-027" target="_blank">This report</a> suggests that different honeys may differ in important ways.</p>
<p>I told a Dutch friend about this. She said it was common in Holland to have milk and honey at bedtime, although she herself didn&#8217;t do this. I asked why. <em>No clear reason</em>, she said. <em>An excuse to have something sweet?</em> Could this be why the Dutch are so tall? <a href="http://sleepdisorders.about.com/od/sleepandgeneralhealth/a/How-Sleep-Problems-Affect-Growth-In-Children.htm" target="_blank">Children grow when asleep</a>. Better sleep, more growth. My strength increase suggests what a big effect this could be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9mNHNOMqaqM/SfDcJWRbLjI/AAAAAAAACRg/cvjLcPdaLpA/s1600-h/Omega6-Omega3GraphFix.jpg" target="_blank" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" src="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y237/fanaticcook/Omega6-Omega3GraphFix2.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a graph (<a href="http://fanaticcook.blogspot.com/2009/04/omega-6-and-omega-3-in-foods.html" target="_blank">source</a>) of the omega-3 and omega-6 content of common foods. Although walnuts are relatively high in omega-3, they are much higher in omega-6. This may be why eating them reduced the performance of my lab assistants on a brain test.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m in China, I eat 60 g/day of ground flaxseed. According to this graph, this provides 1.2 g/day omega-3, far more than I would get from any ordinary diet. For example, eating lots of fish would provide much less. I chose this amount based on <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">balance and brain speed results</a>. Flaxseed is hard to get in Beijing. Surely I am the biggest consumer in the China. I am pretty sure I am the only person ever to have optimized my intake. The best amount turned out to be surprisingly high.  &#8221;We recommend one to two tablespoons [per day],&#8221; says <a href="http://www.healthyflax.com/flax-faq/" target="_blank">a website that sells flaxseed</a>. High consumption of omega-3 should protect me against bad effects of omega-6. For example, when I eat peanuts (high in omega-6), my brain test scores don&#8217;t change.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/08/18/unhelpful-answers-ancestral-health-symposium-2013/" target="_blank">Experts</a> say flaxseed is a poor source of omega-3 because it provides short-chain omega-3 whereas the brain needs long-chain omega-3. My results &#8212; plenty of brain benefit from flaxseed &#8212; suggest this is wrong. The experiments that measured short-chain-to-long-chain conversion did not take account of the effect of experience on enzyme production. If you eat more of a certain food, your body will produce more of the enzymes that digest it. The subjects in the conversion experiments may have had little experience. If your long-chain omega-3 supply is limited by what enzymes can produce, you will get a steadier supply of long-chain omega-3 from enzymatic production than you will from eating the same amount all at once. For this reason dietary short-chain omega-3 could easily be a better source of long-chain omega-3 than dietary long-chain omega-3 itself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=196334975274806517&amp;postID=3161635954700370250">this comment from Art Ayers</a> deep in a discussion on his excellent blog <a href="http://coolinginflammation.blogspot.com/">Cooling Inflammation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Probiotic fermenting bacteria only work in the upper part of the gut, not in the colon. The anaerobic bacteria that work in the colon must be slowly acquired by persistent eating of diverse veggies to provide diverse polysaccharides and uncooked veggies to provide the bacteria.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree and disagree. It&#8217;s an excellent point that the bacteria near the stomach are quite different from the bacteria deep in the colon. So you need different sources of each. I don&#8217;t know what &#8220;probiotic fermenting bacteria&#8221; are (I was under the impression that all bacteria &#8220;ferment&#8221;), but, yeah, bacteria that live on lactose (e.g., in yogurt) are going to be quite different than bacteria that live on more complex sugars that are digested more slowly than lactose and thus pass further into the intestine.</p>
<p>To me, this explains why I like vegetables. I have no trouble avoiding fruit, bread, rice, pasta, and so on, but I hate meals without vegetables. Why? This line of thought suggests it is because they supply complex polysaccharides needed for deep-colon health. As Ayers implies, you wouldn&#8217;t need a lot. This line of thought suggests how you or nutrition scientists can decide what fermented foods to eat (some for each part of the digestive system).</p>
<p>I disagree about raw vegetables. Like most people, I don&#8217;t like raw vegetables. I like the crunchiness but the taste is too weak. That most people are like me is suggested by the fact that raw vegetables are almost never eaten without dip or dressing (which add fat and flavor) or something done to make them more palatable (e.g., sugar and liquid from tomatoes). If raw vegetables were important, even necessary, for health, the fact that they are hard to eat would make no evolutionary sense.</p>
<p>I do like pickled/fermented vegetables of all sorts, such as kimchi and sauerkraut. I believe they are a far better source of the bacteria you need than raw vegetables (they have far more of the bacteria that grow on raw vegetables than ordinary raw vegetables).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nutritionj.com/content/12/1/121" target="_blank">An article in the latest <em>Nutrition Journal</em></a> says that a &#8220;proprietary&#8221; extract of chicken meat, called CMI-168, improved brain function. From the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Normal, healthy subjects were supplemented with either placebo or CMI-168 for 6 weeks. The subjects were given a series of cognitive tests to examine their levels of cognitive functioning at the beginning and end of supplementation, as well as two weeks after termination of supplementation. The combination of these tests, namely Digit Span Backwards, Letter-Number Sequencing, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), was used to assess the subjects’ attention and working memory. . . . Subjects supplemented with CMI-168 showed significantly (p &lt; 0.01) better performance in all cognitive tests after 6 weeks’ supplementation compared to [placebo] and [their] superior performance was maintained even 2 weeks after termination of supplementation.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve heard that something in chicken improves brain function. The abstract understates the strength of the evidence; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001 (not 0.01) in almost all relevant comparisons.</p>
<p>However, several details make me question the claim.<span id="more-11503"></span></p>
<p>1. Two of the five authors work for the company that sells the chicken extract.</p>
<p>2. The subject recruitment makes no sense. &#8220;A total of 46 healthy male and female subjects aged between 35 and 65 years were recruited either as walk-in or referred from their general practitioners for counseling for life-style related issues.&#8221; Walk-in? &#8220;Life-style related issues&#8221;? &#8220;Counseling&#8221;? I have never heard of such things in this context. Nothing is said about payment or the fraction of people who declined to participate.</p>
<p>3. Vague statistics. I cannot tell if pre-treatment scores were used to make the treatment scores more sensitive. Someone who does better than average before treatment is likely to do better than average after treatment &#8212; you want to adjust for that.</p>
<p>4. No apparent learning effect. Subjects in the placebo group did not clearly improve from test to test. There is usually a big learning effect with such tests. Nothing is said about learning effects.</p>
<p>5. Vague supporting evidence. &#8220;Anecdotal evidence has long associated EOC [essence of chicken] with improving cognitive performance, especially related to learning and memory, as well as executive function,&#8221; says the paper. It provides no documentation of this evidence.</p>
<p>6. Uniformly positive results. The paper emphasizes results from nine different tests of brain function. All showed significant improvement at the same <em>p</em> value (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). When I used four different tests to measure the brain effects of flaxseed oil, different tests had widely different sensitivities.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been able to find anything supporting the idea that chicken meat (or extract) improves memory other than what this company says. <span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">I asked a Chinese friend about this; she too had never heard this claim.</span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.brandsworld.us/en/home/index.php" target="_blank">The company behind this</a><span style="font-size: 13px;"> (Brand&#8217;s) is more than a hundred years old, and essence of chicken has been their main product. In spite of my doubts, however, I would still like to test the product to see what effect it has on my reaction-time measure of brain function.</span></p>
<p>Strangely enough, after writing this post weeks ago, I noticed by accident that <strong>duck</strong> seemed to improve my brain function. I was stunned &#8212; as I said, I had never heard such a thing. I&#8217;ll describe the data later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2032706/BEYOND-HORROR-They-ate-cats-sawdust-wallpaper-paste--babies-Leningrads-agony-Nazis-tried-starve-submission-LENINGRAD-TRAGEDY-OF-A-CITY-UNDER-SIEGE-1941-44-BY-ANNA-REID.html">a review</a> of Anna Reid&#8217;s new book, <em>Leningrad: Tragedy of a City Under Siege</em>, I learned that one of the calorie sources that starving Leningraders came to eat was:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">‘macaroni’ made from flax seed for cattle</p>
<p>To which I say: <em>Damn</em>. The implication is that, before the famine, &#8220;flax seed for cattle&#8221;, which is roughly the same as flax seed, was considered unfit for human consumption. Only when starving did Leningraders stoop to eat it. I <em>can</em> buy flax seed in Beijing. But not easily.</p>
<p>The triangle is complete. I have now learned that the main things I care about in my diet, which I go to great lengths to eat every day, are all considered &#8220;disgusting&#8221; by a large number of people:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. <strong>Flax seed</strong>. It is the best source of omega-3 I have found. I eat ground flax seeds every day. Flaxseed oil goes bad too easily.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. <strong>Butter</strong>. Perhaps the most reviled food in America, at least by nutritionists. A cardiologist once told me, &#8220;You&#8217;re killing yourself&#8221; by eating it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. <strong>Fermented foods</strong>. Many fermented foods are considered disgusting &#8212; after all, they are little different than spoiled foods.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I posted a link to <a href="http://www.dumblittleman.com/2013/08/50-studies-suggest-that-magnesium.html#more" target="_blank">an article about magnesium deficiency</a> (&#8220;50 studies suggest that magnesium deficiency is killing us&#8221;), a reader who wishes to be anonymous looked into it.</p>
<blockquote><p>After reading your post about magnesium oil, I read up on it, and thought I&#8217;d try it. I didn&#8217;t notice any difference, but I have a report. In my reading, I came across stories of people who sprayed the oil on wounds.</p>
<p>I have a recurring minor irritation that, when it occurs, usually takes weeks to heal. Passing a large stool can cause small tears in the rectum, so small they don&#8217;t even bleed but nonetheless can be felt.  If another stool, even a regular-sized one, passes before the tears heal, they are painfully re-opened, though not re-opened fully. The pain is not severe but is, frankly, a pain in the ***.   In my case it usually takes weeks for the tears to completely heal.</p>
<p>I was a couple weeks into this cycle when my bottle of magnesium oil arrived.  I had read that it promotes healing and some people spray it on wounds.  So I sprayed it on my irritated area once a day for three days, and on the third day when I passed a stool there was no pain!   Never before had it healed so quickly, and I&#8217;ve had this problem at least once a year for over ten years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m impressed. This resembles a theory making an unlikely prediction that turns out to be true. Other examples of magnesium benefits are <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/04/11/paging-dr-google-magnesium-constipation-and-subarachnoid-hemorrages/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/23/scott-adams-magnesium-and-knee-pain/" target="_blank">here</a>. Maybe magnesium will improve my sleep. That should be easy to test.</p>
