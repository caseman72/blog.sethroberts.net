				<small>Sunday, July 24th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I am pleased by <a href="http://ihaveneverdonethisbefore.com/2011/07/21/two-successful-dietary-experiments/">these results</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After a possibly overzealous dentist told me I need a gum graft [which <a href="http://www.experienceproject.com/stories/Had-A-Gum-Graft/250104">may cost $3000</a>], my husband encouraged me to start taking flaxseed oil. A few people online have <a href="../2011/03/03/root-planing-cancelled/">reported</a> that flaxseed oil dramatically improved their gum health, and we figured it was worth a shot.</p>
<p><strong>My initial dose of flaxseed oil was two tablespoons a day</strong>, and<strong> my gums stopped bleeding and hurting within three days</strong>. This is pretty huge for me, because <strong>my gums have been bleeding since I was in junior high</strong>. [Emphasis added.] At the same time, I added using a Sonicare toothbrush and flossing a little more vigorously. Considering that I had tried these things in the past without the flaxseed oil and they only made me bleed more, I feel like the flaxseed oil is the difference maker.</p>
<p>I have subsequently reduced my flaxseed oil dose to one tablespoon, which I feel is more appropriate for a woman my size. I haven’t gained any weight from the flaxseed oil, which was a bit of a surprise. Taking it in the morning seems to help curb my appetite by at least the 130 calories it consumes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The online reports she mentions are from this blog. A recap: <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2006/07/05/brain-food/">Because of the Shangri-La Diet</a>, one evening I took four or five flaxseed oil capsules. The next morning, I was surprised to notice that putting on my shoes standing up, which I&#8217;d done hundreds of times, was much easier than usual. This suggested that the flaxseed oil had improved my balance. I started to carefully measure my balance and varied my flaxseed oil intake. My measurements showed that variations in amount of flaxseed oil really did affect my balance. They also suggested the best dose. My balance improved up to a dose of 3 tablespoons/day of flaxseed oil. So the best dose was about 3 tablespoons per day. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">I blogged about this</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-surgery-commuted/">Tyler Cowen</a>, inspired by my results, started taking 2 tablespoons/day. A month later, he no longer needed gum surgery. Knowing nothing about my flaxseed oil intake or Tyler Cowen&#8217;s results, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/03/28/omega-3-and-dental-health/">my dentist told me</a> my gums were in excellent shape, better than ever. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/22/at-thanksgiving-dinner/">My sister&#8217;s gums</a> showed similar improvement. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-even-more/">Tucker Max</a> noticed his gums stopped bleeding after he started taking flaxseed oil. He&#8217;d had bleeding gums most of his adult life. Nothing else had helped. He also found <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/">training injuries healed faster</a>. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/16/omega-3-what-happens-when-you-stop/">When he stopped drinking flaxseed oil</a>, his gums soon got worse. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/03/root-planing-cancelled/">Carl Willat</a> noticed dramatic gum improvement. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/03/joyce-cohen-gets-her-teeth-cleaned/">Joyce Cohen</a> had excellent results (her gums were &#8220;in great shape &#8212; better than ever&#8221;). <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/03/joyce-cohen-gets-her-teeth-cleaned/#comment-48774">Tim Beneke</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/#comment-342479">Jack Rusher</a> had similar results. <a href="http://forum.quantifiedself.com/thread-the-effect-of-diet-on-energy-focus?pid=505#pid505">Gary Wolf</a>, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t like the mental effects. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101026090655.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29">A recent epidemiological study</a> found a weak correlation between inflamed gums and omega-3 intake.</p>
<p>What have I learned? Above all, that such a pattern of results is possible. These results suggest there was/is a big hole in the usual nutritional ideas. Tyler Cowen, me, my sister, etc., were eating a conventionally &#8220;good diet&#8221; yet there was a lot of room for improvement, both in brain function and overall inflammation level. (I&#8217;m sure flaxseed oil heals gums because it reduces inflammation.) And improvement wasn&#8217;t hard &#8212; there was a simple fix. In other words, <strong>omega-3 deficiency is very common</strong>. The conventional deficiency diseases, such as scurvy and pellagra, were/are rare. They appeared only under extreme conditions with very limited diets (e.g., prison, long sea voyage). Yet just as scurvy and pellagra are easily cured, there is a simple cure for omega-3 deficiency: about 2 tablespoons/day of flaxseed oil. (Perhaps ground flaxseed is an even better source.)</p>
<p>Other facts support the idea of widespread omega-3 deficiency. When gums are very red, and bleed very easily, it&#8217;s called gingivitis. According to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3522645">this article</a>, &#8221; estimates of the general prevalence of adult gingivitis vary from approximately 50 to 100%&#8221;. Heart disease is common. There&#8217;s plenty of evidence that <a href="http://thelancet.it/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2810%2970029-3/fulltext">heart disease is caused by inflammation</a> (gated). For example, it&#8217;s well-known that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/17/why-does-gum-disease-correlate-with-heart-disease/">inflamed gums correlate with heart disease</a>. Statins may reduce heart disease &#8212; to the mild extent they do &#8212; <a href="http://www.spacedoc.com/statins_inflammation_heart_disease.html">because they reduce inflammation</a>.</p>
<p>I also learned that psychology can help improve general health (too much inflammation causes all sorts of problems, as Tucker Max&#8217;s experience suggests). My background in experimental psychology made it easy for me to measure balance.  I also found other mental tests were sensitive to flaxseed oil. These mental tests were like an animal model in the sense that they made helpful experiments (e.g., different doses) much easier. My friend Kenneth Carpenter, in <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/117/3/599.full.pdf">his book about the discovery of Vitamin C</a> (gated), stressed the importance of an animal model of scurvy. Once the best dose of flaxseed oil (for me) was known, it turned out to be easy to take a dose that produced dramatic improvement (in others).</p>
<p>The idea that psychology and self-experimentation can improve overall health is new. I presented my flaxseed oil results at a meeting of the Psychonomic Society a few years ago. After my talk, one member of the audience, a professor of psychology at Illinois State University, angrily complained that my talk was &#8220;pop culture&#8221; &#8212; not even pop psychology &#8212; and said I shouldn&#8217;t have been allowed to speak. He thought I had made elementary mistakes.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Re-reading <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/16/omega-3-what-happens-when-you-stop/">an old post</a> recently, I found this comment by Tucker Max:</p>
<blockquote><p>I took four tablespoons [of flaxseed oil] a few hours ago, instead of the regular two,  thinking that maybe I could load up and it might help me get back to  normal quickly. The pain is pretty much the same, and I just brushed and  my gums bled, so obviously the flaxseed oil takes more than a few hours  to affect those problems. But–and I haven’t measured this with reaction  tests like you do–I feel considerably more mentally alert right now. I  don’t know if I felt like this before, and maybe I didn’t notice it  because it came on slowly, or maybe I need four tablespoons at once to  see a difference, but I really do feel the difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>By coincidence I had noticed the same thing the day before: I was distinctly sharper than usual a few hours after drinking flaxseed oil (two tablespoons), as measured by my arithmetic test. I had noticed the same thing twice before &#8212; years earlier &#8212; but had decided not to study it in detail because it was much easier to study the long-term effects of flaxseed oil.</p>
<p>I wrote Tucker to say he had been right. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, there&#8217;s zero doubt in my mind now that fish oil/omega 3 is crucial to brain function. If I don&#8217;t take it, I can&#8217;t write effectively.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s very interesting. Sure, <strong>drugs </strong>have short-term effects. If you ingest caffeine, for example, it will make you more awake for a few hours. But drugs are dangerous. The notion that a <strong>necessary nutrient</strong> has benefits that last only a few hours is new. (The notion that a necessary nutrient can make us distinctly sharper will also be new to most people, but not to readers of this blog.) Perhaps we should eat omega-3 every few hours. You&#8217;ve heard of RDAs (Recommended Daily Allowances). Perhaps the future will contain RHAs (Recommended Hourly Allowances).</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been reading this blog for several years, see <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">these posts</a> for background. Flaxseed oil also will make you smarter long-term, e.g., the next day. The short-term effect is in addition to the long-term effect.</p>

				<small>Monday, June 13th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21540421">A new study</a> in <em>JAMA</em> found higher salt consumption strongly associated with <strong>less </strong>death from heart disease. The association with total mortality (more salt, less death) was almost significant. To grasp the strength of the evidence, see <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/305/17/1777/F2.large.jpg">this</a>. Yes, it&#8217;s a correlation, but I don&#8217;t know of any examples of such a strong correlation reversing (so that more salt is now correlated with more death) when now-unknown confounders are taken into account. In 1998, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5379/898.short">Gary Taubes argued </a>that the benefits of salt reduction were greatly overstated. The new study did find more salt correlated with higher systolic blood pressure but in the big picture (mortality) that didn&#8217;t matter. If all those warnings about salt had any effect, the new study suggests their effect was negative.</p>
<p>Perhaps people who eat less salt are more credulous (they believed the experts) &#8212; and this damages them in other ways? Perhaps they rely on doctors more, for example. It is hard to interpret this finding in a way that makes mainstream health care look good. A <em></em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/health/research/04salt.html?ref=salt"><em>New York Times</em> article about the study</a> points out that &#8220;the new study is not the only one to find adverse effects of low-sodium diets.&#8221; And it reports what someone at the Centers for Disease Control said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dr. Peter Briss, a medical director at the centers, said that the study  was small; that its subjects were relatively young, with an average age  of 40 at the start; and that with few cardiovascular events, it was hard  to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>Dr. Briss fails to understand statistics. Ordinary statistical calculations take sample size and number of events into consideration when indicating the strength of the evidence. That&#8217;s the one of the main purposes of those calculations. As for &#8220;relatively young,&#8221; I know of nothing to suggest that the effects of sodium reverse with age &#8212; so it is irrelevant that the subjects were relatively young. That someone at the CDC is so clueless is remarkable.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2000/08/0066912">How one obscure sentence upset the <em>New York Times</em></a> by Renata Adler. A great and revealing story. My explanation of the <em>Times&#8217;</em>s over-the-top hostility to Adler&#8217;s book  (<em>Gone: The Last Days of The New Yorker</em>) differs from Adler&#8217;s. She says it was due to her lack of deference, whereas I suspect currying favor with Charles McGrath, the editor of the <em>New York Times Book Review, </em>was a big part of it. In <em>Gone</em>, Adler criticized McGrath, who was apparently very upset. <em>Gone</em> is the rare critique that combines negativity and deep familiarity. Usually you have one or the other.</li>

					<p><a href="http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1044471/Meat-consumption-and-weight-gain.html">This article by Eoin O&#8217;Connell</a> reports <a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/92/2/398.abstract">a study in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em></a> (the top nutrition journal) that found a correlation between meat consumption and weight gain: The more meat you ate, the more weight you gained over five years. <em>Meat is fattening! </em>reported several newspapers.</p>
<p>Mr. O&#8217;Connell did something unusual for a health journalist: He thought for himself. I don&#8217;t mean he applied a formulaic criticism (e.g., &#8220;correlation does not equal causation&#8221;). That&#8217;s not thinking, that&#8217;s knee-jerking. Mr. O&#8217;Connell read the paper. And he noticed an interaction: The correlation between meat consumption and weight gain depended on activity level. The study involved about 400,000 people. The researchers put each person in one of four activity levels: inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, and active. There was a correlation between red-meat consumption and weight only for the two most active groups (moderately active and active). The original article reported that this interaction was significant:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The relation between red meat                      and weight gain was also stronger in physically  active subjects compared with moderately inactive or inactive subjects (<em>P</em> values for interaction = 0.02)</p>
<p>The obvious implication of this interaction, as Mr. O&#8217;Connell says, is that meat caused muscle gain. Weight differences between more-meat and less-meat eaters were due to differences in muscle mass. This puts an entirely different spin on the results. The alternative explanation is quite plausible. I once had a grad student who was a vegetarian. When he was an undergrad, he told me, he and his roommate would go to the weight room and do similar sets. His roommate, who ate meat, rapidly gained muscle; he did not. Of course, meat = animal muscle.</p>
<p>Mr. O&#8217;Connell continued to the really interesting part of his article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Perhaps not so surprisingly, the consideration that muscle is a form of  weight gain does not appear in the newspaper articles but much more  surprising is the fact that it does not appear in the original journal  article either.</p>
<p>The <em>AJCN </em>article has <strong>fifty authors</strong>. Not one of them, apparently, noticed this all-important point! Nor did the reviewers for this prestigious journal. The article concludes: &#8220;Our results                      are therefore in favor of the public health  recommendation to decrease meat consumption for health improvement.&#8221; No, they&#8217;re not, if the <em>more meat, more muscle</em> explanation is correct.</p>
<p>Most prestigious journal. Fifty authors. Huge expense. Total F-up in the sense that the final conclusion is probably wrong. (To be fair, the paper has plenty of value in other ways.) Congratulations, Mr. O&#8217;Connell, for noticing.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://www.adultswim.com/blog/interviews/celeb-nerdy-tucker-max.html">this interview</a>, <a href="http://www.tuckermax.com">Tucker Max</a> talks about eating paleo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Once I started doing this, I started feeling so much better. My brain  felt like it worked better. Everything about me improved. So I kinda  went down the rabbit hole, and I started reading up on diet and  nutrition from alternate sources. Art De Vany, Robb Wolf, and Loren  Cordain, they didn&#8217;t invent it but they kinda popularized the concept of  paleo eating. I realized that if you&#8217;re just a normal person, and you  have the normal ideas about diet and nutrition, everything you know is  wrong.</p>
<p>If you ask me, Tucker&#8217;s enthusiasm/support for paleo is huge. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/107032.Max_Planck">Max Planck</a> said progress happens funeral by funeral.  I say it happens keg party by keg party &#8212; college students,  more than anyone else, have open minds. A friend told me that when she  was a freshman in college, her sociology professor criticized the  textbook. <em>Whoa! </em>she thought. <em>Textbooks can be criticized!?</em> She had thought they were beyond criticism. As far as I can tell, American college students respect Tucker more than they respect anyone else. (My Tsinghua students may favor Nassim Taleb.) For example, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MORGANWTF/status/60851334848585728">this recent tweet</a>: &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/TuckerMax">TuckerMax</a> is my idol. and he&#8217;s on this paleodiet&#8230;so i think im going to do it too.&#8221;  I found no tweets about the dietary influence of Michelle Obama (&#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/badrobot68/status/66218755713286144">coolest First Lady ever</a>&#8220;).</p>
<p>In spite of what the interview was shortened to say, Tucker got the idea of eating flaxseed oil from this blog, especially <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-surgery-commuted/">Tyler Cowen&#8217;s experience</a>. He wrote to me about it at the time. I posted his comments about dental health (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-even-more/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/16/omega-3-what-happens-when-you-stop/">here</a>) and sports injuries (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/25/omega-3-and-sports-injuries-more/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/02/26/omega-3-and-sports-injuries-part-3/">here</a>) under the name Anonymous.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce that Tucker will be talking at the upcoming Ancestral Health Symposium at UCLA. The title of his talk is::</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>From Cave to Cage: Mixed Martial Arts in Ancestral Health</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sorry Tucker Max fans, symposium tickets are sold out. But after the conference you will be able to see the talk on the website.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tucker&#8217;s latest book is <a href="http://www.tuckermax.com/blog/details-about-assholes-finish-first/"><em>Assholes Finish First</em></a>.<strong><br />

				<small>Wednesday, March 23rd, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I eat a low-carb diet for reasons that have nothing to do with weight loss: To keep my blood sugar down. I am sure high blood sugar is bad. A few months ago, I noticed that my lips were chapped, which was unusual. I suspected it was due to lack of Vitamin C. About two months before that, I had stopped doing two things that I usually did: taking a multi-vitamin pill (which had Vitamin C) and eating fruit. I don&#8217;t know if the Vitamin C in the pill is absorbed but I&#8217;m sure the Vitamin C in fruit is. I started eating kumquats &#8212; the skins of four kumquats/day. (One kumquat contains about <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1935/2">15% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C</a>). My lips returned to normal.</p>
<p>Paul Jaminet, author of <em>Perfect Health Diet</em>, had <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=1139">a similar experience</a>, which I knew nothing about when I noticed my chapped lips. While eating &#8220;a lot of vegetables but no starches and hardly any fruit,&#8221; he developed outright scurvy, including wounds that wouldn&#8217;t heal.Â  This happened while he was taking a multi-vitamin pill with 90 mg Vitamin C (my four kumquats contain only 35 mg Vitamin C). &#8220;Four grams a day of vitamin C for two months cured all the scurvy symptoms,&#8221; he found.</p>
<p>Why do we like sweet foods? The usual answer (<a href="http://www.suite101.com/content/an-explanation-of-taste-a94569">so that we will eat more calories</a>) is nonsense (except for children). The striking thing about our liking for sweetness is that it disappears when we are really hungry, which is the opposite of what the calorie-seeking explanation predicts. Desserts are served at the end of a meal because they taste much better then. But our liking for sweetness (when we&#8217;re not hungry) is so strong and obvious it must mean something important. I think it is pushing us to eat more fruit so that we will get enough Vitamin C. Fruits are much sweeter than other food groups and they are much higher in Vitamin C. We don&#8217;t like sweet things when we are hungry because a high-fruit diet is terrible (it is low in omega-3, other necessary fats, several minerals, and microbes, for example). But a small amount of fruit may be a big help. Paul and my experiences suggest it may be hard to get enough Vitamin C in other ways.</p>
<p><strong>More </strong>Paul has <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=2842">a different idea about why we like sweetness</a>.</p>

					<p>My friend Carl Willat writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last June I went to the dentist for a checkup and cleaning, fully  expecting my gums to be in great shape since I had been diligently using  my Braun Oral B electric toothbrush. Â To my surprise and disappointment  the hygienist told me the pockets had actually become deeper and that  she was seeing bleeding in many places, to the point where she was  recommending I have my roots planed, a painful and expensive procedure I  had undergone once before many years ago. So of course I went home and  started taking the flax seed oil and ground flax seed ["a couple of tablespoons a day of oil, plus random amounts of ground flax seed"] as you had  recommended. Â I also started using a Sonicare toothbrush at that point  so it&#8217;s hard to figure out the degree to which either variable might be  responsible, but today she said my gums were much better, and had hardly  bled at all during the measurement of the pockets. All talk of root  planing was forgotten.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.costhelper.com/cost/health/teeth-cleaning.html">this</a>, root planing costs $400-$1600. After Tyler Cowen started drinking flaxseed oil (2 T/day), <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/07/todays-happines.html">he no longer needed gum surgery</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard to get well-preserved flaxseed oil in Beijing (it goes bad at room temperature) so I now take 66 g/day ground flaxseed instead of 2 T/day flaxseed oil. I add it to yogurt twice/day. I don&#8217;t know if ground flaxseed is healthier or less healthy than flaxseed oil but it is much less trouble. Preservation is no problem (flaxseeds can be stored at room temperature) and ground flaxseed requires zero willpower to eat with yogurt. I had to push myself a little to drink the oil.</p>

					<p>Joseph Buchignani, a businessman in Shenzhen, has suffered from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) since he was a teenager. He is now in his 20s. By trial and error, he discovered that a meat-only diet eliminated his IBS. However, it also caused craving for carbs. Because carbs caused IBS, he couldn&#8217;t simply eat carbs. He tried many ways of getting rid of the craving for carbs:  eating more animal fat, eating less animal fat,  eating oil, eating lard, and eating different kinds of animals and cuts of meat. He varied how he cooked  the meat, eatingÂ  especially fresh meat, and eating fresh whole fish. All of these attempts failed. He did not try taking a multivitamin pill.</p>
<p>Finally he tried adding egg to the meat. That eliminated his craving for carbs. It made his diet much more sustainable.</p>
<p>This is fascinating for four reasons.</p>
<p>1. Sure, some cravings reflect nutrient deficiencies. (Not all cravings: An alcoholic craves alcohol.) But in the cases I know about, there is an obvious or semi-obvious connection between the craving and the deficiency. For example, people who chew too much ice (<a href="http://www.brighthub.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/articles/92909.aspx">pagophagia</a>) crave ice to chew. They are iron-deficient. Eating iron eliminates the pagophagia. Long ago, a craving to eat something crunchy would have led you to eat bones. Bone marrow is high in iron. So the craving makes sense. In contrast, there is no obvious or semi-obvious connection between carbs and eggs.</p>
<p>2. It suggests that a paleo diet is a good place to <strong>start</strong> looking for the ideal diet. Paleo ideas suggest a high-meat diet. But no matter how long you study what Stone-Age people ate, you will not figure out that eggs will eliminate carb cravings.</p>
<p>3. Like many people, especially those doing paleo, I eat mostly meat and vegetables (a conventional low-carb diet). Unlike most low-carbers, I also eat lots of fermented foods. I don&#8217;t crave carbs, perhaps because of the lactose in yogurt or the sucrose in kombucha. It hadn&#8217;t occurred to me to start eating eggs regularly but Joseph&#8217;s discovery suggests I should try it.</p>
<p>4. Joseph&#8217;s personal science led him to discover something highly useful and completely non-obvious.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>You have probably read hundreds of recommendations to eat more polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which in practice means omega-6 and omega-3. If you shop at Whole Foods, you may see Udo&#8217;s Blend, a blend of PUFAs which includes both omega-3 and omega-6, as if someone isn&#8217;t getting enough omega-6. It is unquestionable that omega-3 is beneficial but there is plenty of evidence that omega-6 is harmful, starting with <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/02/02/the-israeli-paradox/">the Israeli Paradox</a>. Why are they lumped together?</p>
<p><a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&#038;aid=7930322&#038;fulltextType=RV&#038;fileId=S0007114510004010">A just-published paper in the <em>British Journal of Nutrition</em></a> makes several new points about the relation of PUFAs and heart disease. Its main point is a new look at experiments in which one group was given more PUFAs than another group.Â  Those experiments &#8212; there are only about eight &#8212; can be divided into two groups: (a) experiments in which the treated group was given <strong>both omega-3 and omega-6</strong> and (b) experiments in which the treated group was given <span lang="zh-CN" id="result_box" class="short_text"><strong>only omega-6</strong>.</span><span lang="zh-CN" id="result_box" class="short_text"><span /></span> The two groups of experiments seem to have different results. In the &#8220;both&#8221; experiments the treated group seems to benefit; in the &#8220;only omega-6&#8243; experiments, the treated group seems to be worse off. Suggesting that omega-3 and omega-6 have different effects on heart disease. They have been lumped together because experiments have lumped them together (varied both at the same time).<br />
Experiments that try to measure the effect of PUFAs usually say they are replacing saturated fats. More PUFAs, less butter. The paper points out that studies of the effect of PUFAs have at least sometimes confounded reduction in saturated fats with reduction in trans fats. Benefits of the change may be due to the reduction in trans fats, not the reduction in saturate fats.</p>
<p>The paper also makes several good points about the Finnish study, a classic in the fat/heart disease literature. Supposedly the Finnish study showed that PUFAs (replacing saturated fats) reduce heart disease. It had hundreds of subjects but they were not randomized separately. The subjects were divided by hospital. Everyone in one hospital got one diet, everyone in a second hospital got a different diet. This meant it was easy for there to be confoundings (i.e., the treatment wasn&#8217;t the only difference between the groups). Indeed, there were big differences in consumption of a certain dangerous medication and margarine between hospitals. (Margarine is high in trans fats.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the first author, Christopher Ramsden, who works at NIH, is responsible for the high quality of this paper.<br />

					<p>A perfectly good <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/11745528"><em>Economist </em>article about food and brain function</a> includes the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many studies suggest that diets which are rich in trans- and saturated  fatty acids, such as those containing a lot of deep-fried foods and  butter, have bad effects on cognition. Rodents put on such diets show  declines in cognitive performance within weeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whereas I found butter improved my cognitive performance within a day. And pork fat improved my sleep within a day. On the other hand, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if foods deep-fried in plant oils, such as corn oil, are bad for the brain.<em /></p>

				<small>Sunday, November 21st, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>You can find statements like the following in a hundred places:</p>
<blockquote><p>Both fish and flax are good sources of  omega-3. Flaxseed oil is less expensive, which can be an important consideration.  The main difference is that flaxseed oil contains only alpha-linoleic  acid (ALA), which is the parent compound from which other  omega-3 fatty acids are derived. This leaves it to your body  to do the conversion to the other forms it needs, eicosapentaonoic  acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The problem is  that the conversion is not always that efficient, and the body often  uses the ALA for extra energy, leaving less for conversion to the other  types. The body uses various enzymes to convert ALA to other omega-3s,  and the process is not very efficient, especially as one gets older.  Estimates of the rate of conversion range from 5% to 25%. In order to  make sufficient amounts of EPA and DHA, one needs to consume 5-6  times more ALA than if one relies on fish oil alone. Fish oil, on  the other hand, contains the other forms and delivers them directly  to your body with no conversion necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn&#8217;t that simple. Here are three things I rarely see mentioned:</p>
<p>1. <strong>The conversion rate is not fixed.</strong> It depends on the amount of the conversion enzyme, which increases with ALA exposure. The body makes the enzymes it needs and doesn&#8217;t make the enzymes it doesn&#8217;t need. You don&#8217;t have enzymes to digest food you don&#8217;t eat &#8212; but if you start to eat them you will build up the enzymes. The measurements of ALA conversion rate I have seen measured the conversion rate without giving the subjects extensive exposure to ALA before the test. (Measurements of glycemic index have the same problem.) They should be considered lower bounds of what would happen with long exposure.</p>
<p>2.Â  <strong>Time release is good not bad.</strong> When you take a dose of flax oil, its ALA is converted to DHA and EPA, which takes time, thus smoothing out the supply versus time function. If you take a dose of fish oil, the brain receives a sudden burst of DHA and EPA. It is likely that a smoother supply is better.</p>
<p>3. <strong>ALA (omega-3) conversion blocks AA (omega-6) conversion</strong>. Omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids are almost identical. The enzyme that converts short-chain omega-3 to long-chain omega-3 also converts short-chain omega-6 to long-chain omega-6. Long-chain omega-6 probably has bad effects in your brain, at least in large amounts, because it displaces long-chain omega-3. For industrial reasons, our diets are high in short-chain omega-6. Having ALA in your system, which flax oil provides but fish oil does not, slows down the conversion of short-chain omega-6 to long-chain omega-6 by occupying the conversion enzymes.</p>

				<small>Friday, November 19th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>After I moved to China in September, I was surprised that my arithmetic speed went <strong>down</strong>. (That is, I got faster.) I had lowered it from about 630 msec/problem to 600 msec/problem <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/08/arithmetic-and-butter.php">by eating lots of butter</a>. I had no idea how to lower it further. I didn&#8217;t deliberately change my diet in China but it was quite different. I kept some things the same: the amount and brand of butter/day, the amount and brand of flaxseed oil/day.</p>
<p>I failed to figure out why I had gotten faster. I reduced the amount of flaxseed oil from 3 T (tablespoons) per day to 2 T per day. It made no difference. (In the beginning of my interest in flaxseed oil, change from 2 T/day to 3 T/day <strong>had </strong>made a difference.) Perhaps because of the butter.</p>
<p>Surprised that the change from 3 T/day to 2 T/day hadn&#8217;t made a difference, I went down to 1 T/day for two weeks, then back to 2 T/day. Both changes made a difference:</p>
<p><a title="2010-11-16 2T vs 1T flaxseed oil by twoutopias, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sethroberts/5187998149/"><img width="500" height="281" alt="2010-11-16 2T vs 1T flaxseed oil" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5187998149_14d7467a00.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Each point is a separate test. Each test had 32 arithmetic problems (e.g., 3+4, 11-3). In the beginning of the data shown in the figure I tested myself once per day. After 12 days I started doing two tests/day, one right after the other. I was curious about the repeatability of the numbers; it wasn&#8217;t hard; it was a way to get better measurements. Averaging over the tests for each day to get one value per day, combining the 19 2-T/day (before) days and the 11 2-T/day (after) days, and comparing the combination to the final 7 1-T/day days, <em>t</em>(38) = 6.5. If you&#8217;re not familiar with <em>t </em>values, <em>t</em> = 2 is a barely reliable difference, <em>t</em> = 4 is a very clear difference.</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">more evidence</a> that flaxseed oil improves brain function. It interests me because it implies the optimum dose is close to 2 T/day. It cost about $20 and took 1 person-month. In contrast, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/11/17/dha-did-not-slow-alzheimers/">the DHA-Alzheimer&#8217;s study I mentioned two days ago</a> cost about $1 million and took about 7000 person-months. And used (a) a cruder something-versus-nothing comparison, b) a less-sensitive between-subjects comparison, and (c) a more ethically-problematic placebo-controlled design.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, November 2nd, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Via <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/10/supplements-kill.html">Robin Hanson</a> I found <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/297/8/842">this study of the effects of antioxidant supplements</a>. It studied five (e.g., Vitamins A and C). Overall they were slightly harmful, except selenium.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t intuitive &#8212; why should they differ? &#8212; but fits well with previous work:</p>
<p>1. Evidence for benefits of selenium is overwhelming. You can look at a county-by-county map of US cancer rates and see a sharp drop along a certain line in the northeast. The line separates different geology. There is much more selenium in the soil on the low-cancer side of the line. Yet another case where correlation is powerful evidence for causation. An experiment with selenium supplementation found a reduction in cancer.</p>
<p>2. Several years ago, <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/summary/2004/final-caret1204">two experiments found Vitamin A supplements increased lung cancer</a>. (<a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199404143301501">Another study</a>.) <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/7706860/Too-many-vitamin-tablets-could-be-bad-for-your-health.html">Later experiments cast doubt on Vitamins C and E</a>. As one of Robin&#8217;s readers put it: &#8220;two of which were previously well known to be bad for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given this previous research, which is far more persuasive than the current study, the interesting contribution of the new study is methodological: will a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies reach the right conclusions? Will the signal outweigh the many sources of bias and error? In fact, it did. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/10/27/periodontitis-and-omega-3/">Again suggesting</a> that severe critics of epidemiology, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/10/13/the-contribution-of-john-ioannidis/">such as John Ioannidis</a>, go too far.</p>

					<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">after I started taking about 3 tablespoons/day of flaxseed oil</a>, my dentist told me my gums were much healthier. They were less red, more pink. Friends and blog readers who took flaxseed oil in similar amounts <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-even-more/">noticed the same thing</a>. Tyler Cowen&#8217;s gums improved so much <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-surgery-commuted/">he no longer needed gum surgery</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101026090655.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29">An epidemiological study</a> in the November <em>Journal of the American Dietetic Association</em> reports correlations between omega-3 intake and periodontitis (an extreme form of inflamed gums). The more omega-3, the less periodontitis. I&#8217;m sure that sufficient omega-3 intake cures periodontitis so this study has methodological interest for me. One interesting point is that the study reached a correct conclusion &#8212; contrary to <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/10/13/the-contribution-of-john-ioannidis/">the nihilism of John Ioannidis</a>. Another is that the correlations were weak. The risk of periodontitis was only 20% lower in the group (quintile?) with the highest omega-3 intake. Although there were 9000 subjects, there was no significant correlation with linolenic acid, the form of omega-3 found in flaxseed oil.</p>

				<small>Monday, October 25th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>At a Mr. Lee&#8217;s restaurant (a Chinese chain), I started chatting with a girl sitting near me. I told her I was a psychology professor. &#8220;You know what people are thinking,&#8221; she said. I lamely said, no, I study what foods make the brain work best.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the English word for it,&#8221; she said. She drew a walnut.Â  Good for your brain, her parents had told her. I was astonished. When I got to China, my arithmetic scores mysteriously <em>improved</em>. I had expected them to get worse, if anything. I tried to duplicate my American diet in Beijing but it is hard to duplicate the flaxseed oil. (Chinese flaxseed oil is worthless. I can bring it from America but not easily, and it&#8217;s impossible to keep it cold the whole way.) I had tested various explanations of the improvement but none held up.</p>
<p>I was starting to believe the reason for the improvement was walnuts. I have two servings/day of yogurt, each time with walnuts. I ate a lot of yogurt with walnuts in Berkeley, too; this was not a dramatic change. But maybe I eat more walnuts in China, and maybe the walnuts have more omega-3.Â  Maybe the walnuts are fresher. In Berkeley I put ground flaxseed in my yogurt (in addition to walnuts), without obvious improvement. Walnuts are lower in omega-3 than flaxseeds.</p>
<p>A Chinese friend of mine had told me the same thing &#8212; that her parents had said that walnuts are good for the brain. This is a common Chinese belief, mingled with the curious idea that they are good for the brain because they look like a brain. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut">The <em>Wikipedia</em> entry for <em>walnut</em></a>, which includes its use in Chinese medicine, says nothing about improving brain function. <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&#038;dbid=99">This long article</a> about the benefits of walnuts doesn&#8217;t connect them directly with better brain function. It does say they are considered &#8220;brain food&#8221; because of high omega-3 content and links to <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&#038;dbid=99#nutritionalprofile">a page</a> that says 1/4 cup of walnuts (25 g) has 2.3 g of omega-3. I am now consuming 2 tablespoons/day of flaxseed oil, which contains 14 g of omega-3. I have sometimes consumed 3 or 4 tablespoons/day (with 21 or 28 g omega-3). You can see why 2 g doesn&#8217;t impress me, especially when added to 14 g. I thought I was getting the optimal amount of omega-3 from flaxseed oil. Adding a small amount to the optimal amount shouldn&#8217;t have a noticeable effect. <a href="http://guide2herbalremedies.com/11-foods-for-brain/">This article</a> says walnuts are brain food because of their lecithin content. Lecithin is used to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>Miraculously I can gather better evidence by myself, in a month, than all the evidence I&#8217;ve found. I simply vary how much walnuts I eat and see what happens to my arithmetic score. The experiment is worth doing because of the common Chinese belief and my puzzlingly good scores. Maybe walnuts help a brain that is already getting plenty of omega-3. Maybe not.</p>

				<small>Friday, October 8th, 2010</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Two studies of the effect of dairy consumption on health have recently appeared. Both suggest it is healthy. <a href="http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n6/abs/ejcn201045a.html">One of them</a>&#8211; a prospective study where about 1500 people were followed for 16 years &#8212; found no association of dairy intake with overall mortality but did find a protective effect of full-fat dairy against heart disease. The study considered lots of possibilities and the authors write &#8221; it is important to take into account the large number of comparisons  considered in this study and thus we cannot rule out the possibility  that the protective association between full-fat dairy intake and  cardiovascular mortality was due to chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mentioned this study <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/06/02/butterfat-good/">earlier</a>. It gains more credence because of the <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/k2475344067821um/fulltext.html">other study</a>, which is a meta-analysis. The second study found protective effects of dairy products on several outcomes, including overall mortality:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meta-analyses suggest a reduction in risk in the subjects with the  highest dairy  consumption relative to those with the lowest intake: 0.87  (0.77, 0.98) for all-cause deaths, 0.92 (0.80, 0.99) for ischaemic heart disease, 0.79 (0.68, 0.91) for stroke and 0.85 (0.75,  0.96) for incident diabetes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is good news for me since I eat  yogurt and butter every day.</p>
