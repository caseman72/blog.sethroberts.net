				<small>Saturday, July 14th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>One day in 2009, I ate a large amount of pork belly (very high in fat &#8212; pork belly is the cut used to make bacon). That night I slept an unusually long time.Â The next day I had more energy than usual. This led me to do an experiment in which I ate a pork belly meal (with lots of pork belly, about 250 g) on some days but not others. I compared my sleep after the two sorts of days. I kept constant the number of one-legged stands I did each day because <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">that has an effect</a>. During the first half of the experiment I kept this constant at 4; during the second half, at 2. I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2009/10/31/effect-of-animal-fat-on-sleep-more/">originally posted the results</a> only from the first half.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve analyzed the results from both halves. Here are ratings of how rested I felt when I woke up, on a scale where 0 = 0% = not rested at all and 100 = 100% = completely rested.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012-07-15-effect-of-pork-fat-on-rested-ratings.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7096" title="2012-07-15 effect of pork fat on rested ratings" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012-07-15-effect-of-pork-fat-on-rested-ratings-591x300.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>The two halves were essentially the same: pork belly produced a big improvement.Â  Here are the results for sleep duration.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012-07-15-effect-of-pork-fat-on-sleep-duration1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7093" title="2012-07-15 effect of pork fat on sleep duration" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012-07-15-effect-of-pork-fat-on-sleep-duration1-591x300.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>No clear effect of pork belly in either half of the experiment.</p>
<p>The main thing I learned was that pork fat really helps. The effect is remarkably clear. With micronutrients, such as Vitamin C, the body has considerable storage. It may take months without the nutrient to become noticeably deficient. With omega-3, which is between a micronutrient and a macronutrient, my experiments found that it takes about twoÂ  days to start to see deficiency. With pork fat there seems to be no storage at all. I needed to eat lots of pork fat every day to get the best sleep. That repletion and depletion are fast made this experiment easy. How curious we are so often told animal fat is bad when an easy experiment shows it is good, at least for me.</p>

					<p>Five years ago programmer and author <a href="http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/wheat-gluten-sinus/">David Kadavy suffered from constant sinus infections</a>. The doctors he had seen about it hadn&#8217;t helped: &#8220;They tended to test me for environmental allergies, stick a camera up my nose, and ultimately prescribe some bullshit allergy medication that didnât work.&#8221; What did work:</p>
<blockquote><p>One day I was reading an old book on holistic medicine. Of course, the first thing I wanted to know was how could I prevent being constantly congested. The book said that foods such as wheat, meat, and dairy often contributed to excess mucous production â and thus, sinusitis. I was miserable, and clearly willing to try <a href="http://www.kadavy.net/blog/archive/2005/06/sinusrinse_nasa.php">anything</a>, so I cut out all three of those things the very next day.</p>
<p>Within two days, the difference was incredible. My head had cleared up, I had boundless energy, and other problems â such as a patch of eczema that I had on my eyelid for years â all cleared up. . . . Through a bit of experimentation I was able to place the blame for my sinus woes (and that eczema thing) on wheat. . . . Not only did the experience have me looking at food differently, it also had me looking at medicine differently. How could I see so many GPs, allergy specialists, ENT [ear nose and throat] specialists, and dermatologists without a single one of them saying âyou know, you should look at your diet?â</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, how could that be? And, to paraphrase <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/06/a-visual-illusion.html">Alex Tabarrok</a>, what else are they missing? </p>

					<p>Some people avoid all carbs (that is, all bread, pasta, rice, etc.). Others advocate &#8220;safe starches&#8221;. No doubt wheat can be dangerous &#8212; witness celiac disease (associated with a genetic difference). But I have noticed clear improvements in brain function (measured by arithmetic speed or something similar) after eating something sweet, such as pudding. None of this, unfortunately, helps answer the question: how low blood sugar is too low?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22633797">A new study</a> makes more plausible the idea that really low levels of carbs may be bad for you:</p>
<blockquote><p>A nested case-control study data set was generated from the cohort-study data set (n = 4140 type 2 diabetic outpatients) by sampling controls from the risk sets. Cases (n = 427) were compared with an equal number of controls chosen from those members of the cohort who were at risk for the same follow-up time of the case, matched for age (Â±3 years), sex, body mass index (BMI) (Â±2 kg m(-2)), duration of diabetes (Â±5 years), and Charlson&#8217;s Comorbidity Score (CCS) (Â±1). The main predefined analysis was the comparison of cases and controls for proportion of patients with each HbA1c class (<6.5%, 6.5-7.4%, 7.5-8.4% and â¥8.5%). During a mean follow-up of 5.7 Â± 3.5 years, 427 deaths were recorded. The lowest risk of death was observed in the HbA1c 6.5-7.4% category; <strong>a lower HbA1c was associated with a non-significant trend towards a higher risk. The risk associated with a low (<6.5%) HbA1c was significantly greater in patients who were insulin-treated than in the rest of the sample.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The study is saying that diabetic patients in the HbA1c 6.5-7.4% category do not improve their health when given insulin that lowers their blood sugar even more. Their health may get worse.</p>

					<p>How much can you help yourself by getting your genome sequenced? A lot, a little, not at all? <strong>Scenario 1</strong> (big help): You discover you have a greatly elevated risk of Disease X. You do various things to reduce that risk that actually reduce it. <strong>Scenario 2</strong>: (a little help): You discover you have a greatly elevated risk of Rare Disease X. You do various things to reduce that risk but they don&#8217;t help. At least, when Disease X starts, you will be less upset. <strong>Scenario 3</strong> (no help): You discover that you have a greatly elevated risk for a common easily-noticed disease (such as obesity). You already watched your weight, this changes nothing. <strong>Scenario 4</strong> (harm): You discover that you have a greatly elevated risk of Scary Disease X (e.g., bipolar disorder). It is depressing news. Later studies show that the gene/disease association was a mistake. (Many gene/disease associations have failed to replicate.)</p>
<p><a href="http://genomera.com/downloads/genomera_201103_wired.pdf">A recent <em>Wired</em> article</a> tries to answer this question for one person: Raymond McCauley, a bioinformatics scientist who had his genome sequenced four years ago and learned he was &#8220;four or five times more likely than most people to develop age-related macular degeneration (AMD)&#8221;. The article says &#8220;of all the ailments described in the 23andme profile, AMD has one of the strongest genetic associations&#8221;. If I found this in my genetic profile, I would want to know the confidence interval of the increased risk. Is it a factor of 4.5 plus or minus 1? Or 4.5 plus or minus 8? This isn&#8217;t easy to figure out. In addition to the question of variability, there can easily be bias (= estimate is too high). Let&#8217;s say I do 100 gene/disease association studies. Then I scan these studies to pick the one with the strongest gene/disease association. It should be obvious that this particular association is likely to be too high and, depending on the details, could plausibly be pure chance (i.e., true association is zero).Â  I have been unable to find out how replicable the gene/AMD association is. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration">Wikipedia</a>, &#8220;the lifetime risk of developing late-stage macular degeneration is 50% for people that have a relative with macular degeneration, versus 12% for people that do not have relatives with macular degeneration.&#8221; (Until it was eliminated via better diet, pellagra also ran in families.) The <em>Wired</em> article does not say whether any of McCauley&#8217;s relatives have/had AMD &#8212; a huge omission, given the uncertainty of gene/disease associations.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t obvious what McCauley should do, according to the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>McCauley read that there were a few preventative measures he could take to reduce the chances of AMD one day rendering him blind: don&#8217;t smoke and avoid ultraviolet light, for instance. Also, it seemed, he could try taking a special combination of vitamins, including B12 and lutein. But when he consulted the research, he could find little evidence to support the effectiveness of the regime, based on his genotype.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article says nothing about quitting smoking but he does wear glasses that reduce ultraviolet light and takes certain vitamins. It is very hard for him to determine whether they help.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110314163439.htm">Here</a> is a study that found greater omega-3 consumption associated with lower risk of AMD. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080229140218.htm">Here</a> is a study that found AMD associated with inflammation (too little omega-3 increases inflammation). <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071008171034.htm">Here</a> is a study that found no association between vitamin and mineral intake and AMD. Based on this, if 23andme told me I had an increased risk of AMD, I would make sure to optimize my intake of flaxseed oil (or other omega-3 source) using some sort of brain test.<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/"> I have documented in other posts that brain function is sensitive to omega-3 intake</a> and (probably) most people don&#8217;t get enough. Of course, just as it is foolish to smoke (a lot) regardless of whether you have genetic risk of AMD, it is foolish to not optimize one&#8217;s omega-3 intake, whether or not you have genetic risk of AMD. In other words: everyone should optimize their omega-3 intake.Â  If the 23andme results cause McCauley to do something wise like this that he would otherwise not have done, they have helped him.</p>
<p>The omega-3 study appeared after the <em>Wired</em> article so I don&#8217;t know how McCauley reacted to it. A puzzle about theÂ  story is that it isn&#8217;t even clear that the gene/AMD associations are true. Consider McCauley&#8217;s older relatives: parents, grandparents. Did/do any of them have AMD? If not, it is more plausible that all of them were at 12% risk of the disease than at 50% risk. Suppose all of them had, according to 23andme, the same increased risk as McCauley (at least some of them have the risk-bearing genes). Now it becomes more plausible that something is wrong with the 23andme risk estimate. If some of McCauley&#8217;s older relatives <strong>do</strong> have AMD, it is not clear why the 23andme results would make much difference. He should have already have known he was at increased risk of AMD.</p>
<p>The upshot is that in this particular case, I cannot even rule out Scenario 4 (does harm). All four scenarios strike me as plausible.Â  Based on this article, we are a long way from learning the value of personal genomics.</p>
<p>Previously I used <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/05/my-porphyria-went-away/">the example of Aaron Blaisdell</a> to make the possibly counter-intuitive point that <em>if you have a genetic disease something is wrong with your environment</em>. Well, I do not have any obvious genetic disease. But I discovered, via self-experimentation, that my environment was <em>terrible</em> &#8212; meaning it could be improved in all sorts of ways: stop eating breakfast, drink flaxseed oil, eat butter, look at faces in the morning, take Vitamin D in the morning, and so on, not to mention eat fermented foods (which I figured out via psychology, not self-experimentation). My findings about what is optimal are so different than the way anyone now lives (except people who read this blog) that I believe <em>everyone</em>&#8216;s environment can be vastly improved. If so, the value of discovering you have a genetically elevated risk of this or that is not obvious &#8212; you should <em>already</em> be trying to improve your environment. At least that is what my data has taught me. On the other hand, maybe genetic info (even wrong genetic info!) will give you a kick in the pants. Maybe that has happened with McCauley.</p>

				<small>Monday, May 14th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Parkinson&#8217;s disease often runs in families and <a href="http://p973.ccmu.edu.cn/4-zuixinjinzhan/2/15.pdf">some of the genes responsible have been identified</a>. One is called PINK1. <a href="http://www.vib.be/en/news/Pages/Vitamin-K2-new-hope-for-Parkinson-patients.aspx">A new fruit fly model</a> uses fruit flies with a similar genetic defect.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patrik Verstreken and his team used fruitflies with a genetic defect in PINK1 or Parkin that is similar to the one associated with Parkinson&#8217;s. They found that the flies with a PINK1 or Parkin mutation lost their ability to fly.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, they discovered that the mitochondria in these flies were defective, just as in Parkinson&#8217;s patients.Â  Because of this they generated less intracellular energy â energy the insects needed to fly. When the flies were given vitamin K2, the energy production in their mitochondria was restored and the insectsâ ability to fly improved. The researchers were also able to determine that the energy production was restored because the vitamin K2 had improved electron transport in the mitochondria.Â  This in turn led to improved energy production.</p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious conclusion is that some Parkinson&#8217;s patients may benefit from eating more Vitamin K2. Less obvious and less certain is that our diets contained more K2 in the past (so that the various genes that now cause Parkinson&#8217;s were rendered harmless).Â  Warren Buffet <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/9609521?story_id=9609521">famously said</a> about risk exposure: &#8220;&#8221;It&#8217;s only when the tide goes out that you learn who&#8217;s been swimming naked&#8221;. Likewise, changes in diet (such as reduction in K2 intake) expose disease-causing genes. I have made this point <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/04/05/my-porphyria-went-away/">several times</a>. It is counter-intuitive that disease-gene linkages suggest bad environmental changes.</p>

<p>Long ago, in the civil rights or suffrage movements, for example, empowerment meant removal of barriers. This organization preaches empowerment by creation of barriers. Their empowerment is someone else&#8217;s disempowerment.</p>

					<p>A few months ago I blogged that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/30/an-unbiassed-view-of-what-we-should-eat/">a rat had persuaded me to eat more eggs</a>.Â  This particular rat liked scrambled eggs. Rats are omnivores, like humans. Unlike humans, they ignore advertising, nutrition fads and disinformation. Related to this, <a href="http://www.tuckermax.com/">Tucker Max</a> emailed me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Have you thought about eating your egg raw? It sounded weird to me at first, but after looking extensively into it, there was a lot of good evidence that cooking an egg destroys a lot of theÂ beneficial nutrients/enzymes in it.Â Once I started doing this, I noticed a HUGE increase in energy from the egg. It was like I almost eating a different food. In fact, the very first time I did it was at night, like 9pm, and I couldn&#8217;t get to sleep until 3am I had such a huge burst of energy. It&#8217;s not quite like that anymore, but I take it about an hour or two before I work out, and its like taking a red bull (I may be a bit vitamin B12 deficient, which would explain this).</p>
<p>As to how I do it, I just crack the egg into a coffee cup, and swallow it whole. It has pretty much no flavor. I also only do it with organic pasture-raised eggs. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d do this with normal, crappy store bought eggs.</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>On my blog I said that butter and egg were in that way different from other foods &#8212; butter or at least milk must be a complete nutrient since it is the only food the baby gets. Other foods are under no such evolutionary pressure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tucker replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which is why its SO important to get raw milk/butter from grassfed cows. Almost a completely different food than normal grocery store milk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. When I get back to California I will compare raw and cooked eggs. In Beijing I eat mainly fermented eggs.</p>

<blockquote><p>I was doing SLD using flax seed oil for two weeks before my last dental appointment.Â  My pockets that were 4&#8242;s and 5&#8243;s magically changed to 2&#8242;s and 3&#8243;s.Â  I had my dentist print both the reports because <strong>I was so grateful that they stopped talking about some really painful sounding root work</strong>.Â  My brushing and flossing were totally unchanged.Â  I was expecting the result because of what I&#8217;ve read on the blog, but <strong>nothing this good</strong>.Â  I am convinced that taking flax=reduction in gum inflammation, at the very least.

<p>Take that, &#8220;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer">decline effect</a>&#8221; (big experimental effects, when the experiment is repeated, get smaller)!</p>
<p>TheÂ  commenter sent me the records of the two cleanings. At the pre-flaxseed-oil cleaning (April 28, 2011), he had 24 sites (13 teeth) with pockets of depth 4 or 5. At the cleaning after he started flaxseed oil (July 28, 2011), he had no sites with pockets of depth 4 or 5.</p>

				<small>Thursday, January 5th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Epidemiology has lots of critics.<em></em> In <a href="http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/epidemi-reviews.htm">this article</a>, for example, it is called &#8220;lying on a grand scale.&#8221; Every critique I have read has ignored history. Epidemiologists have been right about two major issues: 1. Heavy smoking causes lung cancer. 2. Folate deficiency causes birth defects. In both cases, the first evidence was epidemiological. Another example is John Snow&#8217;s conclusion about the value of clean water. In my experience, epidemiologists often overstate the strength of their evidence (as do most of us) but overstatement is quite different from having nothing worth saying.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example. Many people think osteoporosis is due to lack of calcium. Bones are made of calcium, right? The epidemiology of hip fractures is clear. In spite of the conventional idea, the rate of hip fracture has been <strong>highest</strong> in places where people eat a lot of calcium, such as Sweden, and <strong>lowest</strong> in places where they eat little, such as Hong Kong. (<a href="http://mydrmo.com/2011/10/got-milk-the-truth-about-osteoporosis-calcium-dairy-products/">For example</a>.) In other words, the epidemiology flatly contradicted the conventional idea. This was apparently ignored by nutrition experts (<em>everyone knows correlation does not equal causation</em>) who advised millions of people, especially women, to take calcium supplementsÂ  to avoid osteoporosis. Millions of people followed (and follow) that advice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21505219">Thanks to a recent meta-analysis<em></em></a> we now know that experiments and better data firmly support the earlier epidemiology, which suggested that calcium supplements are dangerous. Here are its main conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p>In meta-analyses of placebo controlled trials of calcium or calcium and vitamin D, complete trial-level data were available for 28,072 participants from eight trials of calcium supplements and the WHI CaD participants not taking personal calcium supplements. . . .Calcium or calcium and vitamin D increased the risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.24 (1.07 to 1.45), P = 0.004) and the composite of myocardial infarction or stroke (1.15 (1.03 to 1.27), P = 0.009). . . . A reassessment of the role of calcium supplements in osteoporosis management is warranted.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the epidemiology had been taken more seriously, many heart attacks might have been avoided.</p>
<p>Is this an &#8220;anecdote&#8221; &#8212; a single example &#8212; proving nothing? Here&#8217;s how you can check. Randomly select a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies. Thousands have been done. Then ask if the results summarized in the meta-analysis appear random. Better yet, randomly pick two meta-analyses. Suppose the first summarizes 5 studies and the second summarizes 6. If the 11 results were shuffled together, how well could you assign them correctly?</p>

Contrary to what the researcher quoted in this article says, there is already substantial evidence that selenium reduces cancer risk. For example, in a county-by-county map of USA cancer rates, there is a clear rift in the north east. On one side of the rift rates are clearly higher than on the other side of the rift. The rift corresponds to geological fault line. On the low-cancer side of the rift, there is more selenium in the soil. There are also rat experiments. You certainly should take selenium supplements.</li>
<li>American health care plays a surprisingly large role in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/09/120109fa_fact_hessler">an excellent story</a> by Peter Hessler in <em>The New Yorker</em> about the Japanese <em>yakuza</em> (mafia). 1. From 2000 to 2004, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-5484118.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody">four <em>yakuza</em> members got liver transplants at UCLA</a> at a time when liver transplants were hard to get. A few months later they made large donations to UCLA. The money went into a general fund at the surgery department. According to a UCLA spokesperson, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ucla31-2008may31,0,1503718.story">there was no connection</a> between the transplants and the donations. According to <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/statement-on-ucla-s-organ-transplantation-111951.aspx">a UCLA press release</a>, &#8220;No money or donation was offered or paid to anyone at UCLA as a quid pro quo for getting a transplant or moving up on the list.&#8221; Because a general fund is not a person, this is literally true. 2. In the early 1990s, at a Columbia, Missouri hospital, a nurse was suspected of killing patients. Hospital administrators covered it up. &#8220;Everyone took part in the coverup was promoted, everybody who tried to expose it was punished,&#8221; said someone who tried to expose it.</li>

				<small>Saturday, December 31st, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A blog called <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/">Adventures in Nutritional Therapy</a> (started March 2011) is about what the author learned while trying to solve her health problems via nutrition and a few other things. She usually assumed her health problems were due to too much or too little of some nutrient. She puts it like this: &#8220;using mostly non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) supplements and treatments to address depression, brain fog, insomnia, migraines, hypothyroidism, restless legs, carpal tunnel syndrome, and a bunch of other annoyances.&#8221; In contrast to what &#8220;the American medical establishment&#8221; advises. Mostly it is nutritional self-experimentation about a wide range of health problems.</p>
<p>Interesting things I learned from the archives:</p>
<p>1. Question: Did Lance Armstrong take performance-enhancing drugs? I learned that LiveStrong (Armstrong&#8217;s site) is a content farm. Now answer that question again.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;If you return repeatedly to a conventional doctor with a problem they canât solve, they will eventually suggest you need antidepressants.&#8221;</p>
<p>3.Â  &#8220;When I mentioned [to Dr. CFS] the mild success Iâd had with zinc, he said it was in my mind: I wanted it to work and it did. When I pointed out that 70% of the things I tried didnât work, he changed the subject. Dr. CFSâ lack of basic reasoning skills did nothing to rebuild my confidence in the health care system.&#8221; Quite right. I have had the same experience. Most things I tried failed. When something finally worked, it could hardly be a placebo effect. This line of reasoning has been difficult for some supposedly smart people to grasp.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/04/the-story-of-the-end-of-my-depression/">A list of things that helped her with depression</a>. &#8220;Quit gluten&#8221; is number one.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">Pepsi caused her to get acne</a>. Same here.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">100 mg/day of iron caused terrible acne</a> that persisted for weeks after she stopped taking the iron.</p>
<p>7. &#8220;<a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/08/abdominal-pain/">In September 2008</a> I started a journey that serves as a good example of the limits of the American health care system, where you can go through three months, 15 doctor visits, $7,000 in medical tests, three prescriptions and five over-the-counter medications trying to treat your abdominal pain, and after you lose ten pounds due to said pain, you are asked by the âspecialistsâ if you have an eating disorder.&#8221; I agree. Also an example of the inability of people within the American health care system to see those limits.Â  If they recognized that people outside their belief system might have something valuable to contribute, apparently something awful would happen.</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/07/six-weeks-of-sciatica/">Acupuncture relieved her sciatica</a>, but not for long. &#8220;By the time I left [the acupuncturist's office] the pain was gone, but it crept back during my 30-minute drive home.&#8221;</p>
<p>9. Pointing out many wrongs does not equal a right. She praises <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/09/sugar-bitter-pill-video/">a talk by Robert Lustig</a> about evil fructose. I am quite sure that fructose (by itself) did not cause the obesity epidemic. For one thing, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I lost a lot of weight by drinking it</a>. (<a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">Here is an advanced discussion</a>.) In other words, being a good critic of other people&#8217;s work (as Lustig may be) doesn&#8217;t get you very far. I think it is hard for non-scientists (and even some scientists) to understand that all scientific work has dozens of &#8220;flaws&#8221;. Pointing out the flaws in this or that is little help, unless those flaws haven&#8217;t been noticed. What usually helps isn&#8217;t seeing flaws, it is seeing what can be learned.</p>
<p>10. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/06/headaches-and-migraines/">A list of what caused headaches and migraines</a>. One was MSG. Another was Vitamin D3, because it made her Vitamin B1 level too low.</p>
<p>She is a good writer. Mostly I found support for my beliefs: 1. Of the two aspects of self-experimentation (measure, change),Â  change is more powerful. She does little or no self-trackingÂ  (= keeping records) as far as I could tell, yet has made a lot of progress. She has done a huge amount of trying different things. 2. Nutritional deficiencies cause a lot of problems. 3. Fermented food is overlooked. She never tries it, in spite of major digestive problems. She does try probiotics. 4. American health care is exceedingly messed-up. As she puts it, &#8220;the American medical establishment has no interest in this approach [which often helped her] and, when they do deign to discuss it, don&#8217;t know what the #%@! they&#8217;re talking about.&#8221; 5. &#8220;Over the years I&#8217;ve found accounts of personal experiences to be very helpful.&#8221; I agree. Her blog and mine are full of them.</p>
<p>Thanks to Alexandra Carmichael.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/12/self-experimenters-scientific-american/">Her latest post</a> mentions me (&#8220;The fella after my own heart is Seth Roberts, who after ten years of experimenting . . . &#8220;). I was unaware of that when I wrote the above.</p>
