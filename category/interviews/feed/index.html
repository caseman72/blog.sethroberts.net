				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://zeynepton.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Good Jobs Strategy</em></a> by Zeynep Ton, published in January, argues that retailers should change low-level jobs in four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer fewer choices &#8212; fewer versions of each product.</li>
<li>Standardize common tasks and empower employees to handle unusual situations.</li>
<li>Cross-train employees so that each employee can do several jobs.</li>
<li>Operate with slack, that is, hire more employees than seemingly necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The brilliance of this book is that it addresses a major problem (bad jobs), includes substantial evidence and persuasive argument, is practical, and is exceedingly non-obvious (judging by how many retailers already follow her recommendations). Ton is an MIT business school professor whose area of expertise is operations.</p>
<p>I interviewed her by email.<span id="more-13027"></span></p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> How did you get into studying this? My impression is that the details of how employees are treated is not what operations professors usually study.</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> Early in my career I studied pervasive operational problems at retail stores that hurt supply chain and financial performance. My doctoral thesis was on misplaced products and the resulting phantom stockouts. I found that even retailers that were great at managing the backend of their supply chain, by getting the right products to the right stores at the right time, were pretty bad at managing the last ten yards of their supply chain. Once the products made it to the store, they would stay in the backroom or in the wrong place and often not meet the customer that wanted to buy them.</p>
<p>Problems like misplaced products were common, frequent, and had a huge impact on customer service, sales, and profits. When I studied what drove these problems I found that stores that had more workload for employees, lower training, and more employee turnover had worse performance.</p>
<p>Things really clicked for me several years ago when I was presenting my research to a group of retail managers and executives. I showed them my findings from analyzing a lot of data from Borders that showed that if stores increased the amount of people they would make more money. This finding just didn’t make sense—why would managers staff their stores with too few people even though having more would increase profits? When I asked people in the audience to raise their hands if I would find a similar result if I analyzed data from their chain, almost all raised their hands.</p>
<p>What I saw was that a lot of retailers were operating in what I call a vicious cycle. Low investment in employees caused operational problems, which reduced customer service, sales, and profits. When stores had low sales and profits, they had low labor budgets, which further reduced their investment in employees.</p>
<p>Everybody suffers from this vicious cycle. Employees have bad jobs, customer get bad service, and investors are worse off because there is a lot of money left at the table. I thought there have to be some companies that operate much better. That’s how I started looking at firms that follow the good jobs strategy.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> How have your ideas on this subject changed over the years?</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> There was a period when I wasn’t sure if excellence was possible in low-cost retail. All the examples around me were of retailers that offered bad jobs and had poor operational performance. When I went to Spain to study Mercadona I realized that I finally had found the “Toyota Production System” of retailing. What really excited me was studying QuikTrip after Mercadona. Here were two completely different companies—the largest supermarket chain in Spain and a convenience store chain with gas stations based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Yet they were both beating their competitors by offering much better jobs than their competitors. At the same time they were both offering low prices and great service to their customers.</p>
<p>When I looked into what allowed them to deliver value to their employees, customers, and investors at the same time, I saw that they were both excellent operators. They were both making a set of operational choices that reduced costs, increased employee productivity, and allowed employees to have a big role in driving profits. When I looked at Costco and Trader Joe’s, I saw they were making the same choices. In my book I highlight the four choices I observed [shared by these four companies].</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> When you present these ideas to retailers, what is their reaction? Of course there is a range of reactions, but which reactions surprised you the most? Which reactions did you learn the most from?</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> The reaction that I learned most from is the following. When Marshall Fisher, a Wharton professor and a thought leader in operations management, presented his finding that retailers could make more money by increasing staffing levels, a CEO said, &#8220;I spend my days saying no to a long line of people suggesting ways to spend money, including adding more staff. I don&#8217;t need a couple of Ivy League professors with their fancy statistical analysis giving them more ammunition!&#8221;</p>
<p>This really shows how retailers view their labor — as a cost to be minimized.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px;">ROBERTS </strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">What do you think about how Amazon treats employees? Do you have any suggestions for them? [The book is published by Amazon.]</span></p>
<p><strong>TON </strong>I have not studied Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> Your book lacked a chapter called &#8220;What Happens When&#8230;&#8221; about what happens when companies try to implement the changes you suggest &#8212; I mean, make changes based on your research. Can you say anything about that?</p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> Of the four model retailers that follow the good jobs strategy, only one went through a dramatic change. Mercadona started as a company that operated just like most companies operate right now, but had to change in order to compete against much larger companies. I hope that my book will encourage more companies to adopt a good jobs strategy. If I can observe some of these changes, I will be in a better position to offer suggestions for implementation.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>ROBERTS</strong> It seems to me the underlying theme of your book is &#8220;Look, your employees have brains. The more you take advantage of those brains, the better off everyone &#8212; you, them, owners, customers &#8212; will be.&#8221; Is that a fair summary?</span></p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> One could say that the book is about designing the work that employees do to leverage committed, motivated, and capable employees. It’s also about making smart operational choices that benefit employees, customers, and investors at the same time.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px;">ROBERTS </strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Do you have a theory &#8212; is there a theory &#8212; that ties your four suggestions (&#8220;operational choices&#8221;) together? Is there an underlying principle from which all four of them can be deduced?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>TON </strong>The four choices I observed are choices that operationally excellent companies have been making for decades and they could be traced to lean manufacturing. Overall, the good jobs strategy—the combination of the four choices and investment in people—is a blueprint for operational excellence.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px;">ROBERTS</strong><span style="font-size: 13px;"> Why has it been hard to learn to make the choices you describe?</span></p>
<p><strong>TON</strong> Unfortunately, the dominant view in business is that paying employees as little as possible and treating them as a cost to be minimized is the best and perhaps only way to run a profitable business, especially in industries with low profit margins.</p>
<p>As I show in my book, that’s not the only way and that’s not even the best way.</p>
<p>But companies can make bad choices just like people can make bad choices. We know exercising is great for our health but regular exercise requires commitment, discipline, hard work and a long-term view. The good jobs strategy is good for companies’ health but that too requires commitment, discipline, hard work, and long-term view.</p>
<p>Excellence is always harder to achieve than mediocrity. And right now we have too many companies stuck in mediocrity.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>You say &#8220;the dominant view in business is that paying employees as little as possible and treating them as a cost to be minimized is the best and perhaps only way to run a profitable business, especially in industries with low profit margins.&#8221; That is a common-sense view that Adam Smith might have expounded. Why has such a wrong view persisted so long? On the face of it, I would think that how to treat employees would be one of the central questions that business professors (and CEOs) try to answer and nobody would be satisfied with repeating ideas of several hundred years ago. It&#8217;s one thing for a third grade teacher to tell students &#8220;the earth is flat&#8221; &#8212; yes, it looks vaguely flat. But for sophisticated university professors and captains of industry to say &#8220;the earth is flat&#8221; for hundreds of years when there is a vast amount of money to be made from realizing it isn&#8217;t flat, that is puzzling.</p>
<p><strong>TON  </strong>But it&#8217;s not just ignorance. Perhaps I should have worded it differently.  Following the good jobs strategy is not easy. You have to get many things right.  It requires excellence.</p>
<p><strong>POSTSCRIPT </strong>This is what Ton said in the book &#8212; that the good jobs strategy is difficult. I wasn&#8217;t persuaded. CEOs of major retailers have done many things that are not easy. Why has this difficult thing been out of reach?</p>
<p>I suspect an examination of why the 4 retailers Ton study broke from the pack and treated their employees differently would not find that the people in charge were more capable of excellence than the leaders of other companies. Maybe their personalities were different, maybe their cultures (internal company culture or external society culture) were different, I have no idea.</p>
<p>I am unsurprised that business profs had failed to figure out what Ton figured out (although her conclusions are supported by the work of other professors). Other disciplines have enormous blind spots &#8212; epidemiologists never study the immune system, for example. The more things you can take for granted, such as the idea that labor is a cost to be minimized, the easier it is to publish papers. In academia what is rewarded and selected for is not solving real problems, it is publishing papers in prestigious journals, which is quite different.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In response to allegations that Terry Deacon, a Berkeley professor, plagiarized from Alicia Juarrero, a professor at <a href="http://www.pgcc.edu/" target="_blank">a community college</a>, UC Berkeley created <a href="http://terrydeacon.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">a website</a> that (among other things) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/02/03/new-terry-deacon-website/" target="_blank">tried to smear Michael Lissack</a>, one of the accusers. Less obvious is that the committee that investigated the allegations ignored their core: The overlap with Juarrero is relentless. It goes on and on. Juarrero explained this to me when I asked her what she thought of <a href="http://terrydeacon.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/docs/deacon.report.pdf" target="_blank">the committee report</a>:</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m disappointed, but not surprised. Not sure what the difference is between &#8220;reckless&#8221; (which their definition of plagiarism includes) and &#8220;negligent&#8221; (which they critiqued as a &#8220;novel interpretation&#8221; of plagiarism). I&#8217;ll tell you how my <em>cri de coeur</em> spreadsheet came about: as I read Deacon [<em>Incomplete Nature</em>] I got angrier and angrier, so I decided to start the spreadsheet. The index in my own book [<em>Dynamics in Action</em>] is very bad (my fault, my inexperience) and so I was having a hard time finding the parallel material in my own work. I knew I had said something to that effect somewhere in the book but couldn&#8217;t remember where and couldn&#8217;t find the entry in my own index. But suddenly, a pattern emerged: All I had to do was read on a few pages or paragraphs further down from the previous &#8220;problem,&#8221; and there would be the next item. This happened over and over again in huge chunks of the work (which I highlighted to point out the big chunks of seriatim similarities) &#8212; it&#8217;s the seriatimness (!) that&#8217;s so damning and to me, clear evidence this wasn&#8217;t just someone who vaguely remembered what I had said in a talk and then reconstructed the ideas for himself. The sheer number and sequential nature of the similarities are just too improbable to be a coincidence, or two people working in the same field. He was quite clever about it. He hid it with neologisms, talking about whole-part instead of top-down causality, insisting that self-organization is not enough (and then turning around in advocating it), etc. And, of course, not discussing intentional action, which is the explicit subject of my book.<span id="more-9241"></span></p>
<p>The spreadsheet for <em>Dynamics in Action</em> and <em>Incomplete Nature</em> is on my website, <a href="http://www.aliciajuarrero.com" target="_blank">www.aliciajuarrero.com</a>. It was the seriatim nature of the parallels that really got to me and made me complain to Norton and UC Berkeley &#8212; anyone can discuss two or three of the same authors; or two or three of the same themes, or use two or three of the same examples; but that many, in pretty much the same order? The examples UCB picks (Benard cells, whirlpools) are indeed standard ones and if these were the only ones there would be no case. It&#8217;s the cumulative impact that makes the case, in my opinion. The comments that I really object to in the report are &#8220;The idea that it is possible to reconceptualize teleology in terms of dynamical systems theory has been discussed and developed by many theorists&#8221; and &#8220;The connection between ideas about self-organization and ideas from thermodynamics and information theory has been made by many writers in this area&#8230;&#8221; The UCB report should have cited sources and dates. Simply to state, &#8220;is not in our view original to Juarrero&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;we see no evidence that Deacon&#8217;s use&#8230; shows any influence of Juarrero&#8217;s&#8221; simply begs the question.</p>
<p>Re the Kant &amp; Self-organization piece: it&#8217;s true that everyone seems to be mentioning Kant in this connection (as if folks commonly read the Third Critique where Kant discusses this stuff). I suspect Deacon got this reference from his buddy Stu Kauffman (I would bet the rent Deacon didn&#8217;t read the Third Critique!) &#8212; but at least Kauffman included me in his bibliography, if not in the footnotes. But I don&#8217;t think Deacon could have afforded to include DiA in the bibliography &#8212; there&#8217;s just too much of <em>Dynamics in Action</em> in <em>Incomplete Nature</em> &#8211; he just hoped no one would catch the parallels with a community college professor who published 10 years ago. As a philosopher I probably would never have read <em>Incomplete Nature</em> &#8212; but then I saw the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> review and the ideas sounded awfully familiar&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to put the two works side by side and let readers judge for themselves.</p>
<p><em>How did Michael Lissack get involved?</em></p>
<p>First contact I had with him was in 2000, when he phoned my house to ask, &#8220;Is the phone ringing off the hook because of the book?&#8221; My answer: No, it isn&#8217;t, who are you? He invited me to give a talk at his ISCE <span style="font-size: 13px;">[Institute for the Study of Coherence and Emergence] </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">institute in Boston that year, and then invited me to be on the ISCE board. He also became a one-man publicity campaign for </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">Dynamics in Action</em><span style="font-size: 13px;">, including a long discussion about it with Kauffman, Deacon and Evan Thompson at Esalen in 2003. They spent hours discussing it. Which reminds me: Evan Thompson published a review in </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">Nature</em><span style="font-size: 13px;"> in December 2011 in which he explicitly states that Deacon failed to cite him &#8212; and me. And Colin McGinn (whom I&#8217;ve never met), really lit into Deacon in the </span><em style="font-size: 13px;">New York Review of Books</em><span style="font-size: 13px;"> in June 2012. None of this was mentioned in the UCB report, which makes it appear that Deacon&#8217;s just the victim of a witch hunt by Lissack, Rubino and me.</span></p>
<p>ISCE was the publisher for the Rubino-Juarrero anthology on Emergence that&#8217;s in question with the Deacon-Cashman article, so I think Michael feels ISCE organization is indirectly compromised by this mess &#8212; but it&#8217;s mostly that he has never seen a fight he&#8217;s run away from.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I asked Mark Qualls, a 59-year-old truck driver who lives in Longmont, Colorado, about his success with the Shangri-La Diet, which <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8231.msg105461#msg105461">he posted about</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How did you learn about it?</strong></p>
<p>Freakonomics.  When I read about you in that book, it made sense to me. The whole idea of a setpoint. I used to be an accountant. I weighed 290 pounds. I&#8217;m 6&#8242; 2&#8243;. I lost 25 pounds when I started driving a truck. I&#8217;ve been there for almost 12 years. Around 260. I get a lot of exercise delivering groceries. I can eat anything I want but the idea of going on a diet makes me hungry.  My doctor said lose a bit of weight but I just couldn’t do it.<span id="more-6402"></span></p>
<p><strong>How do you do the diet?</strong></p>
<p>I use canola oil. I tried flax seed oil but it has a horrible taste. I have no problem taking the oil. I feel like I could do the oil for the rest of my life. At least 4 tablespoons per day. I don’t measure it. I have a jar by a sink at home, another in my truck. I take a sip, what seems about a tablespoon. I figure I’m getting at least 4 tablespoons per day.  Some days I may get only 3 tablespoons.</p>
<p><strong>What effect has it had?</strong></p>
<p>I feel like I’m in control. I stopped drinking sweet tea, used to drink tons of it. For 20 years. I’ve been able to stop. I couldn’t stand drinking water. Now that’s all I drink. That’s all I’ve had for two months. The most bizarre thing to me in the world. I deliver to convenience stores. All they have is soda pop and doughntuts and all that kind of stuff. I’d stop and have a doughnut and chocolate milk. Now I can go without it. I still think about it but now I can say  no.</p>
<p><strong>What about weight loss</strong>?</p>
<p>I’m down from 255 to 229 – a little over 2 months. I don’t really try that hard. I pretty much eat what I want. On two days per week I try to eat hardly anything. Unless I almost eat nothing, I stay at the same weight. It’s not hard to do it – to eat almost nothing. Almost any time of day or night I think “I could eat something”. But then it’s okay not to. It gives you willpower – that’s how I explain it to people. Find the book and read the whole thing, I tell them. They need to understand the whole concept before they start taking oil.</p>
<p><strong>Any downsides?</strong></p>
<p>Eating is enjoyable to me. My mom is a great cook. My wife is a great cook. I like to eat. It’s emotionally satisfying thing to eat stuff. But when I take the oil I can not eat.  Now I eat slower. To try to enjoy the little bit of food you do it. You’re not going to eat 3 more times today. I tell myself, I’m going to enjoy every bite of this cottage cheese. Because that’s all I’m going to eat today. The social part I miss. It’s a social part of your life that you don’t have any more. Most of the time I’ve gone to eat with people since I started, I go ahead and eat something because I don’t want to be a jerk about it. I still lose weight. That will be a day where I don’t lose weight when I go out to eat. To lose weight I have to have a day when I don’t eat anything. Today is a day where I told myself I want to lose 1 more pound. I ate breakfast with a friend,. There’s nobody who expects me to eat with them. My wife’s away.</p>
<p><strong>How do other people react?</strong></p>
<p>My wife’s a skeptic about the whole thing. She doesn’t think I can’t keep the weight off. One lady at church, she got the book right away. She’d lost 50 pounds eating 1000 calories per day. She started the oil. She’s gung ho about it. We see each other Sunday:<em> how much did you lose this week?</em> we ask.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wondered if <a href="http://about.me/vlaskovits">Patrick Vlaskovits</a>, who runs the question-answer site<a href="http://PaleoHacks.com"> PaleoHacks</a>, could shed some light on the recent growth of interest in a Paleo approach to health.  So I asked him a few questions. <span id="more-2238"></span></p>
<p>SETH What have you learned from PaleoHacks about the growth of the Paleo movement during the last year?</p>
<p>PATRICK Well, one thing is certain &#8230; the Paleo movement IS growing.  One can look at various proxies for this &#8212; Google Trends &#8211; for example &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=paleo+diet" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/trends?q=paleo+diet</a> &#8212; or more frequent mentions in the mainstream media.  But your question is about what I have learned from PaleoHacks.com with regard to growth. PaleoHacks.com&#8217;s traffic is definitely growing and my sense is that Paleo (by that I mean eating in an evolutionarily appropriate manner) is about to cross the chasm into the mainstream.</p>
<p>A few interesting measures of growth vis-a-vis PaleoHacks are:</p>
<p>1)  The increasing frequency of meta-discussions on PaleoHacks &#8211;people who have been eating Paleo for some time are now looking to the future about what it means to be &#8220;Paleo&#8221; and how long-time Paleo eaters are changing their Paleo diets. This is, IMO, is a good thing as Keynes said:  &#8221;When the facts change, I change my mind &#8212; what do you do, sir?&#8221;  We are learning more about how our health changes after some time eating Paleo &#8211; and what needs to be fine-tuned when it comes to things like bacterial/gut health (probably the most important thing to worry about) and hormonal changes relative to our environment, e.g. cortisol levels increasing due to lack of sleep which can result in unwanted/unhealthy weight gain or weight loss.</p>
<p>2)  More people are blogging about Paleo and also more people are trying to monetize Paleo and I see them on PaleoHacks.  (For the record, I have no problem with anyone trying to monetize Paleo as long as they are responsible about it as I feel that anyone monetizing Paleo should also be a good steward of Paleo.)</p>
<p>SETH How much has PaleoHacks traffic grown over the last year?</p>
<p>PATRICK  Short answer:  A lot. Longer answer:  Depends on which metric you use &#8212; but still a lot. Ranges from 6x to 8x YOY increase in visits, uniques and page-views. Currently, PaleoHacks gets +500k page-views a month.  [I double-checked my internal stats with public information on Compete.com &amp; Quantcast - and it looks like they undercount (BTW this is a well-known and hotly debated topic).]</p>
<p>SETH What do you think is causing such fast growth? The broad idea is really  old. Even the details are old &#8212; Weston Price wrote in the 1930s, for  example. The Weston Price Foundation, which was started many years ago,  is growing much more slowly.</p>
<p>PATRICK  Cutting to the chase: no idea.  Some thoughts:</p>
<p>Paleo&#8217;s growth appears highly correlated with CrossFit &#8212; but what has caused CrossFit&#8217;s growth?  Not sure.  It too has been around a while.</p>
<p>Social media have certainly accelerated/lubricated Paleo&#8217;s growth but I don&#8217;t if social media actually *caused* Paleo&#8217;s growth.  What causes memes like Paleo to spark, and then die out or go dormant and then spark again to grow into a raging wildfire?  I wish I knew.</p>
<p>Getting a little meta and perhaps off-topic &#8212; my assumption is that is true for most &#8220;Big Ideas&#8221;.  We rarely recognize or know of their true &#8220;discovery&#8221; because for-whatever-reason the implications are not fully, if at all, appreciated at the time of discovery.  For example, I believe this was the case with penicillin.  A French medical student discovered it 1896, Fleming re-discovered it in 1928 and then it lay around until 1939 when Florey fully appreciated it.</p>
<p>I certainly didn&#8217;t put two and two together when I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Sick-Darwinian/dp/0679746749"><em>Why We Get Sick</em></a> back in 2000-ish.  I thought it a fantastic book (and still do)&#8211; but I didn&#8217;t think of applying the evolutionary lens to diet/nutrition, even though in retrospect, it seems obvious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A successor to <em>Medical Hypotheses</em>, called <em>Hypotheses in the Life Sciences</em>, will be edited by William Bains and published by Buckingham University Press (BUP).</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>Does BUP hope to eventually make money  from the successor journal? Or do they merely hope the subsidy  required will decrease with time?</p>
<p><strong>WILLIAM BAINS </strong>BUP is a small operation, and does not have  the resources to subsidize <em>Hypotheses in the Life Sciences </em>beyond its  start-up stage, so we hope to make enough money to break even fairly soon.  Ultimately the aim is to be profitable. I for one am determined to put  scientific quality first, and I have emphasized to BUP that I only want the  journal to grow (and hence generate more revenue) when the quality of  submissions allows it.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> What led BUP to decide to publish the new journal?</p>
<p><strong>BAINS</strong> I think a combination of similarity in philosophy and being in the right place  at the right time. They thought it was an exciting project which would both  raise their profile (in a good way) and make them money. Buckingham University  is the UK&#8217;s only private university, and as such takes a heterodox, even  iconoclastic view towards what the academic establishment says is writ in stone.  The Chancellor has a robust approach to academic and individual freedom.Â So  a journal trying to do something rather new, enabling those with good ideas but  little power to be heard, fitted with their approach. Â For me, an added  advantage is that I deal directly with the man at the top. There are no  intermediate layers of management to take decisions about the journal, and  weÂ discuss everything from philosophy to web page design. This is the sort  of immediacy you do not get with a big publisher.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A successor to <em>Medical Hypotheses</em>, titled <em>Hypotheses in the Life Sciences</em>, will soon be published. I asked Bruce Charlton and William Bains, the founder of the new journal, about the economics of the situation.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS</strong> Did <em>Medical Hypotheses</em> make money for Elsevier? How much did it cost to  run per year (leaving aside time contributed by you and the editorial  board)? How much of that did Elsevier pay?</p>
<p><strong>BRUCE CHARLTON</strong>Â  <em>Medical Hypotheses</em> did <strong>for sure</strong> make money for Elsevier &#8211; but I was never allowed to see the accounts.<span id="more-1951"></span></p>
<p>I was told circa April 2009 that that the journal still made a profit even  after page charges were abolished in early 2009 (income from things like  subscriptions, sales of reprints including paid downloads, but mainly  from its share of internet access &#8216;bundles&#8217; via ScienceDirect &#8211; which is  purchased mainly via library subscriptions from colleges etc).</p>
<p>Costs were my salary plus a share of the Elsevier editorial team &#8211; the  journal secretary, the person who put together the issues and the  manager &#8211; i.e., three main people at Elsevier each of whom worked on a  group of journals.</p>
<p>Before 2009, when <em>Medical Hypotheses</em> still had page charges, the  journal will have been <strong>very</strong> profitable since it had the above sources  of income <strong>plus</strong> about page charges at about 60 dollars per thousand  words, for a journal of between 160-240 pages, with about 500 words per  page &#8211; that&#8217;s roughly 50 thousand dollars extra income per issue &#8211; with  12 issues per year that is roughly half a million dollars p.a. in page  charges alone. Over seven years as editor I must have generated a few million dollars income for Elsevier.</p>
<p>So &#8211; in my opinion Elsevier&#8217;s behavior with <em>Medical Hypotheses</em> does not  make <strong>business</strong> sense, since it lost them a lot of income and risked  even more. Also hounding a successful editor, and sacking him before the  contract was finished and with issues for 2010 un-compiled (and with  nobody lined up to replace me) did not make business sense, nor did the  mass of bad publicity all this generated for Elsevier.</p>
<p>My inference is that an individual or group in Elsevier senior management &#8211; perhaps Senior Vice President (USA) Glen P Campbell, who began the whole business and who has remained personally active in  it (including the appointment of the new editor) &#8211; I guess that Campbell  took a personal interest in Medical Hypotheses and in my editorship for  reasons unknown to me &#8211; and drove the whole process.</p>
<p>The most sinister aspect of the whole thing for me is that senior  Elsevier managers are now exerting personal influence on the content of  the scientific literature and the conduct of science (overseeing  appointment of editors, new restrictions on editorial conduct etc) &#8211; and  they are doing this not for business reasons, but presumably to pursue  their own private agendas.</p>
<p>The strict legalistic definition of academic freedom<br />
(for what it is worth &#8212; see <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r3nLzFaK454C&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=Louis+Menand+academic+freedom&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=G690Y50Or6&#038;sig=ObScrfPCx7gAevelNG-jceG_k5M&#038;hl=en&#038;ei=NiNJTPKxHaH20gS07fCECw&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=2&#038;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false)">writings by Louis Menand</a>)<br />
is that academics be autonomous in the conduct of academic work  (conduct, appointments, promotions, reviewing etc). The <em>Medical  Hypotheses</em> Affair shows Elsevier very clearly in breach of academic  freedom, and every competent editor will immediately recognize this  fact.</p>
<p>In addition, in the later stages of the journal, Elsevier managers were  also involved in covertly selecting (i.e. rejecting) what they  considered &#8216;controversial&#8217; <em>Medical Hypotheses</em> papers &#8211; the papers were  intercepted after I had formally accepted them and held back, some were  later rejected.</p>
<p>Elsevier also employed the Lancet (which they own) to choose &#8216;peer  reviewers&#8217; for the Duesberg and Ruggiero papers and arrange to have them  rejected (using criteria quite different from those of <em>Medical  Hypotheses</em>).</p>
<p>So that we know for sure that the Elsevier owned <em>Lancet </em>(one of the most  prestigious medical journals in the world &#8211; perhaps the most  prestigious?) is nowadays in the pocket of Elsevier management, and  willing to do dirty jobs for them.</p>
<p>Yet there has been no outcry against Elsevier&#8217;s breach of academic  autonomy from senior journal editors (nothing from the editors of  Nature, Science, Lancet (understandably, since they are Elsevier  employees), NEJM, JAMA, BMJ etc.). This silence means, I take it, that  these senior editors are <strong>not </strong>any longer autonomous journals, but are  nowadays in the pocket of their own publishers and live in fear of their  own jobs.</p>
<p>The <em>Medical Hypotheses</em> affair is therefore a straw in the wind: an  indicator on a small scale of what is happening at the larger scale:  i.e. the thoroughly dishonest and hypocritical state of modern science  and academia, and the domination of the content and conduct of science  by outside interests.</p>
<p>But the unusual point that is not well understood is that key aspects of  these outside interests are not always operating in profit maximizing  ways. My understanding is that senior managers (in the private and  public sector) are &#8216;using&#8217; &#8211; even exploiting &#8211; their organization&#8217;s  resources in pursuing personal goals &#8211; engaging in a kind of moral  grandstanding, in making large gestures which show how &#8216;ethical&#8217; they  are in their views &#8211; at everyone else&#8217;s expense.</p>
<p>This can be most clearly seen in the &#8216;Green&#8217; &#8216;ethical&#8217; behaviours linked  to the Global Warming scam &#8211; senior managers have shown themselves  willing to sacrifice efficiency in pursuit of large moralistic policy  gestures of &#8216;caring about the planet&#8217; with which they become personally  associated (recycling schemes, fair trade, campaigns of &#8216;save energy&#8217; or  promote public transportation among staff etc &#8211; none of which are  actually effective in terms of real world effects, but which are  effective in expressing &#8216;concern&#8217;).</p>
<p>Such moral gestures are invariably designed to appeal to elite PC  opinion &#8211; it is a major form of status competition among the elites. My guess is that something of this sort is behind what happened at  <em>Medical Hypotheses</em>: a senior manager or group of managers at Elsevier  probably wanted to show themselves and their peers that they were taking  a strong &#8216;moral&#8217; stance against people who published AIDS-denialist  papers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A writer for UC Berkeley media relations wanted to interview me for <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2010/07/15_happiness.shtml">this press release</a> about the Tsinghua Psychology department. I said I&#8217;d blogged a lot about Tsinghua but she said she wanted &#8220;fresh quotes&#8221;. So I wrote this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Why did you decide to take this opportunity [become a professor at Tsinghua]?</em></p>
<p>Partly because I  wanted to write more books &#8212; in addition to <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em> &#8212; and  this job would let me, because I only teach one semester per year.  Partly because I thought the undergraduates would be brilliant. Partly  because I thought living in Beijing would be fascinating.</p>
<p><em>What have you learned/discovered?</em></p>
<p>How talented the students  are. To get into Tsinghua as an undergraduate, you have to score  extremely well on a nationwide test. Oh, so they&#8217;re bookish? Not quite. A  month ago I went to a talent show put on by biomedical-engineering  majors. One act was five girls dancing. After a few minutes someone told  me that three of the girls were boys. I hadn&#8217;t noticed. It was really  hard to tell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Influenced by <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/17/learning-from-mulan/">Mulan</a>, perhaps.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alexandra Carmichael is one of the founders of <a href="http://www.curetogether.com/">CureTogether.com</a>, whom I met at a Quantified Self meeting last year. A few days ago, she left <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2010/02/06/experiments-in-gift-giving/#comment-390054">an interesting comment</a> on one of my posts:</p>
<blockquote><p>I practice random acts of kindness, with a goal of helping at least 10 people a day (and at least 1 person I donâ€™t know). I find this helps my mood toward the end of the day, when it is most likely to fall &#8211; no matter what else has happened that day, at least Iâ€™ve helped 10 people.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked her about it:</p>
<p>SETH Where did the idea come from?</p>
<p>ALEXANDRA It goes all the way back to my grandparents being Scout leaders &#8211; I was never in the Scouts myself but I observed how helpful and supportive they always were. Then during my university years when I was forming my life philosophy, I got to attend an incredible lecture by Jane Goodall. Her organization Roots &#038; Shoots inspires people around the world to give back to the earth, animals, and people around them, with her amazing presence and the quote &#8220;Every individual can make a difference.&#8221; Service learning is also one of the things we thread into homeschooling our two daughters, along with design, simple living, and non-violent communication.</p>
<p>The specific goal of helping 10 people a day started last summer during a goal-setting weekend. I was curious to see if formalizing and quantifying something I had been doing in a fuzzier way would make a difference in my life, if measuring acts of kindness would result in an increased number of acts, or more friends, or help me with my chronic depression &#8211; plus I love quantifying things! <img src='http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  I don&#8217;t find it necessary to actually record how many people I help in a day, but I keep a rough running tally in my head as I go through the day to make sure it&#8217;s at least 10 &#8211; my kids like to help with this count too.</p>
<p>SETH What are some examples of these acts?</p>
<p>ALEXANDRA I do a lot of different things. If I get extra free tickets to events or conferences, I will pass them along to people who I think would love to go; I will offer to take a picture of a tourist family where one person inevitably gets left out behind the camera; I will connect people who I think would benefit from knowing each other; I will take two hours to listen and hug and support a child who is having a hard time learning a new skill; I will answer a newbie entrepreneur&#8217;s questions about how to get started in business or help them spread their message; I will help coordinate gatherings that I believe in (such as Quantified Self); I will hold the door for someone. It can be anything really, no matter how small.</p>
<p>SETH How have people reacted when you tell them about this?</p>
<p>ALEXANDRA The most frequent reaction is &#8220;That sounds too challenging to do every day &#8211; 10 people? Why not 1 or 2?&#8221; The second most frequent reaction is &#8220;You are inspiring me to make positive changes in my own life.&#8221; My answer to both is &#8220;I love helping people!&#8221;</p>
<p>SETH What have you learned?</p>
<p>ALEXANDRA if you help people, without wanting anything in return, you get help when you need it &#8211; often surprising help, and often more than you gave. I learned that helping people seems to make them like you more, so my number of online friends has skyrocketed (1500 on Twitter, 800 on Facebook, 500 on LinkedIn) &#8211; but close &#8220;in person&#8221; friends I choose to limit to a handful because of my tendency to get overwhelmed by frequent or shallow social situations. I learned that helping people does help with depression, because (a) you have something else to focus on outside of yourself and (b) you go through the day with an expectant air of wonder at who will be the next person you can help. I also learned that helping 10 people a day is really not a lot, and I often wind up helping 20 or more people in a day. Of course, this is only from my perspective &#8211; I can&#8217;t guarantee that all of these people actually feel helped, I just know that I tried to help.</p>
<p>SETH When you say &#8220;if you help people, without wanting anything in return, you get help when you need it &#8211; often surprising help, and often more than you gave&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure I understand. Can you give some examples?</p>
<p>ALEXANDRA It&#8217;s not so much that the people I help help me in return, but more that by spreading goodwill and being tuned in to what others need, I also became more aware of my own needs and started to feel a greater sense of self-worth, like I deserved to have my needs met. This is not something I was taught growing up, and I went through two bouts of major postpartum depression without asking for or getting the support I needed. I feel much more open about my needs now, which perhaps makes it easier for others to help me. So the change was more in me than in others.</p>
<p>In terms of specific examples, when I learned that I have a Tourette&#8217;s spectrum disorder, and tweeted that, I made an incredible new friend who has been through similar neurological issues, and who in our conversations of support and empathy has helped me more than I can ever thank him for. Also, when I decided to find some consulting work to support my family while we build CureTogether, a very welcoming door opened (soon to be made public), and offered me basically a dream position. I guess I needed to learn to ask for and accept help as well as to give it.</p>
<p>SETH Thanks, Alexandra. It&#8217;s especially interesting that helping others raised your feeling of self-worth. I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed it would have that effect.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wehrintheworld.blogspot.com/">Justin Wehr</a> asked me some interview questions and decided not to publish my answers. I thought they were good questions. Here they are, reworded slightly, and my answers.</p>
<p>QUESTION Of the experimental treatments you have studied, which ones have the most positive effect on your life?</p>
<p>ANSWER From more to less effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effect of morning faces on mood</li>
<li>Effect of fermented food on health</li>
<li>(tie) Effect of animal fat on health</li>
<li>(tie) Effect of omega-3 on health</li>
<li>Weight-control experiments.</li>
</ul>
<p>QUESTION What about everyone else?</p>
<p>ANSWERÂ  It depends on how far in the future you look. The morning faces stuff is the most important, I&#8217;m sure, but it&#8217;s also the hardest to implement. The fermented food stuff is easy to implement. It&#8217;s easy to eat more yogurt. So I believe that in the short term, the fermented foods stuff will have the most effect on others, in the long term, the faces stuff.</p>
<p>QUESTION Much of your research is related to the idea that we get sick because we live differently now than long ago. Can you explain this? Are there exceptions?</p>
<p>ANSWER Our genes were shaped to work well in one environment. Now our environment is quite different. All sorts of things go wrong &#8212; we don&#8217;t eat an optimal diet, for example &#8212; and our bodies malfunction in all sorts of ways. The exception is that once we know what an optimal diet (or environment) is we can assure it. For example, we can make sure we get the optimal amount of Vitamin C. The health problems caused by progress can be fixed, in other words, and we can emerge in better shape than ever before.</p>
<p>QUESTION How much time a day do you spend on self-experimentation?</p>
<p>ANSWER About ten minutes. Measuring various things, such as blood pressure and brain function.</p>
<p>QUESTION Why do few people self-experiment?</p>
<p>ANSWER Millions of people self-experiment. For example, millions of fat people try many different ways to lose weight. Professional scientists (e.g., med-school professors) do not self-experiment, at least publicly, because it is low-status, because it is frowned upon (by their colleagues), because it might be hard to publish the results, and because it won&#8217;t help them get grants.</p>
<p>QUESTION How do you determine an appropriate dosage for treatments that might have a good effect on what you measure but a bad effect on other things? For example, maybe animal fat is good for sleep but bad for other things.</p>
<p>ANSWER I don&#8217;t worry about it. Just as all electric appliances are designed to use the same house current, I&#8217;m sure all parts of our body are designed to work best with the same diet.</p>
<p>QUESTION Could advances in medical technologies (such as regenerative medicine) replace the need to live healthily? For example, if we could easily replace livers, maybe people could drink more.</p>
<p>ANSWER Not likely. Except that the more we know about nutrition the more we can replace our ancestors&#8217; diet with a diet made up of the necessary nutrients. For example, I drink flaxseed oil to get omega-3. I&#8217;m sure our long-ago ancestors got omega-3 in other ways. So I no longer need to be like them. Basic nutrition isn&#8217;t medical technology, but it is a way in which it is easier to be healthy.</p>
<p>QUESTION What don&#8217;t you know, but wish you did?</p>
<p>ANSWER How to make book-writing as addictive as Wii Tennis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tyler Cowen&#8217;s new book <em>Create Your Own Economy: The Path to Prosperity in a Disordered World</em> has a lot to say about two topics in which I am especially interested: autism and human diversity. What can the rest of us learn from people with autism? What does the wide range of outcomes among autistic adults tell us about our world? I interviewed Tyler by email about his book.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>If I remember correctly, you think a book should be new, true, and something else. What&#8217;s the something else?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>The &#8220;something else&#8221; should cover at least two qualities.</p>
<p>First, if everyone read the book and was persuaded by it, would anything change for the better?  An author should aim to write a book which matters.</p>
<p>Second, the book should reflect something the author really cares about.  If the author doesn&#8217;t care, why should the reader?</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>What was the tipping point for this  book &#8212; the event that made you say: I&#8217;m going to write a book about THIS?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>To me it&#8217;s very important what an author is thinking about in his or her spare time, if the phrase &#8220;spare time&#8221; even applies to my life, which has an extreme blending of work and leisure time.  Ideally that is what an author should be writing about.  At some point you realize: &#8220;Hey, I am constantly thinking about xxxxx in my spare time!&#8221; And then you want to write it up.</p>
<p>I also hit up the idea of this book through pondering the lives of some particular individuals I know &#8212; and how much they *live* the thesis of my book &#8212; although I am not sure they would wish to be identified publicly.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>Have you been to Autreat, the annual conference of Autism Network International, that you mention? If so, did it affect your thinking?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>I haven&#8217;t been to Autreat, which for me is located somewhat inconveniently away from major cities (that is on purpose, I believe). I&#8217;m also not clear on exactly who is welcome, who needs an invitation, etc.  Most conferences have a very high variance in quality across presentations and mostly one goes to meet one or two key people; often you don&#8217;t know in advance who they will be.  I suspect the same logic applies to Autreat as well.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>Do you think there are jobs that persons with autism do better than persons without autism?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>Autistics often exhibit superior skills in attention to detail, pattern recognition, what I call &#8220;mental ordering,&#8221; and they have areas of strong preferred interests, in which they are very often superb self-educators.  So yes, that will make many autistics very good at some jobs but also poorly suited for others.  But I don&#8217;t want to generalize and say &#8220;autistics are better at job X,&#8221; that would be misleading. Across autistics there is a wide variety of cognitive skills and also problems. Engineering and computer science are the stereotypical areas where you expect to find higher than average rates of autism. While I suspect this is true in terms of the average, it can be misleading to focus on the stereotype precisely because of the high variance of skills and outcomes among autistics.  One of the central issues in understanding autism is grasping the connection between the underlying unity of the phenomenon and the extreme variability of the results.  In the short run, positive stereotypes can perform a useful educating function.  But the more we present stereotypes, the more we are getting people away from coming to terms with that more fundamental issue, namely an understanding of the variance.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>There is a basic biological phenomenon in which animals and plants under stress become more variable. Some say variability in the genotype has been released into the phenotype. Do you think the variance seen in autism has been &#8220;released&#8221; in some way?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>I am not sure I understand the question&#8230;for one thing I am not sure what is the postulated increase in genetic stress&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>Yes, it&#8217;s a confusing question. Let&#8217;s try this: What do you think the high variance of outcome seen in autism is telling us?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>I&#8217;ll try to make that more concrete.  One view of autism is that autistics have greater access to lower-level perception and such that access is essential for understanding autism.  On one hand it gives autistics some special abilities, such as pattern recognition, certain kinds of information processing, and noticing small changes with great skill.  (In some cases this also leads to savant-like abilities.) This also may be connected to some of the problems which autistics experience, such as hyper-sensitivities to some kinds of public environments.</p>
<p>It could be that non-autistics have a faculty, or faculties, which &#8220;cut off&#8221; or automatically organize a lot of this lower level perception.  The implication would be that for autistics this faculty is somehow weaker, missing, or &#8220;broken.&#8221;  The underlying unity in autism would be that this faculty is somehow different, relative to non-autistics.  The resulting variance is that the difference in this faculty gives rise to abilities and disabilities which very much differ across autistics.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one attempt to come to terms with both the unity of autism and the variance within it.  It&#8217;s a tough question and we don&#8217;t know the right answer yet, in my view.  What I outlined is just one hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>A clear parallel in the increased variance of autistic persons is the increased variance of left-handers. Left-handers have brain organizations that vary much more than the brain organization of right-handers. Right-handers are all one way; left-handers are all over the place. Do you see any similarities between left-handers and persons with autism?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>I recall some claims that autistics are more likely to be left-handed but I&#8217;ve never looked into their veracity.  There are so many false claims about autism that one must be very careful.</p>
<p>ADHD is another example of something which produces high variance outcomes.  I don&#8217;t think it is correct to call it a disorder *per se*.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just starting to wrap our heads around the &#8220;high variance&#8221; idea. Most people have the natural instinct to attach gross labels of good or bad even when a subtler approach is called for.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>The term<em> left-hander</em> is confusing because left-handers aren&#8217;t the opposite of right-handers. The dichotomy is okay but the two sides are better labeled right-handers and non-right-handers. In other words, one group (right-handers) has something (a certain brain organization); the other group doesn&#8217;t have that brain organization. Then the vast difference in variance makes sense. How accurate would it be to say that non-autistics have something than autistics don&#8217;t have? (I&#8217;m left-handed, by the way.)</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>I would say we still don&#8217;t have a fully coherent definition of autism.  And &#8220;have&#8221; is a tricky word.  I think of autistic brains as different, rather than &#8220;normal&#8221; brains with &#8220;missing parts.&#8221;  Some researchers postulate differences in the kind of connections autistic brains make.  In thirty years I expect we will know much, much more than we do right now.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>I hope this isn&#8217;t too self-indulgent: What do you make of the correlation between autism and digestive problems?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>I don&#8217;t think there are convincing theories about either digestive problems causing autism or autism causing digestive problems.  There is *maybe* a correlation through a common genetic cause, but even if that is true it is not very useful as a means of understanding autism.  This is another area where there are many strong opinions, often stronger than are justified by the facts.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>Another &#8220;assorted&#8221; question: I loved the study you mentioned where people with perfect pitch were more likely to be eccentric than those without perfect pitch. That&#8217;s quite a result. How did you learn about it?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>There is a somewhat scattered literature on music, cognition, and society.  It still awaits synthesis, it seems.  Someone could write a very good popular book on the topic.  (Maybe Gabriel Rossman is the guy to do it.)  The more I browsed that literature, the more interesting results I found.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTS </strong>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve done justice to your extremely original book but here is a last question. You talk about Thomas Schelling&#8217;s use of stories. Presumably in contrast to other econ professors. I think of story-telling being something that once upon a time everyone did &#8212; it was the usual way to teach. Why do you think Schelling told stories much more than those around him?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN </strong>Thanks for the kind words.  Schelling has a unique mind, as anyone who has known him will attest.  I don&#8217;t know any other economist or social scientist who thinks like he does, but we&#8217;ve yet to figure out what exactly his unique element consists of.  I would say that Schelling views story-telling as a path to social science wisdom. They&#8217;re not even anecdotes, they&#8217;re stories.  Maybe that doesn&#8217;t sound convincing to an outsider, but it got him a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>I am very interested in the topic of &#8220;styles of thought in economics.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I eat natto (fermented soybeans) once/day. Most of the natto I see in stores is from Japan (soybeans from America) but I found one local source: <a href="http://www.gourmet-natto.com/">Japan Traditional Foods</a>, in Sepastopol, California. Like <a href="http://www.oldwayspt.org/faq.html">many people</a> I believe traditional diets are far healthier than modern ones. How can such diets, now almost extinct in rich countries, become popular again? To learn more about this, I interviewed the owner of Japan Traditional Foods, Minami Satoh.</em></p>
<p><em>How did your company begin?</em></p>
<p>I started it in 2006. We started to produce product in November 2008. So far natto is our only product. I went to business school at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbird_School_of_Global_Management">Thunderbird School of Global Management</a>, a private business school in Arizona, and graduated in 1983. After that, I worked for DuPont in Japan, but I wanted to work in the US. At DuPont, I did marketing of Teflon and Silverstone (a sister brand of Teflon). Then I worked for my father&#8217;s company selling wholesale steel pipe and tubes. I was successful but felt it was boring. I thought food would be more interesting. I acquired a small natto-making company (Yaguchi Foods<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10pt; color: #1f497d">) in Japan in 2004 or 2005. The owner had died. His relatives sold it to me.</span></p>
<p>In 2004, I came to America to meet Malcolm Clark. He&#8217;s the great-grandson of Dr. Clark, who is very famous in Japan. Malcolm Clark was responsible for introducing shitake mushrooms to America. He owns Gourmet Mushrooms in Sebastopol and lives in Occidental. Natto is an unusual food, like shitake mushrooms. I thought he could give me good advice about how to start making natto or other possibilities. That&#8217;s why the company is in Sebastopol. When I met Clark, he was thinking of retiring. I bought a stake in Gourmet Mushrooms; now Gourmet Mushrooms helps Japan Traditional Foods sell natto. I moved here in June 2008 to manage this company.</p>
<p><em>Why natto?</em></p>
<p>Americans already eat tofu, soy sauce, miso, edaname, and soy milk &#8212; but no natto. Natto is more nutritious than the other forms of soy that we currently eat. It&#8217;s more nutritious because of fermentation. It has more vitamins. A enzyme found in natto called nattokinase dissolves blood clots. In Japan natto is a traditional health food. It is usually eaten at breakfast.</p>
<p><em>How is natto made?</em></p>
<p>You boil the soybeans in a steam basket. Spray with bascillus. Put the soybeans in a paper cup. Put the cups in a fermentation container for 20-24 hours. Take them out and put in packages. Then give to the distributor. If you ferment more than 20 hours, natto bascillus start to eat themselves, which produces ammonia. Most companies stop fermenting at that point to avoid ammonia. If fermented longer, it may smell of ammonia. Japanese accept this, but Americans may not.</p>
<p><em>How big is Japan Traditional Foods?</em></p>
<p>One person plus myself. I hired someone from my natto company in Japan. He makes artisanal natto. He handcrafts it.. We put it in the paper cups by hand.</p>
<p><em>How did you get distribution?</em></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t hard. There are two distributors, one for Los Angeles, the other for San Francisco. They specialize in Japanese markets. Now it&#8217;s in close to 30 stores, including Korean and Chinese stores. The Los Angeles distributor wanted to sell his stuff in New York but the shipping costs would have been too high. This summer we will start going to farmer&#8217;s markets. We&#8217;ll have aÂ  booth there to sell and sample. The goal is to educate and share recipes. We&#8217;ll be at the San Rafael Sunday market and the Ferry Building Tuesday lunchtime market. It&#8217;s a kind of test. We&#8217;re talking to distributors about getting the product into non-Japanese grocery stores, such asÂ  Berkeley Bowl and Whole Foods. From the farmer&#8217;s markets we hope to get feedback to improve the packaging, size, and recipes. We want to find the best ways to make the Western market receptive to natto. For example, we can sample it in different ways. In Japan, the most popular way to eat it is over rice with finely chopped green onions, often at breakfast. I&#8217;ve come up with many different recipes: with rice or bagel or lettuce or crackers. With different sauces and toppings.</p>
<p><em>What were the hard parts?</em></p>
<p>It was difficult to find a good temperature control system here; I had to import it from Japan. I also needed a big steam cooker, which I had to import. This was hard because it is prohibited to export them from Japan to other countries.</p>
<p><em>Your promotional leaflet says &#8220;stir natto more than twenty times&#8221; before eating it. Why?</em></p>
<p>We do not have any valid research on this. But somebody says stirring natto creates the &#8220;Fifth Taste&#8221; we call &#8220;umami.&#8221; Somebody else said that it gets the natto bacillus awake again with oxygen because the bacillus was sleeping in the refrigerator.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I sampled four brands of kombucha available in Berkeley; my favorite was from <a href="http://www.rejuvenationcompany.com/Home_Page.html">Rejuvenation Company</a>. They are in Emeryville, which is close to where I live. &#8220;Can I visit your manufacturing facility?&#8221; I asked. The answer was no, but they were happy to be interviewed. So I interviewed Chris Campagna and Jerry Campagna, who are the company&#8217;s two employees. Before the interview I discovered they also made the rejuvelac I&#8217;d bought after a reader of this blog <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/01/26/the-inuit-paradox/#comment-265832">recommended it</a> (&#8220;When I was a database administrator at Whole Foods, I used to drink it daily and never felt better&#8221;). Those are their two products: kombucha and rejuvelac.</em></p>
<p><strong>How did your company begin?</strong></p>
<p>It was started in 1983 in San Francisco by Dennis Campagna [Jerry's brother, Chris's uncle]. He was a health-food fanatic, a die-hard vegetarian, and a hippie. Now retired. He is ten years older than Jerry, but , Jerry says, looks younger.] At the beginning, he sold several health-food juices, such as carrot juice and wheat grass juice, but he also sold Rejuvelac. That was the part of the product line that&#8217;s lasted. He made them in a shared kitchen. Back then, there were dozens of small health food stores in San Francisco. It was a one-man show. Dennis drove around to them.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvelac">rejuvelac</a>?</strong></p>
<p>A fermented grain drink. We use wheat. You sprout wheat berries with water,Â  ferment them for a while, then strain out the wheat berries. We&#8217;re the only company we know of that sells it.</p>
<p><strong>Why do your products say &#8220;Keep Refrigerated&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>The Health Department wanted it. For years and years, they sat store shelves, not refrigerated.</p>
<p><strong>When did you start making kombucha? </strong></p>
<p>Five years ago. Dennis added it to his product line. It took a few years to catch on. He&#8217;d been making it for himself for years &#8212; making it, drinking it, giving it to friends. We&#8217;re tiny players in the kombucha market. <a href="http://www.gtskombucha.com/kombucha.html">Synergy</a> is the big player. Maybe there are 10-15 manufacturers around the country, it&#8217;s hard to know the exact number. There&#8217;s no Kombucha Manufacturers Association.Â  Some commercial kombuchas are pasteurized; look on their websites to find out which ones. [<a href="http://www.wonderdrink.com/kwd_faq/faqs.asp">Kombucha Wonder Drink</a> is pasteurized.] Our kombucha isn&#8217;t pasteurized.</p>
<p><strong>How has the business changed? </strong></p>
<p>It used to be lots of mom-and-pop stores. The people who owned the store ran it. They recommended stuff to their customers. The customer would come in with a health problem, the owner would say, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try this?&#8221; Now Whole Food dominates. The emphasis has changed. The buyers want to know: Will it sell? As opposed to true quality. Nowadays, the main way we spread is that someone buys our products on a trip to San Francisco and goes home and sends us email: Where can we get it? We say: If you really want it, go to your store manager and tell him. You have a tremendous amount of clout. They listen to you. It often works out that we get a store out of that deal. We don&#8217;t do internet sales.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, our sales have grown a lot. Five years ago, we were mostly in San Francisco, mostly in small stores. Around 20-30 small stores. Now we&#8217;re in roughly 100-120 stores. It&#8217;s hard to have a store locator on our website because distributors don&#8217;t want to tell us who they deal with. [Their <a href="http://www.rejuvenationcompany.com/Store_Locator.html">store locator page</a>.] In the Bay Area, we&#8217;re sold at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, Rainbow Grocery, plus smaller stores. In Santa Cruz, at Staff of Life. We&#8217;re moving into Whole Foods in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Portland. Pretty soon you should be able to get it in any Whole Foods on the West Coast.</p>
<p><strong>What do your customers say?</strong></p>
<p>A year ago, we got a phone call from a woman in San Francisco. I&#8217;m moving to Utah, where can I buy your product? Eight years earlier, she&#8217;d been sick. [Digestive problems, apparently.] Her doctor had given her antibiotics. She didn&#8217;t get better. She was given more antibiotics. Still didn&#8217;t get better. This went on for several months. She couldn&#8217;t eat anything. Even baby food would make her gaseous. She was turning ashen, suffering from malnutrition. Then she got a small bottle of rejuvelac. Just 30 minutes after drinking it, she felt a little better. She&#8217;d been drinking it regularly for eight years, didn&#8217;t want to be without it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ROBERTSÂ  How is it possible that Cal Techâ€™s basketball team was considered better than UCLAâ€™s basketball team in the 1950s? That was the part I was amazed at.</p>
<p>MLODINOW At least the early part of the decade.Â  That was harder to understand than the Girl Named Florida Problem. I think in those days basketball was nothing&#8211;imagine saying that the Cal Tech curling team is better than the UCLA curling team. Since nobody really cares about curling itâ€™s just a quaint fact that someone at Cal Tech, probably in the faculty, would care about curling well enough to organize a team. Maybe Iâ€™m exaggerating a little bit, but in the 50s I think it was a much different sport and a much different sports world. Not to belittle their team; I think they had some really good players from the looks of it and maybe Cal Tech cared more about recruiting players for sports than they do today. Maybe our world in general is a little looser about things and you could invest the time to play sports more even if you were at a high-powered place like Cal Tech; not to be as pressured&#8211;to just study. I guess it was just a different world in some ways&#8211;a nice world&#8211;back then that could happen. Now college basketball is just a huge and money generating industry that no one would allow a school like Cal Tech&#8211;by allow it I donâ€™t mean that thereâ€™s some individual disallowing it but the world will not allow, itâ€™s not loose enough to allow, a school thatâ€™s not completely focused on that sport to have a good team in that sport. Everything is too high-powered today.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes. Of all the things in your book, that was the most staggering.</p>
<p>MLODINOW You should see the movie Quantum Hoops; itâ€™s a documentary about the Cal Tech basketball team. I recommend it.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I didnâ€™t know there was such a movie.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Itâ€™s on DVD; Iâ€™m thinking it must be available from NetFlix.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, Iâ€™ll get it.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Itâ€™s very amusing&#8211;it is for me because of my connection to Cal Tech&#8211;but I think for the general public, itâ€™s a very amusing film.</p>
<p>ROBERTS We were talking about unexpected things. If you looked at the Cal Tech basketball team, if you just looked at basketball in the 1950s, you would think, â€˜Well, Cal Tech&#8211;thatâ€™s as it should be.â€™ But then all of the sudden, 20 years later, itâ€™s so very different.</p>
<p>MLODINOW I think in those days it was more like a club, like a sport, like what you think of as a kidsâ€™ fun activity and now the athletes for basketball are heavily recruited and bribed in one way or another, and the huge amounts of money at stake for the school for them. Itâ€™s a totally different calculus and itâ€™s sad in a way, isnâ€™t it? I think everything is like that today.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I guess what Iâ€™m saying is that there was something&#8211;youâ€™re in the 1950s, itâ€™s 1956&#8211;very few people saw that there was something hidden in basketball that could lead to what it became.</p>
<p>MLODINOW And if you were the superstar of that time you also didnâ€™t get the rewards of what became today and itâ€™s a little bit late for you now, right? I know in the bathroom in the Cal Tech cafeteria there was a framed article about him, I canâ€™t remember his name, one of the superstars of the 50s who was one of the best basketball players to ever live&#8211;I think they claim that even today&#8211;who basically probably never even made a living from it, or not a good living.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, that kind of brings us back to the very beginning. I feel like somehow the times have changed and people are smarter. Now you can make a living from what youâ€™re doing. Youâ€™re writing this very entertaining intellectual history; finally thereâ€™s a market for it. Finally people are smart enough to be at your level so that you can write a book that you respect but you can get a wide enough audience.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Are you saying that in the 50s that couldnâ€™t have been done? I donâ€™t know.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Well, nobody did it; letâ€™s put it that way.</p>
<p>MLODINOW No, nobody did it. I donâ€™t know why.</p>
<p>ROBERTS As I said before we started recording, youâ€™re the first person to ever do this. Will you be the last? I donâ€™t know but youâ€™re the first. Youâ€™re the first person to write intellectual histories that actually are popular and that people want to read, that theyâ€™re not forced to read by their teachers. Itâ€™s not just a tiny group of people reading them. Professors of course write them but theyâ€™re not well written and itâ€™s just their job to write them; they get a salary from the government to write those books. Youâ€™re not getting any salary. Youâ€™re an entrepreneur and itâ€™s just so different. Your books have to be popular or your job goes away. Itâ€™s just a different level of competence; your books are just infinitely more accessible, infinitely better than a professor would normally write. A professor is subsidized and thatâ€™s what is basically comes down to. Practically everybody who writes about science is subsidized but youâ€™re not.</p>
<p>When the TV show The Simpson came along I would talk about IQ scores in my class and I talk about the fact that they had been rising and so forth. And I say, â€˜Well you know there is evidence that people are getting smarter and one example is The Simpsons; this is at a higher level than other TV shows that came before it.â€™ Now maybe thatâ€™s not so important, how intelligent is an animated show, but I think what youâ€™re doing is very important and I think it may be a sign of increased intelligence. Thereâ€™s enough of a market now for what youâ€™re doing. There wasnâ€™t before.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Iâ€™m certainly glad that there is and that people appreciate the way I put things.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Iâ€™m glad because that means you can do so much more of it.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes, and I look forward to that. Itâ€™s a great privilege to be able to do that.</p>
<p>ROBERTS When I was a freshman at Cal Tech I was always looking for books like yours but they just didnâ€™t exist. So I ended up reading The New Yorker for my intellectual history. That was very narrow; they never did a good job of covering science. They never talked about geometry or DeMoivre, Laplace, or Gauss. They didnâ€™t cover those people. But those people are important. But you do; finally we have someone. Itâ€™s great.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MLODINOW As I start talking about events in the world around us and looking at the psychological components&#8211;and I dealt with that, I greatly expanded that part&#8211;they were fascinating studies and I was just so interested I just kept putting more and more into the book.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, thatâ€™s when you decided to ask me for help. &#8220;Oh, I wasnâ€™t planning on this.&#8221; How did you learn about the lottery winner who won twice&#8211;the Canadian?</p>
<p>MLODINOW It was in a book somewhere, an academic book. A lot of those interesting stories came from academic papers or books.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Thatâ€™s interesting.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Sometimes Iâ€™ll find something in the newspaper that was really interesting and I would track it down but a lot of it was in academic research. I donâ€™t know why they found it.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, who knows where they got it, but thatâ€™s where you got it. How did you learn about the Girl Named Florida stuff? Some professor told you?</p>
<p>MLODINOW My friend Mark Hillery that I mentioned from Berkeley.</p>
<p>ROBERTS A physics professor.</p>
<p>MLODINOW He heard it somewhere&#8230; It wasnâ€™t quite this problem but then I kind of tweaked it and made it the Girl Named Florida Problem. Thatâ€™s a great problem for the book.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, I loved that. So he got it from some physicist . . .</p>
<p>MLODINOW Iâ€™m not sure; probably. I took a few days to figure out how to make it into this problem; I donâ€™t remember exactly the problem he told me but I tweaked it into this problem. Just to show you how much work goes into the book, I even spent a whole afternoon deciding on the name Florida. I went back into the records&#8211;I needed a rare name&#8211;and I looked up different names and tried to find one that would be colorful, interesting, but that was rarely used, and I wanted to know the percentage that it was used; I dug up percentages of names. Everything in the book . . . if you read it, it might just sound like, â€˜Oh, you knowâ€™ . . .</p>
<p>Not a thing is just tossed out there. Or very little; thereâ€™s an amazing amount of thought and work that goes behind every little detail.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Thatâ€™s a very memorable detail I must say. I like it better than the Monty Hall Problem.</p>
<p>MLODINOW I do, too. I think itâ€™s interesting; I found in the reactions to the book that the Monty Hall Problem has gotten more press and in some ways more reactions, which I found interesting given that it has been talked about before and this problem was completely new. I think this problem is in some ways even more striking than the Monty Hall Problem, more counterintuitive and more difficult to believe and certainly closer to something you might actually encounter. And yet Iâ€™ve gotten a lot more response based on the Monty Hall Problem and a few places have said that I gave the best explanation theyâ€™ve seen. I think the New York Times review said that, too. The New York Times did mention the Girl Named Florida Problem and said that they still find it hard to believe even though they followed the explanation.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I thought your explanation of the Girl Named Florida problem was very clear.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ROBERTS Did the psychology stuff grow and grow? Did you add more and more than you expected?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes. As I was putting a lot of it in the end I would find other studies that really belonged earlier that I would discover, so I would go back and rewrite the earlier parts to incorporate those studies; that became a very fun part of the book, though. That was maybe the most fun, all the psychology studies that I dug out at the end.</p>
<p>ROBERTS How did it happen? You knew that you wanted to include some psychology and then it turned out to be more interesting than you expected?</p>
<p>MLODINOW In the second half of the book when I was talking more and more about viewing life as a random process that weâ€™re going through and applying the concepts of randomness to what weâ€™re seeing in life, I would just naturally come upon these psychology studies.</p>
<p>ROBERTS What fraction of the psychology you read was in the book? I was impressed that you talked about psychology studies that were really good, whereas most of them arenâ€™t. You did a good job of selection and from teaching I know that you have to read a lot of stuff that isnâ€™t good in order to find the good stuff.</p>
<p>MLODINOW What you see in the book is probably a quarter of the stuff that I read or that I thought of putting in the book. In the psychology studies maybe half of them made it into the book and I think I was good at filtering before I even read by following trails of one study leading to other studies and using either textbooks or compilation conference reports to figure out what would be good and what wouldnâ€™t be so good.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m talking about half of the studies where I actually bothered to copy the papers; there are other ones, countless studies, where I would get to the abstract and dismiss it after reading the abstract or one page. That I have no way of counting, thatâ€™s just constant; maybe ten times as many. But the ones that I actually got to where I made copies . . . if I like something I will print it out because I just canâ€™t read dozens of pages on the screen and plus I like to sit in cafÃ©s and carry it around. I guess I could bring my laptop but I tend to print them out. About half of the ones I bothered to print out I put in the book and then there were countless ones that I just dismissed.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, I see what you mean. How did the bookâ€™s structure differ from your original proposal? Did the structure change very much?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes; I donâ€™t remember exactly, but it did. The first chapter was not there in the proposal; the proposal started with chapter two. Then I realized that I needed an introductory chapter to really set the stage for why weâ€™re interested in these things so for introductory chapter, which is applications to life, I start by analyzing certain situations in life that I think are surprising that people misinterpret; I thought that was a good lead-in as to why we care about this. Then I went into other chapters about developing the ideas of randomness and a lot of that was similar to the proposal although I put in less about Brownian motion and the actual drunkardâ€™s walk itself than I think it had in there. The last several chapters, I extended the discussion about life; I think the middle part of the book is fairly similar to the proposal but the beginning and the end I expanded greatly on discussions of the everyday world and applications; the psychology was not in the original proposal nearly at the level that it was in the final book.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, I see what you mean.</p>
<p>MLODINOW . . . again, as I start talking about events in the world around us and looking at the psychological components&#8211;and I dealt with that, I greatly expanded that part&#8211;they were fascinating studies and I was just so interested I just kept putting more and more into the book.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ROBERTS I have some questions about details of the book. What was the hardest part of writing the book? . . . there were no hard parts?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Well, Iâ€™m thinking about it and also thinking about how I interpret the word â€˜hard.â€™ Usually â€˜hardâ€™ would mean that youâ€™re struggling with it and Iâ€™m not sure I exactly struggled with any particular part, in a sense of . . . with all the negative connotations of the word â€˜struggle,â€™ where Iâ€™m unsure of victory and battling and becoming exhausted and fear for my life.</p>
<p>I guess the part that comes to mind that I had the most doubts about whether I could get through it was the structure of the book because it weaves together three areas that are historically not that smoothly tied together&#8211;probability, statistics and the random processes. Or one united subject, like geometry, that you can see the fairly linear development and here it was more intertwined strands. I did have some trouble at first seeing the segue both in concept and tone of the book, from probability to statistics and at the end when Iâ€™m talking more about random processes and very specifically about peoplesâ€™ lives. To make that a smooth transition so it doesnâ€™t seem like two books, a book on the concepts and another book on peoplesâ€™ lives. There was a lot about peoplesâ€™ lives in the earlier parts, too, but in the latter parts of the book, I had less and less actual mathematical concepts and almost solely psychology and sociology and discussion of peoplesâ€™ lives. Figuring out exactly how to do that&#8211;I do remember struggling with that part&#8211;I guess that was the hardest part, I would say.</p>
<p>One other difficult thing was that I went back&#8211;when I was talking about the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Large Numbers&#8211;I went back and looked at the very specific work that was done by DeMoivre, Laplace, Gauss etc.Â  That was difficult because what they actually did is not in the form that is often attributed to them today.Â  I went back and tried to disentangle what they actually showed and tried to figure out what they were thinking, rather than just talking about the modern form of the theorem in textbooks and attributing it to them.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I see.</p>
<p>MLODINOW That took a lot of effort to figure out. I actually went back and found some of the original calculations.</p>
<p>ROBERTS In a library somewhere? In a manuscript?</p>
<p>MLODINOW They&#8217;re in academic books&#8211;there are several academic books, so I found some academic books (academic press books, I mean) that presented their actual calculations. I went through those in order to figure out and explain the differences between what they actually did and what the offshoot of their work looks like today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ROBERTS I think that if you take the different things that happened to you and you measured their effect, the effects will have a power-law distribution. A tiny number will have a huge effect . . .</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes.</p>
<p>ROBERTS . . . and a large number will have very little effect. But I guess you could shift the slope of that power-law distribution if you were smart. My research with rats has involved measuring how long they hold the bar down when they press the bar and it turns out that has a power-law distribution.</p>
<p>MLODINOW That&#8217;s interesting. Why is it that they hold it down with a power-law distribution rather than, letâ€™s say, a normal distribution?</p>
<p>ROBERTS Why? I think itâ€™s because the way the cerebellum is constructed. I think it has to do with . . . the brain is a network and itâ€™s much easier to get a power-law distribution out of a network than out of a non-network and itâ€™s revealing of the mechanism that produces the bar presses. Itâ€™s revealing that it comes from a very networked structure and a little bit more than that, too. Itâ€™s not only networked, itâ€™s also chain reactioning and it sheds some light on the mechanism thatâ€™s producing the bar presses and that mechanism is not so far from what we see in the cerebellum, which has these incredible density of neurons, highly interconnected neurons. So thatâ€™s the connection.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Interesting.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Thatâ€™s the best I can say as to the why. Clearly evolution designed the brain to solve the problems that animals encounter and why does the cerebellum have the structure it does? Because this power-law distribution is a good idea. Normal distribution is probably too conservative, whereas the power-law distribution is . . . every now and then itâ€™s searching much more widely.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Searching for . . . to see if holding it down less or more amount of time will have any effect, so the power-law you will have some of those explorations into holding it down not long or extra long and therefore sometimes discover something new, rather than really more narrow . . . in a narrow band holding it down a certain number of milliseconds or whatever.</p>
<p>ROBERTS I would guess that the brain has been shaped to produce the power-law distribution in those operations and I think thereâ€™s probably other patterns of variability in other aspects of behavior but this is the one we measured.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ROBERTS What did you think of <em>The Black Swan</em> on the same topic?</p>
<p>MLODINOW Itâ€™s on the topic of how little things can cause big changes, you mean, and . . .</p>
<p>ROBERTS And how poorly we understand what really matters.</p>
<p>MLODINOWÂ  I haven&#8217;t read the book from beginning to end so itâ€™s hard to comment on that.</p>
<p>ROBERTS What about his previous book? There are similar ideas in the two books.</p>
<p>MLODINOW I didnâ€™t really notice that book when I started writing <em>Drunkardâ€™s Walk</em>; I wasnâ€™t aware of the book. I had looked&#8211;in the library&#8211;gone through tons of books that seemed somehow related to randomness and somehow that one didnâ€™t stand out to me. Sometime later it came out in paperback and it got very popular. Then I rediscovered it, and yes, I agree with a lot of what he says in that first book, but I still never read it from cover to cover. Iâ€™m not the type who feels compulsive about reading everything thatâ€™s been written on the subject that Iâ€™m writing on.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes. I always think of his book as being about these very long-tailed distributions&#8211;not only about that, but they play a large role&#8211;whereas you didnâ€™t mention long-tailed distributions in your book.</p>
<p>MLODINOW Not explicitly, but I did talk about that idea and certainly the idea that not everything follows a normal distribution and how important it is to note that, for instance in Hollywood&#8211;Hollywood box office receipts. But I think <em>The Black Swan</em> was exclusively about that, so in that sense it was a different topic.</p>
<p>[For readers who donâ€™t know what that is, if youâ€™re talking about the probability of events occurring--letâ€™s say youâ€™re talking about the probability of a movie making a certain amount of money--there may be a mean amount of money that a movie makes or that a movie of that type makes. Then there will be fluctuations around it; some movies will make more, some movies will make less. The normal distribution is a distribution of the revenues that would follow a bell curve and the long-tailed distribution differs. One of the important respects that it differs in is that it has a lot more results that are far from the average that you would expect in a normal distribution. So if the average movie makes $1,000,000 or to be more realistic letâ€™s say the average movie makes $50,000,000 and if it was normally distributed you would have, depending on the variance, but letâ€™s just say you would have a certain number that make 40 or would make 60 and another small number would make 30 or 70 and you have a very small number indeed--probably practically zero--that would make $500,000,000. In Hollywood the way it really works is there are more that differ that far from the median than you would have if it were a normal distribution. Thatâ€™s what they call a long-tailed distribution--the number of occurrences that are far from the average is much higher than you would expect with the normal distribution. -- LM]</p>
<p>So that applies in many areas of life as well. I think that translated into what we were just talking about, it means that these little minor incidents can have major effects on you. Itâ€™s not all kind of pushed toward the mean effect, which is just going into my office and doing more physics.</p>
<p>ROBERTS Yes, I think that if you take the different things that have happened to you and you measured their effect, the effects will have a power-law distribution. A tiny number will have a huge effect and . . .</p>
<p>MLODINOW Yes.</p>
