				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I started eating honey at bedtime to improve my sleep, my fasting blood sugar values suddenly improved. Alternate-day fasting had pushed them into the mid-80s; now they were often in the high 70s, values I had never seen before. Without long walks and alternate-day fasting, <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">my fasting blood sugar values would have been more than 100</a>, which is pre-diabetic.</p>
<p>This made me wonder: Does bad sleep cause diabetes? Plenty of evidence, I found, supports this idea. <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/health/conditions/diabetes/lack-of-sleep-can-lead-to-diabetes/" target="_blank">Here is one example</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just three consecutive nights of inadequate sleep can elevate a person&#8217;s risk [of diabetes] to a degree roughly equivalent to gaining 20 to 30 pounds, according to a 2007 study at the University of Chicago. . . .This revelation backs up previous research from Yale and the New England Research Institutes, which showed that people who clock six hours or less of sleep a night are twice as likely to develop diabetes in their lifetime as those who snooze seven hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131001105059.htm" target="_blank">Here is another</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the study, published in the October issue of the Journal SLEEP, short sleepers reported a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes, in addition to obesity and frequent mental distress, compared with optimal sleepers who reported sleeping seven to nine hours on average in a 24-hour period. The same was true for long sleepers, and the associations with coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes were even more pronounced with more sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe there is something to it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/28/effect-of-alternate-day-fasting-on-a-friend/" target="_blank">blogged about benefits of alternate-day fasting</a>, a software engineer named Brandon Berg <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/28/effect-of-alternate-day-fasting-on-a-friend/#comment-1132097" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had had plantar warts for a couple of years prior to starting IF (eating in a four-hour window each night). They cleared up almost immediately.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had never heard about this effect of fasting. And the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_wart" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry on plantar warts</a> said nothing about this. I asked Brandon for details.<span id="more-11088"></span></p>
<p><strong>When and where did this happen?</strong></p>
<p>I was working full time while also attending college with a 12-hour schedule or so. That may or may not be relevant; I was under a lot of stress, both in terms of the pressure to serve both masters, and the sleep I sacrificed to make it happen. So that may have contributed to my development of the warts. I actually don&#8217;t remember whether I developed them before or after I went back to school, but I was definitely in school when they went away. I was 23 when they disappeared, and I lived in Seattle at the time. This was back in 2004, so I&#8217;m a bit fuzzy on the details.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have any idea what had caused the warts?</strong></p>
<div>Presumably a viral infection, since that&#8217;s what causes warts, isn&#8217;t it? I did a lot of walking around barefoot when I lived with my parents before going off to college in 1998; maybe I was infected then, and carried the virus asymptomatically until the stress triggered the development of the warts? But again, I don&#8217;t remember whether they were there when I went back to school.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Had you tried other ways of getting rid of the plantar warts?</span></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I might have tried apple cider vinegar on a select few. I distinctly remember that working for a wart on my thumb, but the ones on my feet were too numerous to treat them all that way. I never saw a doctor about them, since I always figured they&#8217;d just go away sooner or later, and they didn&#8217;t bother me that much.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Why did you do the intermittent fasting?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>This was back when the studies about IF extending lifespan in mice first started hitting the media. Or the first time I was aware of them, anyway. Living longer sounded good to me.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Did you expect it to affect your plantar warts?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I had no particular expectation that it would affect the warts.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How did others react to the fact that the IF got rid of the plantar warts?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I lived alone, so I never really told anyone else about them. I&#8217;ve mentioned this to a couple of people in passing, but don&#8217;t recall any notable reaction, other than &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s interesting,&#8221; or something similar.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How fast did they clear up? (= what does &#8220;almost immediately&#8221; mean?)<span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t remember, exactly. It was definitely within a month. I checked my email archives and see that in 2008 I said that it took less than a week. I remember mentioning this to a friend on ICQ back when it happened, and I *may* still have the logs from that on a hard drive in my closet, but I currently have no way to access it since I just moved to Tokyo and only have a notebook with no eSATA port, and I&#8217;m not planning on getting a desktop until I find a permanent apartment. Sorry I can&#8217;t be more precise here. Obviously the probability that it was a coincidence is much lower if they cleared up in a week than if they cleared up in a month.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How do you explain their disappearance?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not sure. It&#8217;s entirely possible that they&#8217;d run their course and it was just their time to go. My pet theory is autophagy: Starved for protein, my body started scavenging for expendable tissue and resorbed the warts. There were two small wart-like growths&#8211;one on my thumbprint and one on my nose&#8211;that persisted for years afterwards, so it&#8217;s definitely not a surefire cure.</div>
<div></div>
<div>On a related note&#8211;and this also may be purely coincidental&#8211;the last two times I&#8217;ve felt a cold coming on, I tried to combat it with a full-day fast, on the theory that this would ramp up my cellular resistance to oxidative stress and reduce the severity of my symptoms. In both cases, I did have a much less severe cold than I usually do, with symptoms reduced to a more or less negligible level by the next day, where I usually get 3-5 days of moderately severe symptoms.</div>
<div></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Winkler described his first weeks of intermittent fasting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Annual physical July 2nd [2013], HDL 46, cholesterol 243, LDL 177. Doc pushing for statins. I&#8217;ve been taking 5000 IU D3, some zinc, eating vaguely low carb. Had a kid a couple years ago. Watched Eat Fast, Live Longer. Was blown away.</p>
<p>Decided to try intermittent fasting and use $500 USB ultrasound device (<a href="http://intelametrix.com/FullSite/" target="_blank">BodyMetrix</a>) for feedback. Conclusions after three weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s not hard. I&#8217;m eating within an 8-hour window. Usually try to eat first food at 9 AM, close the window 8 hours after. I&#8217;m hardly ever hungry. Now it&#8217;s like &#8220;oh, it&#8217;s 9, guess I should eat&#8221;. I&#8217;m not eating specially or restricting my intake.</li>
<li>Losing weight. About 237-&gt;231 in 20 days.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, the novelty was his BodyMetrix data (mm of subcutaneous fat). Here it is:<br />
<a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/winkler.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11238" alt="winkler" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/winkler-600x210.png" width="600" height="210" /></a></li>
<p>This shows fat loss from the thigh and waist; the chest measurements vary too much to see a trend. The BodyMetrix data and the weight data (237&#8211;>231) confirm each other. He also used an Omron measurement device that uses impedence to measure body fat. You hold it in your hands. Its data were too noisy to conclude anything.</p>
<p>All in all, Winkler&#8217;s scale did a good job of detecting weight loss, the BodyMetrix device added a bit (confirmed the weight loss was due at least partly to fat loss), and the Omron device added nothing. The BodyMetrix device is advertised with the claim &#8220;no embarrassing pinching&#8221; but I&#8217;m sure pinching (with calipers) to measure skinfold thickness would have been more accurate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nassim Taleb said this or something close to it on the first day of the Ancestral Health Symposium in Atlanta, which was yesterday. Danielle Fong told me something similar last week: We should use all of our metabolic pathways. Of course it is hard to know what metabolic pathways you are using. In contrast, Taleb&#8217;s point &#8212; not original with him, but a new way (at least to me) of summarizing research &#8212; is easily applied.</p>
<p>What I know overwhelmingly supports Taleb&#8217;s point. 1. When I did the Shangri-La Diet the first time, I was stunned how little hunger I felt. This wasn&#8217;t bad &#8212; presumably my set point had been too high, lack of hunger reflected the dropping set point, it was good to know how to lower the set point &#8212; but it was dreary, not feeling hunger. It was as if life had gone from color to black and white. Something was missing. 2. Data supporting the health benefits of intermittent fasting, which produces more hunger than the control condition. 3. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/28/effect-of-alternate-day-fasting-on-a-friend/" target="_blank">The experience of my friend</a> who had great benefits from alternate-day fasting. He told me he had never felt hunger before, at least of that magnitude. A great increase in hunger, in other words, happened at exactly the same time as a great improvement in health.</p>
<p>Obviously Taleb is talking about hunger caused by lack of food, rather than hunger caused by learned association (if you eat at noon every day you will become hungry at noon, if you eat every time you enter Store X, you will be come hungry when you enter Store X, the existence of this effect is why they are called appetizers). The Shangri-La Diet reduces your set point but only if your set point controls when/how much you eat is this going to make a difference. So to lose weight you need to do two things: 1. Lower your set point. 2. Lower your weight to your set point. While SLD certainly does #1, it does not do #2. You can make sure your weight is near your set point if you feel strong hunger if you don&#8217;t eat for a while.</p>
<p>Taleb&#8217;s comment suggests focussing on the outcome of fasting, rather than on its duration or frequency. Instead of fasting every other day (or whatever), fast until you feel strong hunger. How often you need to do this, how strong the hunger should be, are questions to answer via trial and error.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been doing <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/health/intermittent-fasting/" target="_blank">alternate day fasting</a> for about two months. I find it very easy. In several ways it&#8217;s <strong>easier</strong> than eating every day:</p>
<ul>
<li>save time</li>
<li>save money</li>
<li>less constrained on eating days</li>
<li>a little more hungry than usual on fasting days (up to a point hunger is pleasant &#8212; when the Shangri-La Diet wiped out all my hunger, I didn&#8217;t like it)</li>
<li>sense of accomplishment when I wake up after a fasting day (<em>I did it</em>)</li>
<li>food tastes better</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe my friends are unusually tolerant but I have yet to encounter a serious negative. Yesterday, a fasting day, I happily watched a friend eat dinner. I had two bites out of curiosity. I saw nothing to suggest it made her uncomfortable I wasn&#8217;t eating.</p>
<p>However, a different friend has told me that alternate day fasting made her sick. She did it for about three months, felt worse and worse, and finally stopped. She believes it works less well for women than for men. I suspect a heavy exercise routine (she ran a lot) made alternate day fasting more difficult. But there is also the best-selling book <a href="http://thefastdiet.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>The FastDiet</em></a>. It has two authors, a man (Michael Mosely, a doctor) and a woman (Mimi Spencer, a journalist). The book contains a remarkably short and remarkably unenthusiastic description of Spencer&#8217;s experience with intermittent fasting. Maybe it didn&#8217;t agree with her, either.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong> How does exercise fit in with all this fasting?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> I do Iyengar yoga every day, about 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> I assume he drank water. Did he consume any liquid calories or probiotics (Yakult?) on his fasting days?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> Yes, water. I replace electrolytes, but that&#8217;s for other </span>reasons.  (I don&#8217;t regulate electrolytes well.)  There may have been 8 or 10 days in the last 9 months when I had a very small amount of food on a fasting day &#8212; a little yogurt or a little rice &amp; sauerkraut, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> What did he eat on non-fasting days?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> Breakfast of stir-fry + egg + some fruit &#038; yoghurt &#038; nuts &#038; flax seeds.  Maybe I break that into two meals or maybe not. Dinner of &#8230; veggies/rice/chicken or &#8230; something like that. [He didn't change what he ate when he started alternate-day fasting.]</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> Something is missing in the story. He didn’t get to be an Ivy League math professor by being confused, exhausted, overwhelmed and depressed all the time. Were his indigestion and tiredness increasing in severity before he started the diet?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> I was severely ADHD all my life, and collapsed in the early 2000&#8242;s. I turned out to suffer from heavy metal poisoning: mercury, lead and a little bit of arsenic. I&#8217;ve been detoxing for a number of years with steady improvement. As to how I managed to become an Ivy League math professor, that&#8217;s not unusual. There are a lot of us. There is a subtype of ADHD called &#8220;with hyperfocus&#8221;. Hyperfocus is a mild form of the Asperger&#8217;s &#8220;little professor&#8221; syndrome, in which a person is completely consumed by one subject, at the expense of anything else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine named Dave saw the BBC program <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvdbtt_eat-fast-live-longer-hd_shortfilms" target="_blank">Eat, Fast and Live Longer</a> ten months ago. The program promotes intermittent fasting for better health. It sounded good. Already he often went a day without food. Some Brahmins in South India had eaten this way for millennia – which suggested it made some sense. It wasn&#8217;t a fad. Alternate day fasting was simpler than the &#8220;fast 2 days per week&#8221; regimen the TV show ended with. He started alternate day fasting immediately.<span id="more-11055"></span></p>
<p>It was easy to start. The first day was hard. He had painful stomach cramps, but hunger was not a problem. The second day of fasting was slightly difficult, again because of stomach cramps. By the third day of fasting, there was no problem. He tried eating a small meal (400-500 calories) on fasting days but it just made him hungry. It was easier to not eat at all.</p>
<p>Within two weeks, his head felt clearer, he had more energy, and he felt lighter. Lots of people say the same thing in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alternate+day+fasting&amp;oq=alternate+day+fasting&amp;gs_l=youtube.3..0l10.3382.7630.0.7826.29.21.1.0.0.0.551.3506.2j1j3j5j0j1.12.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.yzfftlOFcio" target="_blank">YouTube videos about the diet</a>. He had more <em>mental</em> energy. Before the diet, he easily became overwhelmed. In spite of a highly technical background (he was a math professor at an Ivy League school), something as simple as writing a computer program would exhaust him. When he tried to tackle a technical problem, he would get overwhelmed, exhausted, and would quickly give up. For example, he has written tens of thousands of lines of computer code. Writing in a language he knew very well, he’d be unable to get beyond 10-15 lines. Within three months of starting the diet, he took an online class (an introductory class about R) and was surprised he could do the work. (He had started the class to take his mind off of family issues he had to deal with. He wanted to do something for himself.) After that, he took two more online classes, about cryptography and about functional programming. He finished them and did well. He was elated.</p>
<p>Several other things started improving. He’d had GERD (&#8220;acid reflux&#8221;). He had poor digestion at night, would wake up with an “acidic stomach” and burning in the back of his throat and mouth. He’d had this all his life (he’s now in his fifties). In his twenties, several health experts told him he had digestive problems. When he started alternate day fasting, he didn’t change the time of day that he ate. After two or three months, his GERD entirely went away.</p>
<p>Another improvement was athlete’s foot. He&#8217;d had it since his mid-twenties. He had it all over his feet, not just the toes. He&#8217;d done many things to get rid of it. None of them worked, at least permanently. After two months of alternate day fasting, he noticed improvement. Over the following months his athlete&#8217;s foot continued to improve. However, three weeks ago he started drinking a half-gallon of yogurt per week. Within two weeks of starting that, his athlete’s foot got much worse. Eating much more yogurt was the only dietary change he’d made. The connection (yogurt increased athlete&#8217;s foot) is plausible because athlete&#8217;s foot is due to one or more fungi, fungi need sulfur to grow, and yogurt contains a lot of cysteine, which contains sulfur. (<a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/natural-therapy-using-yogurt-treat-fungal-infections-3264848.html?cat=68" target="_blank">A natural therapy site</a> gets it exactly wrong: &#8220;Continuing to consume yogurt . . . on a daily basis after the immediate problem has been solved may prevent future outbreaks&#8221;).</p>
<p>His food allergies started going away. Wheat was the worst. After eating wheat, he got brain fog, agitation (difficulty sitting still), and difficulty focusing. He would start having violent imagery; for example, his dreams will get quite violent. A laboratory test showed that he had astronomical levels of an immune response to gluten peptides. Another food allergy of his was dairy. It caused agitation, difficulty concentrating, and depression (in the sense that you feel like you want to kill yourself). Before he figured this out, there were times he consumed a quart of milk in a short period of time. Half an hour later, he got these three symptoms, including scary depression (“there’s no way out”). Now he can consume both wheat and dairy without trouble. His wheat allergy isn’t entirely gone but it is much better. He hasn&#8217;t noticed any allergic reaction to dairy, even large amounts.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d had blood sugar problems for a long time. He&#8217;d had hypoglycemia since his late twenties. After strenuous exercise, he could come close to passing out. He would eat fruit to keep this from happening. He’d be lying on the floor, drag himself to eat a piece of fruit, and instantly feel better. After a meal, he’d feel tired, then eat something sweet and feel a rush of energy. He had a regular need for sweet things, including dessert. Whenever he had dinner, he’d really want dessert. About eight months after he started alternate day fasting, he realized that his craving for something sweet went away. One day it was present, the next day gone. Instead of feeling tired after a big meal, he felt calm.</p>
<p>He thinks that he must have had a candida infection and his gut is healing. This would explain the allergies going away and the GERD improvement. He hadn’t expected these changes. He just started it because it fit his eating patterns and was more regular.</p>
<p>“I’ve experienced hunger for the first time,” he says. If he doesn’t eat the morning of a day he’s supposed to eat, he feels ravenously hungry – a new experience. A crystal-clear sense of hunger, which is pleasant. It&#8217;s pleasant to know what hunger is. He takes meals more seriously, because that’s the day he’s eating. He pays more attention to his food.</p>
<p>I found his experience far more convincing than anything else I&#8217;d heard about intermittent fasting. It was sustainable, it was easy, the benefits were unexpected, no ideology was involved, all sorts of things got better. It was as if this was the eating pattern our bodies were built for. My friend&#8217;s experience led me to try alternate day fasting, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/30/alternate-day-fasting-improved-my-blood-sugar/" target="_blank">as I&#8217;ve said</a>. After a few days my fasting blood sugar substantially improved (from the mid-90s to the mid-80s). Within weeks, my HbA1c went from 5.8 to 5.4. I haven&#8217;t noticed mental changes but my brain test scores have improved for reasons I cannot yet explain (there are several possible explanations).</p>

The initial thought when tracking yourself is &#8220;keep things constant&#8221; so that the data from different days will be more comparable. This makes sense if you are doing an experiment where different days get different treatments. It does not make sense when you are not doing an experiment. This self-tracker doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing any experiments, so he should allow his life to be messy if he wants to learn more.</span></li>

This is an example of the way economists usually ignore innovation, which benefits from new ideas and skills. Innovations usually derive from new combinations of things. To open a new business (an instance of economic freedom) it really helps to have a new good or service. New cuisines (immigrants open restaurants) is just the beginning.</li>

<p>This graph shows my HbA1c values in recent years. After a lot of variation, they settled down to 5.8, which was the measurement a month ago. 5.8 isn&#8217;t terrible &#8212; below 6.0 is sometimes called &#8220;okay&#8221;) &#8212; but there is room for improvement. In <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908359" target="_blank">a large 2010 study</a>, average HbA1c was 5.5. The study suggested that a HbA1c of about 5.0 was ideal.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago I started alternate-day fasting (= eating much less than usual every other day) for entirely different reasons. <span id="more-10789"></span>Although people sometimes find alternate-day fasting unpleasant (they get too hungry on the fast days), I haven&#8217;t noticed this. I blogged recently that within days of starting, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=10784" target="_blank">my fasting blood sugar levels greatly improved</a>. Yesterday I got my HbA1c measured again. It was 5.4 &#8212; much better. This supports the idea that alternate-day fasting is helping a lot. HbA1c measures glucose in the blood over 8-12 weeks so there could easily be more improvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether intermittent fasting can be used as a tool to prevent diabetes in those individuals at high risk or to prevent progression in those recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes remains a tantalizing notion,&#8221; <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Health-Wire/fasting-diabetes-heart-disease-cholesterol/2013/04/29/id/501911" target="_blank">said</a> an author of <a href="http://dvd.sagepub.com/content/13/2/68.long" target="_blank">a recent paper on the subject</a>. My experience suggests that you can easily find out for yourself if intermittent fasting will help. It took only a week to be sure that my fasting blood sugar had improved and only three weeks to have a good idea that my HbA1c has improved. My improvement was almost as fast and clear as what happens when people with a vitamin deficiency are given the vitamin they need.</p>
<p>There are countless ways of doing alternate-day fasting (or, more generally, intermittent fasting). A clinical trial usually tests just one way, which you may not want to copy exactly. My results suggest that blood sugar measurements provide an easy way to tell if your particular version of intermittent fasting is helping.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I gave a talk at a Quantified Self Meetup in San Francisco titled &#8220;Why is my blood sugar high?&#8221; (PowerPoint <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=10770" target="_blank">here</a> and <a "href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10760363/2013-06-26%20Why%20is%20My%20Blood%20Sugar%20High.pptx" target="_blank">here</a>). My main point was that alternate-day fasting (eating much less than usual every other day) quickly brought my fasting blood sugar level from the mid-90s to the low 80s, which is where I wanted it. I was unsure how to do this and had tried several things that hadn&#8217;t worked.</p>
<p>Not in the talk is an explanation of my results in terms of setpoint (blood sugar setpoint, not body fat setpoint). Your body tries to maintain a certain blood sugar level &#8212; that&#8217;s obvious. Not obvious at all is what controls the setpoint. This question is usually ignored &#8212; for example, in Wikipedia&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_regulation" target="_blank">blood sugar regulation</a> entry. Maybe Type 2 diabetes occurs because the blood sugar setpoint is too high. If we can find out what environmental events control the setpoint, we will be in a much better position to prevent and reverse Type 2 diabetes (as with obesity).</p>
<p>A few years ago, I discovered that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/" target="_blank">walking an hour per day improved my fasting blood sugar</a>. Does walking lower the setpoint? I didn&#8217;t ask this question, a curious omission from the author of <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>. If walking lowered the setpoint, walking every other day might have the same effect as walking every day.</p>
<p>I was pushed toward this line of thought because alternate-day fasting seems to lower the blood-sugar setpoint. After I started alternate-day fasting, it took about three days for my fasting blood sugar to reach a new lower level. After that, it was low every day, not just after fast days. My experience suggests that the blood-sugar setpoint depends on what your blood sugar is. When your blood sugar is high, the setpoint becomes higher; when your blood sugar is low, the setpoint becomes lower. Tim Lundeen had told me something similar to this.</p>
<p>If you tried to lower your fasting blood sugar and succeeded, I hope you will say in the comments how you did this. I tried three things that didn&#8217;t work: darker bedroom, Vitamin B supplement, and cinnamon. Eating low carb raises<strong> </strong>fasting blood sugar, <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2011/11/safe-starches-symposium-dr-ron-rosedale/" target="_blank">according to Paul Jaminet</a>.</p>
