				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/is-this-why-smoking-is-the-number-one-predictor-of-heart-disease/" target="_blank">Mr. Heisenbug</a> says that smoking is the best predictor of heart disease. (Not quite. A high Agatston score is a better predictor. <a href="http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1136854" target="_blank">For example</a>.) It is the best lifestyle predictor. People who smoke, according to <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/low-i-q-predicts-heart-disease/" target="_blank">this</a>, have a six-fold increased risk of heart disease compared to non-smokers.</p>
<p>Why would this be? Heisenbug points to a study that found that when smokers quit, the microbial diversity of their gut increased. He speculates that (a) smoking decreases microbial diversity, which is quite plausible and (b) decreased microbial diversity increases heart disease &#8212; which has some plausibility.</p>
<p>I commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would be interesting to find other factors that have a big effect on microbial diversity and whether they are also associated with heart disease. The idea that smoking causes heart disease via its microbial effects predicts, or at least suggests, that a change that reduces microbial diversity a lot will increase heart disease.</p></blockquote>
<p>Heisenbug replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only lifestyle factor that we can safely say leads to a lack of microbial diversity is a diet that is low in fermentable fiber. And fiber intake is consistently linked (negatively) with heart disease. I’ve never seen data linking lower overall diversity to a decrease in risk for any disease. And lots showing the opposite.</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>The stuff about diversity (fiber intake increases diversity and is associated with less heart disease, many associations of more diversity with less risk of Disease X, no associations in the opposite direction) is substantial support for your idea, in my opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>His theory, in other words, made a prediction that turned out to be correct. A large fraction of what we&#8217;re told about health hasn&#8217;t led to any correct predictions. Here is an idea about how to prevent heart disease, a major killer, that there is actually reason to believe. And Heisenbug can say whatever he wants, in contrast to a heart disease expert quoted, say, in the <i>New York Times</i>, who is under pressure to say certain things. So we can take what he says at face value.</p>
<p>Heisenbug replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I agree. Especially because there’s never been a good explanation WHY fiber has that effect on [he means "association with" -- Seth] heart disease.</p></blockquote>
<p>Suddenly I am a lot more interested in microbial diversity and the association of fiber and heart disease. Smoking has countless health effects &#8212; it increases many cancers, for example. Obviously it increases lung and throat cancer. This means there are many ways it could cause heart disease. Fiber is quite different than smoking and as far as I know has no effect on lung and throat cancer. If it could be established that fiber <strong>causes</strong> a reduction in heart disease (not just is associated with a reduction), that would be considerable evidence (but far from proof, of course) that microbial diversity influences heart disease.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I started eating honey at bedtime to improve my sleep, my fasting blood sugar values suddenly improved. Alternate-day fasting had pushed them into the mid-80s; now they were often in the high 70s, values I had never seen before. Without long walks and alternate-day fasting, <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">my fasting blood sugar values would have been more than 100</a>, which is pre-diabetic.</p>
<p>This made me wonder: Does bad sleep cause diabetes? Plenty of evidence, I found, supports this idea. <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/health/conditions/diabetes/lack-of-sleep-can-lead-to-diabetes/" target="_blank">Here is one example</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just three consecutive nights of inadequate sleep can elevate a person&#8217;s risk [of diabetes] to a degree roughly equivalent to gaining 20 to 30 pounds, according to a 2007 study at the University of Chicago. . . .This revelation backs up previous research from Yale and the New England Research Institutes, which showed that people who clock six hours or less of sleep a night are twice as likely to develop diabetes in their lifetime as those who snooze seven hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131001105059.htm" target="_blank">Here is another</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the study, published in the October issue of the Journal SLEEP, short sleepers reported a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes, in addition to obesity and frequent mental distress, compared with optimal sleepers who reported sleeping seven to nine hours on average in a 24-hour period. The same was true for long sleepers, and the associations with coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes were even more pronounced with more sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe there is something to it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese friend of mine had a cold. After a few weeks, she was still sick.  I suggested she eat meat &#8212; it would provide the amino acids needed to make antibodies. She did want to eat meat, she said, but her mom thought that meat was bad for a sick person &#8212; an idea from Traditional Chinese Medicine, I guess.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a desire to eat meat. That was odd; I didn&#8217;t usually feel that way. I ate all the meat in the refrigerator (slices of cured meat) but it wasn&#8217;t much. I ate three eggs. That, too, was odd &#8212; usually one egg is plenty. In the evening, I distinctly wanted more meat but decided against going out to get some. This morning I woke up with the flu. I could tell by the joint pain. <em>So that&#8217;s what joint pain is</em>, I thought. I&#8217;d read about flu and <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">written about it</a>, but, before this morning, cannot remember having it.  <em>H</em><em>ow is the flu different from a cold?</em> I once tried to find out. I might not have come down with today&#8217;s case of the flu were it not for two events: yesterday&#8217;s decision not to eat meat; and, the day before, running into a friend who had just left the house after being home-bound for four days with the flu. He shook my hand twice.</p>
<p>Humans (including me) are exceedingly gullible; my evolutionary explanation is that this makes us easier to lead. Gullibility &#8212; we believe something just because an authority says it &#8212; is cement. It keeps members of a group together. Better that 10 people do one thing (e.g., live in one place) than ten things, in many cases. Pointless to waste time on unresolvable and divisive arguments. Doctors, both Western and Eastern, take advantage of our gullibility. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/08/dangerous-noise/" target="_blank">As my friend says</a>, &#8220;doctors hurt you&#8221; because they tell you to do something different from what you want to do (e.g., eat meat). What you <em>want</em> to do is actual wisdom. We&#8217;ve been shaped by evolution to want to do what is good for us and what we want to eat is a giant clue to what we should eat. In nutrition research, this line of thinking, which is called <em>dietary self-selection</em> research, is nearly moribund, in spite of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC537465/pdf/canmedaj00208-0035.pdf" target="_blank">a great 1939 article about what happened when young children ate what they wanted</a>. The idea that we want to eat what we should eat is what first led me to think <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/the-unami-hypothesis-why-i-believe-fermented-foods-are-necessary-for-health/" target="_blank">we need to eat fermented foods to be healthy</a>. Fermented foods, much more than other foods, satisfy our desire for sour, umami-flavored and complex-flavored foods. For example, it is easy to produce complexity via fermentation; it is hard to produce it in other ways.</p>
<p>As for my flu, I went to the store and got pork and duck. By evening I felt much better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/28/effect-of-alternate-day-fasting-on-a-friend/" target="_blank">blogged about benefits of alternate-day fasting</a>, a software engineer named Brandon Berg <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/28/effect-of-alternate-day-fasting-on-a-friend/#comment-1132097" target="_blank">commented</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had had plantar warts for a couple of years prior to starting IF (eating in a four-hour window each night). They cleared up almost immediately.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had never heard about this effect of fasting. And the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_wart" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry on plantar warts</a> said nothing about this. I asked Brandon for details.<span id="more-11088"></span></p>
<p><strong>When and where did this happen?</strong></p>
<p>I was working full time while also attending college with a 12-hour schedule or so. That may or may not be relevant; I was under a lot of stress, both in terms of the pressure to serve both masters, and the sleep I sacrificed to make it happen. So that may have contributed to my development of the warts. I actually don&#8217;t remember whether I developed them before or after I went back to school, but I was definitely in school when they went away. I was 23 when they disappeared, and I lived in Seattle at the time. This was back in 2004, so I&#8217;m a bit fuzzy on the details.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have any idea what had caused the warts?</strong></p>
<div>Presumably a viral infection, since that&#8217;s what causes warts, isn&#8217;t it? I did a lot of walking around barefoot when I lived with my parents before going off to college in 1998; maybe I was infected then, and carried the virus asymptomatically until the stress triggered the development of the warts? But again, I don&#8217;t remember whether they were there when I went back to school.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Had you tried other ways of getting rid of the plantar warts?</span></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I might have tried apple cider vinegar on a select few. I distinctly remember that working for a wart on my thumb, but the ones on my feet were too numerous to treat them all that way. I never saw a doctor about them, since I always figured they&#8217;d just go away sooner or later, and they didn&#8217;t bother me that much.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Why did you do the intermittent fasting?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>This was back when the studies about IF extending lifespan in mice first started hitting the media. Or the first time I was aware of them, anyway. Living longer sounded good to me.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Did you expect it to affect your plantar warts?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I had no particular expectation that it would affect the warts.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How did others react to the fact that the IF got rid of the plantar warts?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I lived alone, so I never really told anyone else about them. I&#8217;ve mentioned this to a couple of people in passing, but don&#8217;t recall any notable reaction, other than &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s interesting,&#8221; or something similar.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How fast did they clear up? (= what does &#8220;almost immediately&#8221; mean?)<span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t remember, exactly. It was definitely within a month. I checked my email archives and see that in 2008 I said that it took less than a week. I remember mentioning this to a friend on ICQ back when it happened, and I *may* still have the logs from that on a hard drive in my closet, but I currently have no way to access it since I just moved to Tokyo and only have a notebook with no eSATA port, and I&#8217;m not planning on getting a desktop until I find a permanent apartment. Sorry I can&#8217;t be more precise here. Obviously the probability that it was a coincidence is much lower if they cleared up in a week than if they cleared up in a month.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How do you explain their disappearance?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not sure. It&#8217;s entirely possible that they&#8217;d run their course and it was just their time to go. My pet theory is autophagy: Starved for protein, my body started scavenging for expendable tissue and resorbed the warts. There were two small wart-like growths&#8211;one on my thumbprint and one on my nose&#8211;that persisted for years afterwards, so it&#8217;s definitely not a surefire cure.</div>
<div></div>
<div>On a related note&#8211;and this also may be purely coincidental&#8211;the last two times I&#8217;ve felt a cold coming on, I tried to combat it with a full-day fast, on the theory that this would ramp up my cellular resistance to oxidative stress and reduce the severity of my symptoms. In both cases, I did have a much less severe cold than I usually do, with symptoms reduced to a more or less negligible level by the next day, where I usually get 3-5 days of moderately severe symptoms.</div>
<div></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a friend with life-altering hyperacusis, a hearing problem where ordinary sounds can cause pain. It started after she worked in a noisy workplace for three years.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are always told about things they should do for good health: eat right, exercise, wear sunscreen, don&#8217;t smoke,&#8221; said my friend. &#8220;But they are almost never warned about loud noise, and if they are, it&#8217;s only about hearing loss far off in the future.&#8221; Her healthcare philosophy is <em>doctors hurt you</em>, which she finds so self-evident that she can barely explain why she believes it.</p>
<p>Her husband has hyperacusis, too, even worse than hers. His came from too many rock concerts. He sought medical treatment for a disorder that even Google has barely heard of, and now takes a staggering amount of pain medicine. His philosophy, at least historically, has been <em>doctors help you</em>. She has done her best to keep him away from doctors, but there is no doubt that, through a combination of bad advice and bad treatment, doctors have made his health much worse. (The pain medicines do reduce pain &#8212; but much of his pain was caused by doctors.) Judging by his and her experience, <em>doctors hurt you</em> is more accurate.</p>
<p>I am writing this in the loudest Starbucks I have ever been in, in New York City. (I have been in hundreds of Starbucks.) Three employees have told me they cannot control the volume of the music. Even with my Bose noise-cancelling headphones, it is too loud. I must find somewhere else. A friend who used to work at Starbucks disputes their claim that they cannot control the volume. She says the content of the music is set by corporate but the volume is controllable at individual stores. A customer at the loud Starbucks told me he thought the employees made the music so loud to drive customers away.</p>
<p>Exhibit 1 in the argument that doctors hurt you is <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html" target="_blank">tonsillectomies</a>, probably the most common operation ever. Your tonsils are part of your immune system &#8212; removing them makes as much sense as removing part of your brain. Tonsillectomies remained common long after it was clear that tonsils were part of the immune system. Perhaps doctors didn&#8217;t understand high school biology? Or they didn&#8217;t care? Either answer suggests that doctors should be avoided.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I posted a link to <a href="http://www.dumblittleman.com/2013/08/50-studies-suggest-that-magnesium.html#more" target="_blank">an article about magnesium deficiency</a> (&#8220;50 studies suggest that magnesium deficiency is killing us&#8221;), a reader who wishes to be anonymous looked into it.</p>
<blockquote><p>After reading your post about magnesium oil, I read up on it, and thought I&#8217;d try it. I didn&#8217;t notice any difference, but I have a report. In my reading, I came across stories of people who sprayed the oil on wounds.</p>
<p>I have a recurring minor irritation that, when it occurs, usually takes weeks to heal. Passing a large stool can cause small tears in the rectum, so small they don&#8217;t even bleed but nonetheless can be felt.  If another stool, even a regular-sized one, passes before the tears heal, they are painfully re-opened, though not re-opened fully. The pain is not severe but is, frankly, a pain in the ***.   In my case it usually takes weeks for the tears to completely heal.</p>
<p>I was a couple weeks into this cycle when my bottle of magnesium oil arrived.  I had read that it promotes healing and some people spray it on wounds.  So I sprayed it on my irritated area once a day for three days, and on the third day when I passed a stool there was no pain!   Never before had it healed so quickly, and I&#8217;ve had this problem at least once a year for over ten years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m impressed. This resembles a theory making an unlikely prediction that turns out to be true. Other examples of magnesium benefits are <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/04/11/paging-dr-google-magnesium-constipation-and-subarachnoid-hemorrages/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/23/scott-adams-magnesium-and-knee-pain/" target="_blank">here</a>. Maybe magnesium will improve my sleep. That should be easy to test.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows that diabetes is associated with obesity, probably because obesity causes diabetes. However, thin people also become diabetic. A clue to why is provided by the correlation between diabetes and what are called &#8220;persistent organic pollutants&#8221; (POPs). POPs are man-made organic compounds, usually pesticides, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans.</p>
<p><a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/7/1638.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">A 2006 study</a> using NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2002) data found very strong associations between levels of these chemicals and diabetes. For example, a risk ratio of 30. These associations persisted even when the data was stratified in all sorts of ways. The scariest result came from people who had BMI &lt; 25. Looking only at such people, those above the 90th percentile for amount of POPs had 16 times the risk of diabetes as those below the 25th percentile. Here is something associated with thin people getting diabetes.</p>
<p>Does the association exist because POPs cause diabetes? You might argue that POP exposure is correlated with poverty (poor people are more exposed), poor people exercise less than rich people, and lack of exercise causes diabetes. However, Agent Orange exposure among soldiers is associated with diabetes. That is unlikely to be due to confounding with poverty or lack of exercise.</p>
<p>Everyone has these chemicals in their body, but almost no one knows how much. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m in the 10th percentile or the 90th percentile. If I&#8217;m in the 90th percentile, what can I do about it? A good place for self-measurement and tracking.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Winkler described his first weeks of intermittent fasting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Annual physical July 2nd [2013], HDL 46, cholesterol 243, LDL 177. Doc pushing for statins. I&#8217;ve been taking 5000 IU D3, some zinc, eating vaguely low carb. Had a kid a couple years ago. Watched Eat Fast, Live Longer. Was blown away.</p>
<p>Decided to try intermittent fasting and use $500 USB ultrasound device (<a href="http://intelametrix.com/FullSite/" target="_blank">BodyMetrix</a>) for feedback. Conclusions after three weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s not hard. I&#8217;m eating within an 8-hour window. Usually try to eat first food at 9 AM, close the window 8 hours after. I&#8217;m hardly ever hungry. Now it&#8217;s like &#8220;oh, it&#8217;s 9, guess I should eat&#8221;. I&#8217;m not eating specially or restricting my intake.</li>
<li>Losing weight. About 237-&gt;231 in 20 days.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, the novelty was his BodyMetrix data (mm of subcutaneous fat). Here it is:<br />
<a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/winkler.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11238" alt="winkler" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/winkler-600x210.png" width="600" height="210" /></a></li>
<p>This shows fat loss from the thigh and waist; the chest measurements vary too much to see a trend. The BodyMetrix data and the weight data (237&#8211;>231) confirm each other. He also used an Omron measurement device that uses impedence to measure body fat. You hold it in your hands. Its data were too noisy to conclude anything.</p>
<p>All in all, Winkler&#8217;s scale did a good job of detecting weight loss, the BodyMetrix device added a bit (confirmed the weight loss was due at least partly to fat loss), and the Omron device added nothing. The BodyMetrix device is advertised with the claim &#8220;no embarrassing pinching&#8221; but I&#8217;m sure pinching (with calipers) to measure skinfold thickness would have been more accurate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nassim Taleb said this or something close to it on the first day of the Ancestral Health Symposium in Atlanta, which was yesterday. Danielle Fong told me something similar last week: We should use all of our metabolic pathways. Of course it is hard to know what metabolic pathways you are using. In contrast, Taleb&#8217;s point &#8212; not original with him, but a new way (at least to me) of summarizing research &#8212; is easily applied.</p>
<p>What I know overwhelmingly supports Taleb&#8217;s point. 1. When I did the Shangri-La Diet the first time, I was stunned how little hunger I felt. This wasn&#8217;t bad &#8212; presumably my set point had been too high, lack of hunger reflected the dropping set point, it was good to know how to lower the set point &#8212; but it was dreary, not feeling hunger. It was as if life had gone from color to black and white. Something was missing. 2. Data supporting the health benefits of intermittent fasting, which produces more hunger than the control condition. 3. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/28/effect-of-alternate-day-fasting-on-a-friend/" target="_blank">The experience of my friend</a> who had great benefits from alternate-day fasting. He told me he had never felt hunger before, at least of that magnitude. A great increase in hunger, in other words, happened at exactly the same time as a great improvement in health.</p>
<p>Obviously Taleb is talking about hunger caused by lack of food, rather than hunger caused by learned association (if you eat at noon every day you will become hungry at noon, if you eat every time you enter Store X, you will be come hungry when you enter Store X, the existence of this effect is why they are called appetizers). The Shangri-La Diet reduces your set point but only if your set point controls when/how much you eat is this going to make a difference. So to lose weight you need to do two things: 1. Lower your set point. 2. Lower your weight to your set point. While SLD certainly does #1, it does not do #2. You can make sure your weight is near your set point if you feel strong hunger if you don&#8217;t eat for a while.</p>
<p>Taleb&#8217;s comment suggests focussing on the outcome of fasting, rather than on its duration or frequency. Instead of fasting every other day (or whatever), fast until you feel strong hunger. How often you need to do this, how strong the hunger should be, are questions to answer via trial and error.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been doing <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/health/intermittent-fasting/" target="_blank">alternate day fasting</a> for about two months. I find it very easy. In several ways it&#8217;s <strong>easier</strong> than eating every day:</p>
<ul>
<li>save time</li>
<li>save money</li>
<li>less constrained on eating days</li>
<li>a little more hungry than usual on fasting days (up to a point hunger is pleasant &#8212; when the Shangri-La Diet wiped out all my hunger, I didn&#8217;t like it)</li>
<li>sense of accomplishment when I wake up after a fasting day (<em>I did it</em>)</li>
<li>food tastes better</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe my friends are unusually tolerant but I have yet to encounter a serious negative. Yesterday, a fasting day, I happily watched a friend eat dinner. I had two bites out of curiosity. I saw nothing to suggest it made her uncomfortable I wasn&#8217;t eating.</p>
<p>However, a different friend has told me that alternate day fasting made her sick. She did it for about three months, felt worse and worse, and finally stopped. She believes it works less well for women than for men. I suspect a heavy exercise routine (she ran a lot) made alternate day fasting more difficult. But there is also the best-selling book <a href="http://thefastdiet.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>The FastDiet</em></a>. It has two authors, a man (Michael Mosely, a doctor) and a woman (Mimi Spencer, a journalist). The book contains a remarkably short and remarkably unenthusiastic description of Spencer&#8217;s experience with intermittent fasting. Maybe it didn&#8217;t agree with her, either.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/07/28/effect-of-alternate-day-fasting-on-a-friend/" target="_blank">I blogged about a friend</a> who derived great benefits from alternate-day fasting. There were several reader questions. I put them to my friend:</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> How does exercise fit in with all this fasting?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> I do Iyengar yoga every day, about 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> I assume he drank water. Did he consume any liquid calories or probiotics (Yakult?) on his fasting days?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> Yes, water. I replace electrolytes, but that&#8217;s for other </span>reasons.  (I don&#8217;t regulate electrolytes well.)  There may have been 8 or 10 days in the last 9 months when I had a very small amount of food on a fasting day &#8212; a little yogurt or a little rice &amp; sauerkraut, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> What did he eat on non-fasting days?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> Breakfast of stir-fry + egg + some fruit &#038; yoghurt &#038; nuts &#038; flax seeds.  Maybe I break that into two meals or maybe not. Dinner of &#8230; veggies/rice/chicken or &#8230; something like that. [He didn't change what he ate when he started alternate-day fasting.]</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> Something is missing in the story. He didn’t get to be an Ivy League math professor by being confused, exhausted, overwhelmed and depressed all the time. Were his indigestion and tiredness increasing in severity before he started the diet?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> I was severely ADHD all my life, and collapsed in the early 2000&#8242;s. I turned out to suffer from heavy metal poisoning: mercury, lead and a little bit of arsenic. I&#8217;ve been detoxing for a number of years with steady improvement. As to how I managed to become an Ivy League math professor, that&#8217;s not unusual. There are a lot of us. There is a subtype of ADHD called &#8220;with hyperfocus&#8221;. Hyperfocus is a mild form of the Asperger&#8217;s &#8220;little professor&#8221; syndrome, in which a person is completely consumed by one subject, at the expense of anything else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine named Dave saw the BBC program <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvdbtt_eat-fast-live-longer-hd_shortfilms" target="_blank">Eat, Fast and Live Longer</a> ten months ago. The program promotes intermittent fasting for better health. It sounded good. Already he often went a day without food. Some Brahmins in South India had eaten this way for millennia – which suggested it made some sense. It wasn&#8217;t a fad. Alternate day fasting was simpler than the &#8220;fast 2 days per week&#8221; regimen the TV show ended with. He started alternate day fasting immediately.<span id="more-11055"></span></p>
<p>It was easy to start. The first day was hard. He had painful stomach cramps, but hunger was not a problem. The second day of fasting was slightly difficult, again because of stomach cramps. By the third day of fasting, there was no problem. He tried eating a small meal (400-500 calories) on fasting days but it just made him hungry. It was easier to not eat at all.</p>
<p>Within two weeks, his head felt clearer, he had more energy, and he felt lighter. Lots of people say the same thing in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alternate+day+fasting&amp;oq=alternate+day+fasting&amp;gs_l=youtube.3..0l10.3382.7630.0.7826.29.21.1.0.0.0.551.3506.2j1j3j5j0j1.12.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.yzfftlOFcio" target="_blank">YouTube videos about the diet</a>. He had more <em>mental</em> energy. Before the diet, he easily became overwhelmed. In spite of a highly technical background (he was a math professor at an Ivy League school), something as simple as writing a computer program would exhaust him. When he tried to tackle a technical problem, he would get overwhelmed, exhausted, and would quickly give up. For example, he has written tens of thousands of lines of computer code. Writing in a language he knew very well, he’d be unable to get beyond 10-15 lines. Within three months of starting the diet, he took an online class (an introductory class about R) and was surprised he could do the work. (He had started the class to take his mind off of family issues he had to deal with. He wanted to do something for himself.) After that, he took two more online classes, about cryptography and about functional programming. He finished them and did well. He was elated.</p>
<p>Several other things started improving. He’d had GERD (&#8220;acid reflux&#8221;). He had poor digestion at night, would wake up with an “acidic stomach” and burning in the back of his throat and mouth. He’d had this all his life (he’s now in his fifties). In his twenties, several health experts told him he had digestive problems. When he started alternate day fasting, he didn’t change the time of day that he ate. After two or three months, his GERD entirely went away.</p>
<p>Another improvement was athlete’s foot. He&#8217;d had it since his mid-twenties. He had it all over his feet, not just the toes. He&#8217;d done many things to get rid of it. None of them worked, at least permanently. After two months of alternate day fasting, he noticed improvement. Over the following months his athlete&#8217;s foot continued to improve. However, three weeks ago he started drinking a half-gallon of yogurt per week. Within two weeks of starting that, his athlete’s foot got much worse. Eating much more yogurt was the only dietary change he’d made. The connection (yogurt increased athlete&#8217;s foot) is plausible because athlete&#8217;s foot is due to one or more fungi, fungi need sulfur to grow, and yogurt contains a lot of cysteine, which contains sulfur. (<a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/natural-therapy-using-yogurt-treat-fungal-infections-3264848.html?cat=68" target="_blank">A natural therapy site</a> gets it exactly wrong: &#8220;Continuing to consume yogurt . . . on a daily basis after the immediate problem has been solved may prevent future outbreaks&#8221;).</p>
<p>His food allergies started going away. Wheat was the worst. After eating wheat, he got brain fog, agitation (difficulty sitting still), and difficulty focusing. He would start having violent imagery; for example, his dreams will get quite violent. A laboratory test showed that he had astronomical levels of an immune response to gluten peptides. Another food allergy of his was dairy. It caused agitation, difficulty concentrating, and depression (in the sense that you feel like you want to kill yourself). Before he figured this out, there were times he consumed a quart of milk in a short period of time. Half an hour later, he got these three symptoms, including scary depression (“there’s no way out”). Now he can consume both wheat and dairy without trouble. His wheat allergy isn’t entirely gone but it is much better. He hasn&#8217;t noticed any allergic reaction to dairy, even large amounts.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d had blood sugar problems for a long time. He&#8217;d had hypoglycemia since his late twenties. After strenuous exercise, he could come close to passing out. He would eat fruit to keep this from happening. He’d be lying on the floor, drag himself to eat a piece of fruit, and instantly feel better. After a meal, he’d feel tired, then eat something sweet and feel a rush of energy. He had a regular need for sweet things, including dessert. Whenever he had dinner, he’d really want dessert. About eight months after he started alternate day fasting, he realized that his craving for something sweet went away. One day it was present, the next day gone. Instead of feeling tired after a big meal, he felt calm.</p>
<p>He thinks that he must have had a candida infection and his gut is healing. This would explain the allergies going away and the GERD improvement. He hadn’t expected these changes. He just started it because it fit his eating patterns and was more regular.</p>
<p>“I’ve experienced hunger for the first time,” he says. If he doesn’t eat the morning of a day he’s supposed to eat, he feels ravenously hungry – a new experience. A crystal-clear sense of hunger, which is pleasant. It&#8217;s pleasant to know what hunger is. He takes meals more seriously, because that’s the day he’s eating. He pays more attention to his food.</p>
<p>I found his experience far more convincing than anything else I&#8217;d heard about intermittent fasting. It was sustainable, it was easy, the benefits were unexpected, no ideology was involved, all sorts of things got better. It was as if this was the eating pattern our bodies were built for. My friend&#8217;s experience led me to try alternate day fasting, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/30/alternate-day-fasting-improved-my-blood-sugar/" target="_blank">as I&#8217;ve said</a>. After a few days my fasting blood sugar substantially improved (from the mid-90s to the mid-80s). Within weeks, my HbA1c went from 5.8 to 5.4. I haven&#8217;t noticed mental changes but my brain test scores have improved for reasons I cannot yet explain (there are several possible explanations).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent posts (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/07/the-rise-and-fall-of-heart-disease/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/18/sunlight-and-heart-disease/" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/28/heart-disease-epidemic-and-latitude-effect-reconciliation/" target="_blank">here</a>), I&#8217;ve described the ideas of David Grimes, a British doctor, about the cause of heart disease. Grimes recently responded to comments on <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/28/heart-disease-epidemic-and-latitude-effect-reconciliation/" target="_blank">the last post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, to develop the latitude theme, that distance from the equator determines risk of heart disease, cancers, multiple sclerosis and others. Four visual pieces of evidence for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Sunshine_Average_1971-2000_1-1.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10809" alt="Sunshine_Average_1971-2000_1 (1)" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Sunshine_Average_1971-2000_1-1-240x300.gif" width="240" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The sunshine map of the UK: We see what would also be the map of multiple sclerosis and CHD in the UK &#8212; both diseases most common in the west of scotland and least common in the south-east of England. Similar pattern of average life expectancy.</p>
<p>Look at cancer incidence in North America for another latitude effect.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PastedGraphic-3.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10809" alt="" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PastedGraphic-3.gif" width="500" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Then there is breast and colon cancer in Europe:</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PastedGraphic-4.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10809" alt="" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PastedGraphic-4.gif" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>But the [most] important observation of the sun being protective against cardiovascular disease comes from the USA. A latitude effect is present but weak. However a longitude effect is powerful. It works out as an altitude effect &#8212; the higher the altitude of residence the lower the risk of death from cardio-vascular disease (coronary heart disease + stroke). It is interesting to note the mirror image of the land profile from east to west and the CVD death profile. This can be explained most simply and most plausibly by the higher UV exposure at higher altitudes.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PastedGraphic-5.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10809" alt="" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PastedGraphic-5.gif" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PastedGraphic-6.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10809" alt="" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PastedGraphic-6.gif" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This is a powerful supplement to the latitude observations in Europe. The [north-south] length of Europe is worth remembering: the north of Scotland is the same latitude as Hudson Bay. In the north of England I live further north than anywhere in China. This means big sun exposure effects.</p></blockquote>
<p>The size of the disease differences is impressive &#8212; e.g., a factor of 2. I think these sunshine correlations are due either to a protective effect of Vitamin D or a protective effect of sleep (more sunshine = better sleep). There&#8217;s no doubt that sleep quality depends on the amplitude of a circadian rhythm (greater amplitude = better sleep), which in turn depends on the amplitude of the sunlight intensity rhythm, the day-night difference.</p>

<p>This graph shows my HbA1c values in recent years. After a lot of variation, they settled down to 5.8, which was the measurement a month ago. 5.8 isn&#8217;t terrible &#8212; below 6.0 is sometimes called &#8220;okay&#8221;) &#8212; but there is room for improvement. In <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0908359" target="_blank">a large 2010 study</a>, average HbA1c was 5.5. The study suggested that a HbA1c of about 5.0 was ideal.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago I started alternate-day fasting (= eating much less than usual every other day) for entirely different reasons. <span id="more-10789"></span>Although people sometimes find alternate-day fasting unpleasant (they get too hungry on the fast days), I haven&#8217;t noticed this. I blogged recently that within days of starting, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=10784" target="_blank">my fasting blood sugar levels greatly improved</a>. Yesterday I got my HbA1c measured again. It was 5.4 &#8212; much better. This supports the idea that alternate-day fasting is helping a lot. HbA1c measures glucose in the blood over 8-12 weeks so there could easily be more improvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether intermittent fasting can be used as a tool to prevent diabetes in those individuals at high risk or to prevent progression in those recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes remains a tantalizing notion,&#8221; <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Health-Wire/fasting-diabetes-heart-disease-cholesterol/2013/04/29/id/501911" target="_blank">said</a> an author of <a href="http://dvd.sagepub.com/content/13/2/68.long" target="_blank">a recent paper on the subject</a>. My experience suggests that you can easily find out for yourself if intermittent fasting will help. It took only a week to be sure that my fasting blood sugar had improved and only three weeks to have a good idea that my HbA1c has improved. My improvement was almost as fast and clear as what happens when people with a vitamin deficiency are given the vitamin they need.</p>
<p>There are countless ways of doing alternate-day fasting (or, more generally, intermittent fasting). A clinical trial usually tests just one way, which you may not want to copy exactly. My results suggest that blood sugar measurements provide an easy way to tell if your particular version of intermittent fasting is helping.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I gave a talk at a Quantified Self Meetup in San Francisco titled &#8220;Why is my blood sugar high?&#8221; (PowerPoint <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=10770" target="_blank">here</a> and <a "href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10760363/2013-06-26%20Why%20is%20My%20Blood%20Sugar%20High.pptx" target="_blank">here</a>). My main point was that alternate-day fasting (eating much less than usual every other day) quickly brought my fasting blood sugar level from the mid-90s to the low 80s, which is where I wanted it. I was unsure how to do this and had tried several things that hadn&#8217;t worked.</p>
<p>Not in the talk is an explanation of my results in terms of setpoint (blood sugar setpoint, not body fat setpoint). Your body tries to maintain a certain blood sugar level &#8212; that&#8217;s obvious. Not obvious at all is what controls the setpoint. This question is usually ignored &#8212; for example, in Wikipedia&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_regulation" target="_blank">blood sugar regulation</a> entry. Maybe Type 2 diabetes occurs because the blood sugar setpoint is too high. If we can find out what environmental events control the setpoint, we will be in a much better position to prevent and reverse Type 2 diabetes (as with obesity).</p>
<p>A few years ago, I discovered that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/" target="_blank">walking an hour per day improved my fasting blood sugar</a>. Does walking lower the setpoint? I didn&#8217;t ask this question, a curious omission from the author of <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>. If walking lowered the setpoint, walking every other day might have the same effect as walking every day.</p>
<p>I was pushed toward this line of thought because alternate-day fasting seems to lower the blood-sugar setpoint. After I started alternate-day fasting, it took about three days for my fasting blood sugar to reach a new lower level. After that, it was low every day, not just after fast days. My experience suggests that the blood-sugar setpoint depends on what your blood sugar is. When your blood sugar is high, the setpoint becomes higher; when your blood sugar is low, the setpoint becomes lower. Tim Lundeen had told me something similar to this.</p>
<p>If you tried to lower your fasting blood sugar and succeeded, I hope you will say in the comments how you did this. I tried three things that didn&#8217;t work: darker bedroom, Vitamin B supplement, and cinnamon. Eating low carb raises<strong> </strong>fasting blood sugar, <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2011/11/safe-starches-symposium-dr-ron-rosedale/" target="_blank">according to Paul Jaminet</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last half century, heart disease has been the most common cause of death in rich countries &#8212; more common than cancer, for example. I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/07/the-rise-and-fall-of-heart-disease/" target="_blank">recently discussed</a> the observation of David Grimes, a British gastroenterologist, that <a href="http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/105/6/509.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">heart disease has followed an infectious-disease epidemic-like pattern</a>: sharp rise, sharp fall. From 1920 to 1970, heart disease in England  increased by a factor of maybe 100; from a very low level to 500 deaths per 100,000 people per year. From 1970 to 2010, it has decreased by a factor of 10. This pattern cannot be explained by any popular idea about heart disease. For example, dietary or exercise or activity changes cannot explain it. They haven&#8217;t changed the right way (way up, way down) at the right time (peaking in 1970). In spite of this ignorance, I have never heard a health expert express doubt about what causes heart disease. This fits with what I learned when I studied myself. What I learned had little correlation with what experts said.</p>
<p>Before the epidemic paper, Grimes wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Cholesterol-The-Importance-Sun/dp/0956213200" target="_blank">a book about heart disease</a>. It stressed the importance of latitude: heart disease is more common at more extreme latitudes. For example, it is more common in Scotland than the south of England. The same correlation can be seen in many data sets and with other diseases, including influenza, variant Creuztfeldt-Jacob disease, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21478203" target="_blank">multiple sclerosis</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15480983" target="_blank">Crohn&#8217;s disease</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111031115105.htm" target="_blank">other digestive diseases</a>. More extreme latitudes get less sun. Grimes took the importance of latitude to suggest the importance of Vitamin D. Better sleep with more sun is another possible explanation.</p>
<p>The amount of sunlight has changed very little over the last hundred years so it cannot explain the epidemic-like rise and fall of heart disease. I asked Grimes how he reconciled the two sets of findings. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>It took twenty years for me to realize the importance of the sun. I always felt that diet was grossly exaggerated and that victim-blaming was politically and medically convenient &#8211; disease was due to the sufferers and it was really up to them to correct their delinquent life-styles. I was brought up and work in the north-west of England, close to Manchester. The population has the shortest life-expectancy in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland even worse. It must be a climate effect. And so on to sunlight. So many parallels from a variety of diseases.</p>
<p>When I wrote my book I was aware of the unexplained decline of CHD deaths and I suggested that the UK Clean Air Act of 1953 might have been the turning point, the effect being after 1970. Cleaning of the air did increase sun exposure but the decline of CHD deaths since 1970 has been so great that there must be more to it than clean air and more sun. At that time I was unaware of the rise of CHD deaths after 1924 and so I was unaware of the obvious epidemic. I now realize that CHD must have been due to an environmental factor, probably biological, and unidentified micro-organism. This is the cause, but the sun, through immune-enhancement, controls the distribution, geographical, social and ethnic. The same applies to many cancers, multiple sclerosis, Crohn&#8217;s disease (my main area of clinical activity), and several others. I think this reconciles the sun and a biological epidemic.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Cholesterol-The-Importance-Sun/dp/0956213200" target="_blank"><em>Vitamin D and Cholesterol: The Importance of the Sun</em></a> (2009) by David Grimes, a British doctor, contains more than a hundred graphs and tables. Most of the book is about heart disease.  Grimes argues that a great deal of heart disease is due to too little Vitamin D, usually due to too little sunlight. I recently blogged about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/06/07/the-rise-and-fall-of-heart-disease/" target="_blank">other work by Dr. Grimes</a> &#8212; about the rise and fall of heart disease.</p>
<p>Part of the book is about problems with the cholesterol hypothesis (high cholesterol causes heart disease).  One study found that in men aged 56-65, there was no relationship between death rate and cholesterol level over the next thirty years, during which almost all of them died (Figure 29.2). There <em>is</em> a positive correlation between death rate and cholesterol level for younger men (aged 31-39). The same pattern is seen with women, except that women 60 years or older show the &#8220;wrong&#8221; correlation: women in the <em>lowest</em> quartile of cholesterol level have by far the <em>highest</em> death rate (Figure 29.5). A female friend of mine in England, who is almost 60, was recently told by her doctor that her cholesterol is dangerously high.</p>
<p>The book was inspired by Grimes&#8217; discovery of a correlation between latitude and heart disease: People who lived further north had more heart disease. This association is clear in the UK, for example (Figure 32.4). Controlling for latitude, he found a correlation between hours of sunshine and heart disease rate (Table 32.3): Towns with more sunshine had less heart disease. No doubt you&#8217;ve heard that dietary fat causes heart disease. In the famous Seven Countries study, there was indeed a strong correlation between percent calories from fat and heart disease death rate (Figure 30.2). You haven&#8217;t heard that in the same study there was a strong correlation between latitude and dietary fat intake (Figure 30.8): People in the north ate more fat than people in the south. The fat-heart disease correlation in that study could easily be due to a connection between latitude and heart disease. The correlation between latitude and heart disease, on the other hand, persists when diet is controlled for.</p>
<p>Grimes convinced me that the latitude/sunshine correlation with heart disease reflects something important. It is large, appears in many different contexts, and has resisted explanation via confounds. Maybe sunshine reduces heart disease by increasing Vitamin D, as Grimes argues, or maybe by improving sleep &#8212; the more sunshine you get, the deeper (= better) your sleep. Sleep is enormously important in fighting off infection, and a variety of data suggest that heart disease has a microbial aspect. As long-time readers of this blog know, I take Vitamin D3 at a fixed time (8 am) every morning, thereby improving my Vitamin D status <strong>and</strong> <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/" target="_blank">improving my sleep</a>.</p>
<p>Grimes and his book illustrate <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/01/24/not-the-same-study-section-how-the-truth-comes-out/" target="_blank">my insider/outsider rule</a>: To make progress, you need to be close enough to the subject (enough of an insider) to have a good understanding but far enough away (enough of an outsider) to be able to speak the truth. As a doctor, Grimes is close to the study of disease etiology. However, he&#8217;s a gastroenterologist, not a cardiologist or epidemiologist. This allows him to say whatever he wants about the cause of heart disease. He won&#8217;t be punished for heretical ideas.</p>
