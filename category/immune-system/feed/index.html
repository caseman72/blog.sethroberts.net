				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When friends complain about evil government (e.g., NSA surveillance), I tell them &#8220;never underestimate the stupidity of government employees&#8221; &#8212; by which I mean their stupidity outweighs their self-interest. The Obamacare website fiasco is a good illustration. Everyone has heard &#8220;power corrupts&#8221; but closer to the truth is power makes you stupid.</p>
<p>The Obama website fiasco had many precursors. One was in the 1950s &#8212; in the details of <a href="http://www.whale.to/v/eddy.html" target="_blank">the introduction of the polio vaccine</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather than staging a long series of careful field trials with appropriate scientific evaluation, Salk darted ahead on his own in the remainder of 1953 and 1954. The trials were successful. The foundation released the results to the press, and such were the nation’s expectations that from that point there was no turning back. In August 1954 the foundation ordered five drug companies to begin producing mass lots of vaccine, on the basis of a formula for inactivating the virus with formaldehyde, according to a procedure Salk himself had devised. . . . James Shannon remembered very well what happened next. At this point he had become the associate director of the NIH.  “I was working over the weekend and I got a telephone call from Los Angeles, and this is eight or nine o’clock on Friday night. It was the Health officer of the City of Los Angeles and he said they just had two reports of polio in some children who had been vaccinated nine days earlier. He wanted to know what should be done about it?”</p>
<p>One of the companies that contracted to make the vaccine, the Cutter Laboratories in Berkeley, California, had released several lots of vaccine that had been improperly inactivated. Live polio virus was being injected into children. The gratitude of the public turned to horror, as the cutter vaccine gave polio to almost 80 recipients; these children in turn went on to spread the disease to another 120 playmates and relatives; three quarters of the victims were paralysed and 11 died. . . . NIH&#8217;s Laboratory of Biologics Control, which had certified the Salk vaccine, had received advance warning of problems. . . .</p>
<p>In 1954 the rush was on. [Eddy's] lab had gotten samples of the inactivated polio vaccine to certify on a &#8220;due-yesterday&#8221; basis. &#8220;This was a product that had never been made before and they were going to use it right away,” she recalled. She and her staff worked around the clock. &#8220;We had eighteen monkeys. We inoculated these eighteen monkeys with each vaccine that came in. And we started getting paralyzed monkeys.&#8221; She reported to her superiors that the lots were Cutter&#8217;s, and sent pictures of the paralyzed monkeys along as well. &#8220;They were going to be injecting this thing into children. . . .They went ahead and released the vaccine anyway, a lot of it. The monkeys they just disregarded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shannon called the Surgeon General Satur­day morning. Additional cases of paralysis continued to occur. &#8220;It seemed obvious that we had a crisis on our hands, the magnitude of which was unknown.&#8221; Late Saturday afternoon a working group of senior virus specialists, whose advice the polio foundation had started to ignore a year earlier, began meeting in Shannon&#8217;s office. Note that Shannon had completely taken charge of the crisis. &#8220;Sebrell was not the man to manage this,&#8221; DeWitt Stetten recalled. &#8216;James Shannon was a man of quite different character.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shannon had brought in the Surgeon General, who called polio chief Basil O&#8217;Connor in New York. On Monday evening O&#8217;Connor and his advisers came down to Bethesda. Shannon wanted to withdraw the vaccine, &#8220;It was a very stormy meeting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;O&#8217;Connor and the polio group in general disallowed any possibility of induced infections [as a result of the vaccine]. &#8230; So Basil O&#8217;Connor stormed out with dire warning of what he was going to do to the NIH and the Public Health Service. Further vaccination was stopped. I had many sleepless nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The basic problem had really not been the carelessness of the Cutter company, which rightly or wrongly was exonerated in a later report. It was the difficulty in jumping from Salk&#8217;s lab experiments with killing (formalinizing) the virus to large-scale industrial production.</p>
<p>. . . Ruth Kirschstein, the director today of an important NIH institute, added, &#8220;The Cutter incident resulted in everybody up the line who had anything to do with it—very few people know this story—being dismissed because of it.&#8221; All went out: the director of the microbiology institute lost his post, as did the equivalent of the assistant secretary for health. Oveta Culp Hobby, the secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (or Oveta &#8220;Culpable&#8221; Hobby, as she was known), stepped down. Dr. Sebrell, the director of the NIH, resigned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whereas I think the &#8220;basic problem&#8221; was overestimating the competence of powerful people, especially powerful experts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As recently as four or five years ago,and for many years before that, I often had a runny nose. I went through boxes and boxes of Kleenex. I carried a handkerchief everywhere and often used it. Not because I had a cold&#8211;I almost never got colds. It was different than that. You might say I was mildly allergic to something in the air.<span id="more-7887"></span></p>
<p>Because of reading an article I will discuss in a moment, I have just noticed that my runny nose has vanished, both in Berkeley (clean air) and Beijing (dirty air).  So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s due to the dirty air in Beijing. There was no sharp change but as best I can remember it went away during the period when I started eating lots of fermented foods. Most days I eat about three types &#8212; yogurt and two other things, such as kimchi or kombucha. It is plausible that more exposure to bacteria caused my immune system to stop overreacting.</p>
<p><a href="http://sm.labx.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTkxMyZtZXNzYWdlaWQ9NTI3JmRhdGFiYXNlaWQ9ODAwJnNlcmlhbD0xNjc3NzgyOCZlbWFpbGlkPXR3b3V0b3BpYXNAZ21haWwuY29tJnVzZXJpZD0xXzg2NTYwJnRhcmdldGlkPSZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;2022&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/32602/title/Bacterial-Sentinels-of-Noses/" target="_blank">The article</a>, from <em>The Scientist</em>, describes research suggesting that <strong>not enough</strong> bacteria can cause disease &#8212; specifically, sinusitis. Sinusitis, just like ulcers, has been associated with a particular bacterium, but the researcher involved, Susan Lynch of UCSF, has a more sophisticated understanding of causality than those two bacteria-causes-ulcers scientists and the committee that gave them a Nobel Prize. Lynch points out, quite reasonably, that the bacteria associated with sinusitis &#8220;have also been detected in the sinuses of healthy individuals . . . “Just because you find these organisms, it does not mean they are driving disease.” (The bacterium that supposedly caused ulcers, <em>C. pylori</em>, turned out to be very common. Almost everyone infected did not have ulcers.)</p>
<p>Lynch and her colleagues discovered</p>
<blockquote><p>Samples from [sinusitis] patients tended to have less diversity of bacterial species than those of healthy controls. Furthermore the relative abundance of certain species differed between patients and controls. Sinusitis patients’s noses were enriched with a skin bacteria called <em>Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum</em>, for example, while samples from healthy controls were enriched with <em>Lactobacillus </em>bacteria, including <em>L. sakei. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Which you could obviously get from fermented food. Following up this observation, the researchers did a mouse study that found that giving mice the bad bacteria caused sinusitis-like symptoms but giving mice both bad bacteria and good bacteria did not cause the symptoms. The good bacteria were protective.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anne Weiss recently repointed me to <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-epidemiologist-tom-jefferson-a-whole-industry-is-waiting-for-a-pandemic-a-637119.html">an interview with the epidemiologist Tom Jefferson</a> about swine flu. Jefferson, let me stress, is a <strong>good</strong> epidemiologist. In the interview he makes a point I make on this blog, that research is heavily shaped by two questions: 1. what will make money? 2. what will be good for my career? (How curious that economists &#8212; with the exception of Veblen and Robin Hanson &#8212; spend so much more time on #1 than #2.) For example:<span id="more-7856"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Interviewer</strong> Why aren&#8217;t researchers interested in [other viruses]?</p>
<p><strong>Jefferson:</strong> It&#8217;s easy: They can&#8217;t make money with [them]. With rhinoviruses, RSV and the majority of the other viruses, it&#8217;s hard to make a lot of money or a career out of it. Against influenza, though, there are vaccines, and there are drugs you can sell. And that&#8217;s where the big money from the pharmaceuticals industry is. It makes sure that research on influenza is published in the good journals. And that&#8217;s why you have more attention being paid there, and the entire research field becomes interesting for ambitious scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because Jefferson is willing to tell the truth about virology, it is interesting what he doesn&#8217;t say.</p>
<p>The big glaring gap is that in a discussion about how to avoid getting sick he says nothing about improving immune function. Not one word. He isn&#8217;t a doctor. He doesn&#8217;t work for a drug company. There is no obvious reason he fails to discuss this. He is reflecting the blindness of his whole field, I believe. It isn&#8217;t a mystery how to improve immune function: Sleep better and eat more fermented food. I have blogged before (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/06/05/what-to-do-about-antibiotic-resistance-improve-immune-function/">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/06/11/more-examples-of-mainstream-health-care-ignoring-the-immune-system/">here</a>, and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/12/23/more-neglect-of-the-immune-system-bioterrorism-fear/">here</a>, for example) about how widely this supremely important question &#8212; how to improve immune function &#8212; is ignored.</p>
<p>The other gap in the interview is more subtle. Jefferson recommends hand-washing as a great way to avoid getting sick. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wash my hands very often &#8212; and it&#8217;s not all because of swine flu. That&#8217;s probably the most effective precaution there is against all respiratory viruses, and the majority of gastrointestinal viruses and germs as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>One study done in Pakistan has shown that hand washing can even save children&#8217;s lives. Someone should get a Nobel Prize for that!</p></blockquote>
<p>In contrast, I believe that touching other people (and thereby picking up their germs on your hands) is part of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/10/why-we-touch-our-mouths-so-often-forewarned-is-forearmed/">a self-vaccination system whose goal is to protect us against the dangerous microbes nearby by exposing us to them in small amounts.</a> Part of the system is an enjoyment of touching others and being touched. Another part is whatever causes us to constantly touch ourselves around the mouth. A third part is the tonsils, perfectly placed to pick up a tiny fraction of the germs around our mouths.</p>
<p>This theory of mine, which is supported by several lines of evidence, suggests that hand washing has a serious downside: It interferes with the self-vaccination system. Jefferson says nothing about any downside of hand washing. I&#8217;m not saying that Jefferson should have known of this theory of mine, of course not. (For one thing, the interview was before I thought of it.) My point is that &#8212; for reasons having nothing to do with money or career &#8212; he is too certain about what he knows. Maybe hand washing is only helpful when persons have weak immune systems or in places with large amounts of germs, such as hospitals. With strong immune systems in normal places, maybe it does more harm than good.</p>
<p>I became aware of the big gap in research after <a href="http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I improved my sleep and stopped getting colds</a>. Before that, I had gotten the usual number of colds. No one had said that could happen &#8212; had said there was so much room for improvement in immune function. Anne Weiss became aware of the gap in research when she visited her doctor:</p>
<blockquote><p>[More than 10] years ago I was seeing a family medicine doc who also taught epidemiology at [Famous Canadian University]. At one of my appointments I asked her how I could strengthen my immune system. She laughed in my face and told me that just was not possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Weiss says she was treated &#8220;as if I had asked about the existence of fairies or unicorns.&#8221; (She added that attitudes seem to be changing and one Canadian hospital now uses probiotics to prevent and treat <em>C. difficile</em> infection.)</p>
<p>Epidemiologists could easily study environmental control of immune function. They could ask questions like <em>how many colds do you get in a typical year?</em>, <em>when you get a cold, how long does it usually take before the symptoms disappear?</em> and <em>during the last year, how many days did your longest cold last?</em> As far as I know, they haven&#8217;t done so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/10/why-we-touch-our-mouths-so-often-forewarned-is-forearmed/">I have proposed</a> that three things &#8212; a tendency to touch each other (e.g., shake hands), a tendency to touch near our mouths, and our tonsils &#8212; together form an early warning system for our immune system. The early warning system helps the immune system get tiny exposure to microbes circulating in the community. It performs self-vaccination. Like ordinary vaccination, exposure to tiny amounts of Microbe X protects against exposure to a large amount of Microbe X.</p>
<p>In Daniel Everett&#8217;s anthropological study of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_people">Pirahã people</a> (<em>Don&#8217;t Sleep, There are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle</em>, 2009) he says the Pirahã &#8220;all touch one another frequently&#8221; (p. 85). &#8220;They loved to touch me too.&#8221; He has never seen kissing but &#8220;there is a word for it, so they must do it.&#8221; This supports the idea that a tendency to touch others is widespread.</p>
<p>If this theory is true, reducing microbe exposure to zero (e.g., sterile food) is a seriously bad thing. It&#8217;s been proposed that the polio epidemics of the first half of the 1900s were caused by cities becoming too clean.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/06/05/what-to-do-about-antibiotic-resistance-improve-immune-function/">a recent post</a> I made an obvious point. If our immune systems were stronger, we would need antibiotics less often and antibiotic resistance would become less of a problem. I hadn&#8217;t heard this point made (for example, <a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2012/9789241503181_eng.pdf">this WHO report</a> fails to say it). This was one example, I said, of how mainstream health care ignores the immune system. Perfectly obvious things, such as this idea about antibiotic resistance, fail to be noticed. I gave five more examples. Since then I have come across even more examples:</p>
<p>1. Hospitals do little to help patients sleep and often interrupt sleep, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/06/05/what-to-do-about-antibiotic-resistance-improve-immune-function/#comment-969914">Nancy Lebovitz pointed out</a> (better sleep &#8211;&gt; better immune function). <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/need-sleep-stay-out-of-the-hospital/">This article</a> describes the problem. One way to improve hospital sleep &#8212; beyond <strong>don&#8217;t wake patients up</strong> &#8212; would be to provide exposure to strong sunlight-like light in the morning and prevent exposure to sunlight-like light after dark. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I found that an hour of sunlight or similar light from fluorescent lamps in the morning improved my sleep</a>. Most fluorescent light resembles sunlight (both have strong bluish components), incandescent light (reddish) does not. Until they install dual lighting systems (bluish light during the day, reddish light at night), hospitals can provide blue-blocker glasses to wear after dark.</p>
<p>2. The book <a href="http://immortalbirdpostscript.wordpress.com/"><em>Immortal Bird</em></a> (sent me by the publisher) tells how Damon Weber, born with a defective heart, had a heart transplant when he was a teenager. After the transplant, problems arose. The doctors involved (at <a href="http://nyp.org/">NewYork-Presbyterian ­Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center</a>) took the problems to be signs of transplant rejection. In fact they were due to infection. Drugs given to deal with the mistakenly-assumed rejection suppressed Damon&#8217;s immune system. They reduced his ability to fight off the infection and he died. The author of the book, Damon&#8217;s father, sued the doctors and hospital for malpractice. The doctors did not exactly &#8220;ignore&#8221; the immune system, but they apparently failed to fully grasp the danger of immune suppression, even though the infection that killed Damon is common in transplant cases. (Although Columbia Presbyterian charged half a million dollars for the transplant, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/books/review/immortal-bird-doron-webers-lament-for-his-son.html?pagewanted=all">&#8220;three years into the lawsuit the [hospital's] medical director claimed Damon’s post-op records couldn’t be located</a>.&#8221;)</p>
<p>3. I asked a UCSF medical student what she&#8217;d been taught about the immune system. &#8220;We cover it!&#8221; she said. In a section called &#8220;Infectious Disease, Immunology, and Inflammation&#8221;. <em>What makes the immune system work better or worse</em>? I asked. &#8220;If you&#8217;re stressed out, it doesn&#8217;t work well,&#8221; she said. If you&#8217;re malnourished, like in Bangladesh. You need &#8220;nutrients and vitamins&#8221;. (A booklet I got telling me to take less antibiotics told me to &#8220;eat healthy&#8221;.) She also said the students get entire lectures on how to treat diseases so rare they might never be encountered. There is a whole section on genetics. Sure, they cover it. So superficially that they don&#8217;t remember the most basic idea: Better sleep &#8211;&gt; better immune function. I said our health care system is built around <strong>first, let them get sick</strong>. That&#8217;s right, she said. Ignoring the immune system is an excellent way to allow people to get sick.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://huntgatherlove.com/">Melissa McEwen</a> pointed out that proton pump inhibitors, such as Nexium, reduce the body&#8217;s ability to fight infection. They are prescribed for acid reflux and reduce how much acid the stomach makes. Because stomach acid kills bacteria, there should have been far more concern about their safety. &#8220;Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide [billions of prescriptions]. . . . The collective body of information overwhelmingly suggests an increased risk of infectious complications,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19786155">this article</a>. Because the drugs are so common, the damage is great and, because of more infection, not restricted to those who take them. It could have been avoided by research into treatments that do not harm the immune system.</p>
