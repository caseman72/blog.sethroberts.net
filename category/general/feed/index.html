				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, this is Seth’s mother Justine. I’d like to offer what little information I have to try to answer some of the questions that were posted about Seth’s death. We’re told that we’ll get a full coroner’s report in about 6 months. In the meantime we were given only “Cause A: Occlusive coronary artery disease” and “Other significant conditions: cardiomegaly.”</p>
<p>Most of you won’t be surprised to learn that Seth had not visited his doctor in Berkeley in many years, and, responding to a recent question, said that he hadn’t been to a doctor during his stay in Beijing either. We are left with 3 sets of paper records. The earliest, dated 2009, reports a Coronary Calcium (Agatston score) screening which he discussed <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/25/saturated-fat-and-heart-attacks/" target="new">here</a> last October. He obtained a second screening 1-1/2 year later. The first report showed his coronary artery occlusion to be about average for a man his age, with an accompanying risk of heart attack, but no cardiomegaly. The second report, following his conclusion that butter was beneficial for him, and his heavy ingestion of it, showed an improvement in his score: “Most people get about 25% worse each year. My second scan showed regression (= improvement). It was 40% better (less) than expected (a 25% increase).” The report showed the calcification to be unevenly distributed, with most found in his left main coronary artery, and none in all but one of the other arteries. Again, no heart enlargement was reported.</p>
<p>The second medical report set, done in December 2011, was from Beijing and covered an exam that may have been required by his employer, Tsinghua University. This included a physical exam, an x-ray and EKG. All reports were negative, i.e., no abnormal findings and no cardiomegaly.</p>
<p>The third set of reports, from a laboratory in St. Charles, Ill., used data collected in Berkeley. They list toxic and essential elements in his hair. The latest report, dated July 18, 2013, showed one element rated “high.” This was mercury, “found to correlate with a 9% increase in AMI [acute myocardial infarction]” according to the report. His level was assumed to indicate exposure gained from eating fish. Presumably Beijing’s toxic smog contributed directly both to the mercury level of the fish that he ate there, and to the level in his hair.</p>
<p>The only information about his blood pressure was in the Beijing report where it was recorded at 117/87. I could find no information about cholesterol levels, though it has not been a familial problem. Of the remaining Framingham Study risk factors: Seth did not smoke or have diabetes. He was not overweight and was physically active. Seth’s father died of a heart attack at 72.</p>
<p>Of course, I can’t end this posting without sending my deepest thanks for all of the kind notes posted here. They were hurtful to read because of the reminding. They were healing to read because of the solace gained from learning about his friends and that he was able to help many people.</p>
<p>-<em>Justine</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a long time, researchers have found links between high sodium intake and higher blood pressure, and between higher blood pressure and increased risk of stroke. At the same time, critics, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/opinion/sunday/we-only-think-we-know-the-truth-about-salt.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">including Gary Taubes</a>, have argued that the data do not support the idea that most people should reduce their salt intake.<span id="more-13510"></span></p>
<p>New evidence suggests the critics were wrong. Four different studies support the idea that high amounts of salt intake are generally bad.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/4/e004549.full" target="_blank">One study</a> recently appeared in <em>BMJ Open</em>.  &#8221;The UK initiated a nationwide salt reduction programme in 2003/2004. The programme has been successful and resulted in a 15% reduction in population salt intake by 2011,&#8221; write the authors. That might not seem like much but the reduction was in the salt in processed foods, which for most people is most of their salt intake. The more processed food you ate &#8212; and the more extreme your salt intake &#8212; the greater the reduction.</p>
<p>The main finding of the study was that over the same period, there was a large and steady decrease in both blood pressure and strokes in the UK. Mortality from stroke and ischemic heart disease (IHD) went down by 40%!</p>
<p>There were small changes in other environmental variables over the same period: people ate slightly more fruit and vegetables, weighed slightly more, smoked somewhat less, and so on. Maybe these other changes were what led one critic to dismiss the results in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/health/study-linking-illness-and-salt-leaves-researchers-doubtful.html" target="_blank">a <i>New York Times</i> article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Niels Graudal, a senior consultant in the department of internal medicine at Copenhagen University Hospital, said that connecting the two events “is meaningless.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This paper describes two independent incidents,” he added. “That these incidents should be in any way connected is absolutely unlikely.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Consistent with the low quality of science journalism in the <i>New York Times</i>, it seems the reporter, Nicholas Balakar, did not ask Dr. Graudel any hard questions &#8212; for example, for an alternative explanation of the decline.</p>
<p>The BMJ study did a poor job of determining the <i>a priori</i> likelihood of such a big decline. It could have looked at year by year changes in stroke and IHD mortality before 2003, for example. Was stroke and IHD mortality rising or falling? It could have looked at changes in stroke and IHD mortality in similar countries without a salt reduction program over the same period. Such comparisons would have helped a lot. But the BMJ study did report the results of other nationwide salt reduction programs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Japan, in the late 1960s, carried out a government-led campaign to reduce salt intake. Over the following decade, salt intake was reduced, particularly in northern areas from 18 to 14 g/day. Paralleling this reduction in salt intake, there were falls in BP and an 80% reduction in stroke mortality in spite of large increases in fat intake, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity which occurred during that period. Finland, in the late 1970s, initiated a systematic approach to reducing salt intake through mass media-campaigns, co-operation with the food industry and implementing salt labelling legislation. This led to a significant reduction in the average salt intake of the Finnish population from ≈14 g/day in 1972 to less than 9 g/day in 2002. The reduction in salt intake was accompanied by a fall of over 10 mm Hg in systolic and diastolic BP and a decrease of 75–80% in stroke and IHD mortality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, reductions in salt intake happened just before huge decreases in stroke and IHD mortality. It is the triple repetition of an unlikely event (big reductions in mortality) and the experimental aspect (something was specifically changed) that convince me. The critics are not going to come up with a plausible alternative explanation of all three cases (UK, Japan, Finland) any time soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/03/26/ajh.hpu028.1.full" target="_blank">A paper</a> co-authored by the same Dr. Graudal who dismissed the new findings found that high sodium intake was associated with increased mortality. It also found that low sodium intake was associated with increased mortality. This is why a reduction in the salt in processed food makes so much sense: 1. It&#8217;s easy. You don&#8217;t have to do anything. 2. It reduces salt intake the most in people who eat the most salt &#8212; exactly where it is likely to be the most beneficial.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, this data also says that if you don&#8217;t eat a lot of salt, there is no good reason to reduce your salt intake (unless you have high blood pressure).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the headline of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/dawning-age-genomic-medicine-finally-213006405--finance.html;_ylt=AwrBEiJE6hhTvjAAKkDQtDMD" target="_blank">a Yahoo News article</a>, &#8220;the dawning of the age of genomic medicine&#8221; is upon us. There has been little impact of genomics but &#8220;that is finally changing,&#8221; says Julie Steenhuysen, the author of the article.</p>
<p>I was curious how this would be argued. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sambrookes had been very athletic as a young teen, but as she matured, she noticed a heaviness in her legs. By age 20, running left her tired. At 40, she needed a pacemaker, just like her mother did at that age.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started thinking there is something to this,&#8221; said Sambrookes, now 56, who lives in Michigan City, Indiana.</p>
<p>After some dead ends, she found McNally, who cast a wide net, testing for more than two dozen genes that could account for Sambrookes&#8217; heart and muscle problems.</p>
<p>The culprit turned out to be a mutation in a gene called Lamin that causes Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The disease can cause weakness and wasting of the muscles between the shoulders and knees. The mutation can also cause electrical disturbances of the heart.</p>
<p>McNally recommended Sambrookes replace her pacemaker with an implantable cardiac defibrillator that could protect against sudden cardiac death.</p>
<p>That proved to be the right call. Last August, Sambrookes&#8217; heart stopped three times. Each time, the defibrillator shocked her back to life.</p>
<p>&#8220;She literally tried to die three times,&#8221; McNally recalls of her patient. &#8220;It still takes my breath away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Because someone recommended a pacemaker be replaced with a defibrillator, genomic medicine is a good idea. The benefits of genomic medicine must remain elusive if you have to use such a poor example to support it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g1403" target="_blank">A recent study in the BMJ</a> concluded that the massive breast cancer &#8220;prevention&#8221; program &#8212; having women get annual mammograms &#8212; had done more harm than good. Women were randomly assigned to get mammograms plus self-exam or self-exam alone. The death rate from breast cancer was the same in the two groups. However, women in the mammogram group were told they had cancer and received very painful and expensive treatment far more often than women in the other group. This being modern medicine, the true situation is even <i>worse</i> than what you read in any article about the (very negative) study. One critic has said that the randomization was not done properly. If true, this means that medical researchers, even when told exactly what to do, don&#8217;t do it, in ways that make a multi-million dollar study useless. In spite of billions of dollars and billions of hours spent on mammograms and billions of pink ribbons, we still know practically nothing about the environmental causes of breast cancer. (I suspect bad sleep is a major cause. <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/262864.php" target="_blank">Shift work is associated with breast cancer</a>.)</p>
<p>A new book (to be published in March), titled <em>The Great Prostate Hoax: How the PSA Test was Hijacked by Big Medicine and Caused a Public Health Disaster</em> says that prostate cancer screening is no better. The book is by Richard Ablin, who discovered the prostate-specific protein used in the screening test. The trouble with the PSA test is simple. First, the reading is often high for reasons that have nothing to do with cancer. Second, prostate cancer is common (cancer increases as the fourth power of age) and usually benign.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129564.400-prostate-cancer-test-has-been-misused-for-money.html" target="_blank">an interview</a>, Ablin made some good points:</p>
<blockquote><p> The US Food and Drug Administration failed in its duty to the public: its advisers warned that routine PSA screening would cause a public health disaster, but it was approved under pressure from advocacy groups and drug companies. . . . The unfortunate reality is that no current data show that men who undergo PSA screening live longer than men who decide against it.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few years ago Ablin wrote <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/opinion/10Ablin.html" target="_blank">an op-ed</a> about this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I finished <i>The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty</i> by Nina Munk, I thought of something a graduate student in English had told me: <em>A little Derrida goes a long way and a lot of Derrida goes a little way</em>. It was literally true. A few sentences by Derrida, you could think about for days, maybe productively. A whole book by him was baffling and irritating. <em>A lot of Jeffrey Sachs goes a little way</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>When it came out (2005), I thought <i>The End of Poverty</i> by Sachs was the ravings of a lunatic. Munk&#8217;s book shows I was right but I had to admit that George Soros giving Sachs $100 million or whatever to put his ideas into practice (to &#8220;test&#8221; them) was considerably more interesting than the activities of the other billionaires Munk had written about before Sachs. Soros had an advisory board whose reaction to Sachs&#8217;s ideas was the same as mine but Soros overruled them. Soros was right. A tiny bit was learned from spending all that money, which is better than learning nothing. Certainly I learned more than if the money had been used to buy a private jet.</p>
<p>As an assistant professor doing animal learning experiments, I saw over and over that it was incredibly hard to learn anything. Anything. No doubt all science professors who are honest learn this. But then I saw something that is less easy to see: If doing the &#8220;right&#8221; thing pays off worse than we expect &#8212; Sachs&#8217;s flamboyant failure in Africa is an example &#8212; then <strong>doing the &#8220;wrong&#8221; thing should pay off better</strong>. If spending an enormous amount of money we learn less than expected, then when we spend very little money we should learn more than expected. This is the upside of ignorance. The less you know, the easier it is to learn more. And we know much less than famous professors, such as Sachs, say we know.</p>
<p>My personal science is the polar opposite of what Sachs did. He tried to help others (poor Africans), I try to help myself. He tries to help people he knows almost nothing about, I try to help myself &#8212; and I know a lot about myself. He tried to do something big (end poverty). I try to do something small (e.g., sleep better). What he did cost millions of dollars. What I do costs nothing. I can test a new idea about how to sleep better in days. Sachs took years to test his ideas. For me, failure costs almost nothing. Sachs&#8217;s failure cost him years of his life. You have to be an extraordinary person with great talent to do what Sachs did. Whereas anyone can do personal science.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the blog <a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mr. Heisenbug</a> (&#8220;Respect the microbiota&#8221;) is quite new, I have learned a lot from it, especially about the importance of fiber. I interviewed the blogger:</p>
<div><strong>SETH</strong> Tell me about yourself, such as your background relevant to your blog.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p><strong>HEISENBUG</strong>  My name is Shant Mesrobian. My professional/academic background has no relation to the content of the blog. My background is in tech/politics/publishing. The blog is just a side hobby and is produced from independent research. (I&#8217;m a &#8220;non-expert&#8221; as you might call it.)<span id="more-12792"></span></p>
<p><strong>SETH</strong> When did you start your blog? What led you to start it? Have you blogged before?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>HEISENBUG</strong> I started the blog about a month ago. I have not blogged before. I started it because the topic interests and excites me a lot. I anticipated a surge in microbiome experimentation and &#8220;hacking&#8221; and felt I could help direct that conversation in a productive direction. In digging through the research, there seemed to be a lot of dots that needed connecting.</p>
<p><strong>SETH </strong>What do you mean, &#8220;dots that needed connecting&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>HEISENBUG</strong>  Certain clusters of bacteria, and certain mechanisms (butyrate production, endotoxemia) kept surfacing in the studies I came across. For instance in the smoking post, it was sort of staring at you in the face that smoking clearly reduces levels of bacterial groups that are implicated in health and disease. Yet the study didn&#8217;t seem to find that interesting, so there was a gap that needed to be filled. But the pattern could only be detected by someone who reads a bunch of disparate studies. Same with the obesity/transplant study &#8212; many people are trying to help themselves because they vaguely know that potato starch can elevate butyrate (perhaps not even that much) &#8212; so here is a study showing directly that a different microbiota can achieve that, and it is particularly by elevating levels of bacteria that I had previously implicated as being prime starch degraders + butyrate producers. It&#8217;s been a series of eerie coincidences that has kept me posting material.</p>
<p>In general, I think there is a bit of an information gap about how to alter gut biota &#8212; there isn&#8217;t a real understanding of what &#8220;fiber&#8221; is.</p>
<p><strong>SETH</strong> What do people fail to understand about fiber?</p>
<p><strong>HEISENBUG</strong> First, that <em>fiber</em> is an overly broad and useless term. The only definition you can assign to the term is &#8220;a food that, when consumed, is not digested and is transported directly to the large intestine.&#8221; But what happens to the fiber when it gets there is completely dependent on what type of fiber it is. The type of fiber most people are familiar with is the mechanical kind that is just a bulking agent. Insoluble. No fermentation or microbial impact. Comes out the other end. The fibers we&#8217;re interested in are the bioactive type that are not only fermentable by gut bacteria, but preferentially fermented by good, commensal bacteria. But this isn&#8217;t what people think of when they hear &#8220;fiber.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other thing that&#8217;s not understood is that fiber can make a significant impact on the microbiome. People are just very primed by the germ theory aspect of bacteria &#8212; that they&#8217;re &#8220;bugs&#8221; you have to &#8220;catch.&#8221; So while people have begun to accept the idea that there are good bacteria that you want, the understanding is still very stuck in the &#8220;you have to eat the bacteria to get good bacteria.&#8221; I&#8217;m a big fan of fermented foods (making &amp; eating), but I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s the primary way to tend to one&#8217;s microbiome.</p>
<p><strong>SETH</strong> How have your ideas/beliefs about fiber changed over the years?</p>
<p><strong>HEISENBUG</strong> I currently consume a paleo/ancestral type of diet. Before then, I regarded fiber as most people do: a necessary, functional component of food that you need in order to &#8220;stay regular&#8221;. I sought it out mostly from whole grain foods. I did not realize there were different types of fiber, or that they had anything to do with gut flora.</p>
<p>Then, when I went paleo, I adopted the general paleo attitude toward fiber: fiber comes from grains and grains are bad, that fiber is an unnecessary bandage that covers up for a bad diet, and that good digestive health can be had by simply eating nutritionally dense, non-toxic foods that people are evolved to eat. Fermented/probiotic food being a helpful addition.</p>
<p>Then I came to my current position once I learned more about the microbiome. What I&#8217;ve realized is that while paleo/ancestral eating goes a long way toward correcting the modern standard American diet, it still retains one common feature with it (at least in the way most people seem to practice it), which is that it focuses primarily on feeding the upper GI, while starving the lower GI (ie, your large intestinal microbiota).</p>
<p>And the ironic twist is that by dropping wheat, paleo may in fact have LESS fermentable fiber than the standard American diet. That&#8217;s because, while it contains mostly insoluble fiber, wheat does contain a small amount of fermentable fiber, which means that wheat constitutes the primary source of fermentable prebiotic fiber for the average American. So drop wheat, and you probably just lost your predominant source of fermentable fiber for your gut flora.</p>
<p><strong>SETH</strong> The most interesting idea I&#8217;ve seen on your blog is that <a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/is-this-why-smoking-is-the-number-one-predictor-of-heart-disease/" target="_blank">smoking is associated with heart disease</a> (and other diseases) because it reduces microbial diversity. Because of this idea, I&#8217;ve become a lot more interested in fiber. Is this your idea? As you say, because smoking is such a big risk factor, it is a good place to start to understand heart disease (and other diseases). What are other explanations of why smoking is such a big risk factor?</p>
<p><strong>HEISENBUG</strong> I&#8217;ve never seen anyone else make the connection between smoking -&gt; microbial diversity -&gt; heart disease. Smoking&#8217;s high (#1) correlation has always intrigued me, especially since there have never been solid explanations for it. Separately, I&#8217;ve been reading about endotoxemia-induced inflammation and its effect on chronic metabolic disease. So when I came upon this study, it was sort of a smoking gun.</p>
<p>As I said, the explanations for smoking being a big risk factor, if you really read them, aren&#8217;t saying anything. They are generalities. &#8220;Smoking contributes to heart disease because it contributes to atherosclerosis.&#8221; Well of course. Atherosclerosis IS heart disease. The question is how? Smoking raises LDL cholesterol. Ok, but how?</p>
<p>The inflammatory cascade that results from loss of microbial diversity, a bloom in &#8220;bad&#8221; bacteria, and a decrease in &#8220;good&#8221; bacteria, is an explanation for all of those.</p>
<p><strong>SETH</strong> Could the importance of fiber explain <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199404143301501" target="_blank">that famous failed beta-carotene trial</a>? There had been plenty of correlations between beta-carotene and better health. Yet in an experiment, people taking beta-carotene if anything did worse than the control group. Maybe beta-carotene consumption was a marker for fiber (e.g., people who ate more beta-carotene ate more carrots).</p>
<p><strong>HEISENBUG </strong>If the epidemiology that inspired the trial was based on high carrot consumption, then I think that&#8217;s definitely a possibility &#8212; carrots are fairly high in pectin, a type of fiber with decent prebiotic activity. But since the trial subjects did even worse than placebo, I find another explanation convincing &#8212; that unusually high doses of beta-carotene, which is a precursor to vitamin A, blocks actual Vitamin A.</p>
<p><strong>SETH</strong> Has your better understanding of fiber improved your own health?</p>
<p><strong>HEISENBUG</strong> My health is already pretty good, and I think I&#8217;m probably too young for metabolic and chronic disease symptoms to make themselves evident, so I &#8220;unfortunately&#8221; can&#8217;t report on those types of markers. So for me this is all preventative at the moment. And I have yet to experiment with some more potent, high-dose prebiotic sources. I plan to soon. But I have noticed a significant improvement in sleep and a next-day feeling of well-being, relaxation, and clarity after a day when my fiber intake is higher and I consume yogurt cultured with lactobacillus and bifidobacteria, and I suspect it has something specifically to do with the bifidobacteria. That&#8217;s just a hypothesis now and something I&#8217;m currently exploring on the blog. Figuring out the ideal sourcing, combination, and amount of fiber is really still a work in progress as far as I&#8217;m concerned. There&#8217;s no real handbook, and people are just starting to figure all of this out. Lots of people experimenting with resistant starch (in the form of potato starch) are reporting dramatic stabilization in blood sugar and weight, digestive improvements, and greatly improved sleep. I&#8217;m hoping that a lot of personal experimentation and self reporting, combined with gut sequencing services like American Gut and uBiome, will get us closer to figuring it out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My criticism of college education can be boiled down to this: It is too much one-size-fits-all. It takes too little account of differences between students. Those differences are no accident. They reflect the fact that a good economy needs to produce many different things. <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">Human nature has been shaped</a> to provide exactly that.</p>
<p>Bryan Caplan <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/12/seth_roberts_on.html">posted about this</a>, and one reader (Tim of Angle) replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Roberts is criticizing colleges for not doing something that they aren&#8217;t really trying to do. . . . Our educational model is built around hiring teachers who are (supposedly) good at thing X and paying them to train other people to do thing X. Nobody claims that the way the teacher does thing X is the only way to do thing X, nor even the best way to do thing X; what colleges do claim is that the way the teacher does thing X is a successful way to do thing X, and it hopes that the teacher can train students to do thing X competently at least the way the teacher does thing X.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was discussing undergraduate education at Berkeley. Berkeley professors are hired mainly based on their ability to do research. Undergraduate classes are not about training researchers (= the next generation of professors at research universities, such as Berkeley); that&#8217;s what graduate school is for.</p>
<p>In most Berkeley undergraduate classes, professors aren&#8217;t teaching students to &#8220;do&#8221; anything, at least anything that most of us would recognize as &#8220;doing&#8221;. (Engineering, art, architecture, foreign language and perhaps statistics classes are exceptions.) In most classes, students are introduced to an important fraction of an academic field. In a social psychology class, for example, they learn about social psychology research. The class is not about how to do social psychology. It is about what has been done and what has been learned. If the class consisted entirely of students who wanted to become psychology professors, that would be fine. In fact, only a small fraction of Berkeley psychology majors (5%?) go to graduate school in psychology. The students in most Berkeley classes (outside of the more vocational areas, such as engineering) will go on to do many different jobs. Few in any class will become professors.</p>
<p>I think one theory of higher education is close to what Tim of Angle says. The practice, at least at elite universities such as Berkeley, is quite different.</p>
<p>A different theory of higher education revolves around signalling. College performance provides a useful signal to future employers, that&#8217;s why it exists in present form. At Berkeley, I never heard this motivation (<em>will this provide a good signal to employers?</em>) brought up in discussions about grading or anything else. It&#8217;s utterly clear, on the other hand, that <em>where</em> you go to college (Harvard versus College of Marin) is indeed a powerful signal to employers and, yes, if you can go to Prestigious College X, you really should. How many &#8220;axes of excellence&#8221; there should be &#8212; how many separate categories or dimensions we should use to rank colleges &#8212; is a different discussion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best talks at the 2013 Ancestral Health Symposium was by Will Lassek, a retired doctor. Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>One puzzle is why human males have such a strong preference for women with hourglass figures and low weights that can compromise fertility. The second is why slender young women typically have about one third of their weight in body fat, more than bears starting to hibernate, and why human infants are also very fat. Finally, why do women typically gain another twenty pounds or more during their reproductive years? The answer may lie in the roles that fat plays in providing essential fatty acids needed for the growth of a very large brain and in regulating overall fetal growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>His answer to the first question was that death during childbirth was a serious danger. Women of lower weight give birth to babies with smaller heads &#8212; less likely to cause death. Wider hips means a larger birth canal. Women gain weight after their first birth because their birth canal is wider &#8212; the optimal baby size has gone up. A variety of data supported these ideas. Lessek&#8217;s answer to the first question is quite different than <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16818094" target="_blank">what evolutionary psychologists have said</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After hearing several people, including <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/interesting-software-watch-scapple-is-out-of-beta/275497/" target="_blank">James Fallows</a> (&#8220; the single best bargain ever offered in the software world&#8221;), praise <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php" target="_blank">Scrivener</a>, a software program for writing, I tried it again. I had tried it a year ago, but there were so many bugs I quickly stopped. There were fewer bugs this time, but my experience was not good.</p>
<p>The free-trial copy says you can use it for &#8220;30 non-consecutive days&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t know what that meant. I was told it means &#8220;30 separate days before the trial expires &#8212; the trial is measured in &#8220;days of use&#8221;, rather than elapsed time since installation&#8221;. Someone thought that would be clear? I suggest &#8220;30 not-necessarily-consecutive days&#8221; plus an explanation of what that means.</p>
<p>When I imported material from Microsoft Word &#8212; the most common possible import &#8212; links were lost. I filed a bug report. I got an answer: &#8220;Unfortunately that&#8217;s the reality of importing: some information can be lost when you move from one file format to another.&#8221; <em>Well, yes, but how about fixing the bug?</em> I asked. In reply, I was told that Scrivener for Windows was the work of one person and that the import software was third-party. &#8220;We are constantly striving to find new [import software], and to make improvements on our own, where we can,&#8221; said the spokesperson for Scrivener.</p>
<p>I used Scrivener for about two weeks. Then, trying to put a quotation block in my text, I found that particular formatting is not available. It has been a long time since I came across writing software that did not include quotation blocks. The final straw. I went back to Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>In a way, it&#8217;s a miracle I lasted two weeks, given the difference in resources invested in Microsoft Word and Scrivener for Windows.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People like complex flavors. I suppose this is why I prefer black tea to green tea. My evolutionary explanation is that this preference caused our ancestors to eat more bacteria-laden food. Bacteria make food taste more complex and bacteria-laden food are healthier than bacteria-free food.</p>
<p>Phil Alexander sent me a story from <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pgjACVyd_xMC&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> that illustrates this preference:</p>
<blockquote><p>We entered the saloon. Not a customer was there — a very surprising fact, considering that it was New Year&#8217;s Eve. The only person in sight was the bartender who paced back and forth in front of the bar like a caged beast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whatta you want?&#8221; he asked savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we just want a little New Year&#8217;s drink,&#8221; I returned. Winterbill was too surprised to say anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mix &#8216;em yourself,&#8221; the bartender replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m through with the saloon business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you feel that way about it,&#8221; I said, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you sell out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the first guy who offers me $300 can have the works.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somewhat amused and thinking he must be joking, I retorted, &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you $300 — provided it includes all your stock, the cash register, and other equipment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister, you&#8217;ve bought yourself a saloon!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not only include all the stock and equipment — I&#8217;ll throw in a full barrel of whiskey I&#8217;ve got in the basement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winterbill now joined in the fun and began to take an inventory.</p>
<p>The owner took off his apron and handed it to me. &#8220;Gimme the three hundred bucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gave him the money, still believing it was a joke. He put the money into his pocket, got his hat and coat and departed. To our complete bewilderment, we found ourselves in the saloon business.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, our first customer came in. He evidently had not made our place his first stop. I hurriedly put the apron over my evening clothes and asked for his order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martini,&#8221; he said in a thick voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martini,&#8221; I repeated to Winterbill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stall him!&#8221; Winterbill whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming right up,&#8221; I told the customer. He didn&#8217;t mind waiting. He was at the stage where he wanted to talk and so proceeded to do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Winterbill racked his brain, for he had only the vaguest idea how to mix a Martini. He finally settled upon a recipe. He put a dash of everything from the numerous bottles behind the bar into one drink. I stirred it up and handed it to the customer. We watched anxiously while he drank it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was good!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Best Martini I ever tasted. Mix me another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Winterbill started to mix.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; I inquired, none too sure of the consequences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; asked the customer. &#8220;Fine. Never felt better in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t show any bad results after the second drink, and we both were relieved. As time went on more customers came in. They ordered whiskey sours, Manhattans, and Martinis. Winterbill had just one formula and that&#8217;s what he gave them all. Nobody complained.</p>
<p>. . . By the time we closed that night we had taken in more than the whole outfit cost us!</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>When I took flaxseed oil capsules for reasons connected with the Shangri-La Diet, I noticed, to my surprise, that my balance improved. The next time I saw my dentist, he told me that my gums were much better. A reader of this blog named Chuck Currie has noticed the same things.</em></p>
<p>I ran across a reference to your book again which led me to your website. And, like I said, from there to Mark Sisson and all the rest. </p>
<p>I had already ran across information about flax oil and cholesterol and heart health. So I started taking two tablespoons a day [of flaxseed oil] &#8211; morning and night. I noticed my balance improvement while doing yoga, but thought it was due to practice. After reading several paleo blogs, I switched to fish oil &#8211; one table spoon a day in the morning. Then after reading some other studies regarding possible negative effects of over-consumption of fish oil, I stopped that also. </p>
<p>During this time I really became a strict paleo/primal eater and exerciser. No carbs other than leafy greens and non-starchy vegs. No more chronic cardio. Stopped swimming due to shoulder issues. Started using kettlebells and body weight tabata exercise. Went back and forth on supplementation.  My weight dropped to below 120. [He's 5 feet 8 inches tall.]</p>
<p>I was getting totally confused on what was legit and what was BS. Sure I lost weight, but I must have looked sick because people were asking if I was all right. I think they thought I had cancer or AIDS. I felt great though. No more 2 o&#8217;clock naps and I slept great. Then I read Kurt Harris&#8217;s 2.0 blog and that set me straight &#8211; and straight back to your blog. </p>
<p>It made me think, OK what works on the individual level, not the hypothesis level. I had also noticed that my balance had deteriorated (I thought it was because I stopped doing yoga) and my gums were bleeding again &#8211; I had forgotten that they had stopped bleeding. [After he switched from flaxseed oil to fish oil, his balance slowly got worse.] Sort of back to basics. Sun, lots of it, or D3 &#8211; 10,000 units (I am sitting in the sun as I type this on my iPhone).  Omega 3 &#8211; your posts about flax oil made sense &#8211; [sudden release of short-chain omega-3 causes] slow release [of long-chain omega-3] &#8211; and is more sustainable than cold water fish and fish oil. Magnesium at night for better sleep and muscle cramps. (when I first went full paleo, I suffered from terrible leg cramps during the night until I found magnesium). And extra butter &#8211; beyond cooking with it. </p>
<p>I tested the flax/balance question by continuing to not practice yoga or any other balancing exercises and [measure my balance] just using my ability to wash my feet in the shower without leaning against the wall &#8211; which had been my normal habit before my first improvement and then again when it went away. After about a week &#8211; perfect balance &#8211; both washing and drying my feet. Also, no gum bleeding. So as some would say, &#8220;the shit works&#8221;. </p>
<p>[He added later:] I can definitely say, with a high degree of confidence, that my balance is not as good when taking fish oil as it is when taking flax oil. Fish oil does provide a small improvement over not supplementing any omega-3. But the big improvement comes with flax oil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think <a href="http://hpr1.com/opinion/article/six_pounds_of_stuff/" target="_blank">this</a> actually happened:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man came to the [University of Pittsburgh] clinic with a chronic infection in his left ear.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a long time, nutrition experts have told us to replace saturated fats (solid at room temperature) with polyunsaturated fats (liquid at room temperature). One polyunsaturated fat is omega-6. Omega-6 is found in large amounts in corn oil, soybean oil, and most other vegetable oils (flaxseed oil is the big exception). According to <em>Eat Drink and Be Healthy</em> (2001) by Walter Willett (and &#8220;co-developed with the Harvard School of Public Health&#8221;), &#8220;replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats is a safe, proven, and delicious way to cut the rates of heart disease&#8221; (p. 71). &#8220;Plenty of proof for the benefits of unsaturated fats&#8221; says a paragraph heading (p. 71). Willett failed to distinguish between omega-3 and omega-6.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707" target="_blank">A recent study in the BMJ</a> shows how wrong Willett (and thousands like him) were. This study began with the assumption that omega-3 and omega-6 might have different effects, so it was a good idea to try to measure the effect of omega-6 separately.</p>
<p>They reanalyzed data from a study done in Sydney Australia from 1966 to 1973.The study had two groups: (a) a group of men not told to change their diet and (b) a group of men told to eat more omega-6 by eating more safflower oil (and reducing saturated fat intake, keeping overall fat intake roughly constant). The hope was that the change would reduce heart disease, as everyone said.</p>
<p>As these studies go, it was relatively small, only about 500 subjects. The main results:</p>
<blockquote><p>Compared with the control group, <strong>the intervention group had an increased risk of all cause mortality (17.6% v 11.8%</strong> [emphasis added]; hazard ratio 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.00 to 2.64); P=0.051), cardiovascular mortality (17.2% v 11.0%; 1.70 (1.03 to 2.80); P=0.037), and mortality from coronary heart disease (16.3% v 10.1%; 1.74 (1.04 to 2.92); P=0.036).</p></blockquote>
<p>A 50% increase in death rate! The safflower oil was so damaging that even this small study yielded significant differences.</p>
<p>The authors go on to show that this result (omega-6 is bad for you) is supported by other studies. Walter Willett and countless other experts were quite wrong on the biggest health issue of our time (how to reduce heart disease, the #1 cause of death).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had pizza at the home of my friends Bridget and Carl. It tasted divine. The crust was puffy, chewy and the right amount. The thin-crust bottom was slightly crunchy.  The tomato sauce had depth. The toppings (two kinds of mushrooms, Jerusalem artichokes, zucchini, onions, goat cheese) were tasty, creamy and a little crunchy. It was pretty and three-dimensional. It was easily the best pizza I&#8217;d ever had, the best home cooking I&#8217;d ever had, and much better than the lamb I&#8217;d had at Chez Panisse the night before, although the lamb was excellent. The pizza hadn&#8217;t been hard to make nor were the ingredients expensive. <em>Do other people wonder why this is so good? </em>I asked my friends.</p>
<p>At some level I knew why it was so good &#8212; why the sauce was so good, for example (see below). The puzzle &#8212; let me call it the Pizza Paradox &#8212; was that commercial pizza, even at fancy restaurants (such as Chez Panisse), is so much worse. <span id="more-9815"></span>In restaurants, pizza-makers make dozens of pizzas per day. Business success is on the line. That should push them to do better. Professional cooks study cooking, have vast experience. They use a pizza oven. My friends have never studied cooking, never cooked professionally. They might make pizza once/month. Nothing is on the line. My friends don&#8217;t have a pizza oven. High-end restaurant pizza should be <strong>much</strong> better, but the opposite was true.</p>
<p>In my experience, high-end restaurant food usually<strong> </strong>is much better than home-cooked versions. Why is high-end pizza a big exception &#8212; at least, compared to Bridget and Carl&#8217;s version?</p>
<p>My explanation has two parts. First, the concept of pizza is brilliant. It <span>taps more sources of pleasure than any other food I can think of. Chewiness from crust. Fat from cheese. Umami, sweet, and sour from tomato sauce. Protein from cheese and meat. Complexity of flavor from sauce and toppings. Variety of texture from toppings and crust. Variety of flavor from toppings. Attractive appearance from toppings and bright red tomato sauce. Most foods fail to tap most of these sources. For example, a soft drink isn&#8217;t chewy, doesn&#8217;t have protein, doesn&#8217;t have fat, doesn&#8217;t have variety of texture or variety of flavor, and isn&#8217;t attractive.</span></p>
<p>My friends had one goal: to make the best possible pizza. It couldn&#8217;t take too long or cost too much but they weren&#8217;t trying to save time or cut costs. Over the years, they tweaked the recipe various ways and their pizza got better and better. Experimentation was safe. If a variation made things worse, it didn&#8217;t matter. It would still taste plenty good. (Due to the brilliance of pizza.) Variation was fun. After making pizza in a new way, they&#8217;d eat the pizza themselves (with guests) and find out if the new twist made a difference.</p>
<p>Professional pizza makers don&#8217;t do this. After a restaurant opens, they make pizza roughly the same way forever. The pizza at Chez Panisse, for example, looks the same now as many years ago. The owner might want to make the best possible pizza but is unlikely to experiment month after month year after year. The actual cooks just want to make satisfactory pizza. Making the best possible pizza is not part of the job. The owner might benefit from better pizza but the cooks would not. They&#8217;re cranking it out under time pressure (watch <em>Hell&#8217;s Kitchen</em>). They do what they&#8217;re told. Owners fear experimentation: It might be worse. It won&#8217;t be what&#8217;s expected. Don&#8217;t mess with success.</p>
<p>This illustrates what I&#8217;ve said many times: <em>job and science don&#8217;t mix well</em>. To do the best possible science or make the best possible pizza, you need freedom to experiment. People with jobs get stuck. All jobs &#8212; including professor at research university, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/03/05/a-revolution-in-growing-rice/" target="_blank">rice grower</a>, and pizza maker &#8212; depend on steady output of the same thing again and again. Trying to maximize short-term output interferes with long-term improvement. To do the best possible science or make the best possible pizza, you also need the right motivation: You care about nothing else. People with jobs have many goals. This is why we need personal science: To overcome the (serious) limitations of professional science.</p>
<p>All this should be obvious, but curiously isn&#8217;t. Long ago, philosophers such as John Stuart Mill claimed that people &#8220;maximized utility&#8221;, apparently not realizing that maximizing output (which happens when people work &#8220;hard&#8221;) slows down or prevents innovation. Later thinkers, such as Frederick Hayek and <a href="http://www.marketobservation.com/blogs/index.php/2012/05/17/milton-friedman-on-innovation?blog=10">Milton Friedman</a>, glorified markets. They too failed to grasp, or at least say anywhere, that market demands get in the way of innovation.</p>
<p>The recipe for my friends&#8217;s pizza had several non-obvious features:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Pizza dough from Trader Joe&#8217;s</strong>. At Chez Panisse and other high-end restaurants, this would be taboo. It might produce better results &#8212; you still couldn&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Pizza stones above and below the pizza</strong>. My friends use an ordinary oven. Maybe an ordinary oven with two pizza stones produces better results than a pizza oven.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Balsamic vinegar in the tomato sauce</strong>. They got the idea from a friend. American cooks, including professional ones, routinely fail to understand how much fermented foods (such as balsamic vinegar) can improve taste. My friends also use more traditional flavorings (marjoram, basil, and garlic) in the tomato sauce.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Plenty of goat cheese</strong>. They scatter goat cheese slices over the top of the sauce.</p>
<p>There you have the secret of Bridget and Carl&#8217;s Pizza.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine taught at Harvard for a few years. Her husband needed a job, so he taught a writing class. He said his students were so bad it appeared to be an experiment: <em>How stupid can you be and succeed at Harvard? </em>They had not been admitted based on SAT scores or grades, that was clear. In <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/">a recent article called &#8220;The Myth of American Meritocracy&#8221;</a>, Ron Unz described considerable evidence of exactly what my friend&#8217;s husband noticed: Harvard admission not based on the usual &#8220;meritocratic&#8221; measures, such as SAT scores and grades. For example, he found evidence of an Asian quota. If Asians weren&#8217;t penalized for being Asian, far more would be admitted.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/meritocracy-admitting-my-mistakes/" target="_blank">a follow-up article</a>, Unz wrote:<span id="more-9627"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Near the beginning of my article [about meritocracy] I had noted that although complaints about official corruption of every sort are a leading topic on the Chinese Internet and also in Western media coverage, I had never once heard such a claim about admissions to elite Chinese universities.  This led me to conclude that the process was entirely meritocratic, and a couple of individuals with good knowledge of China confirmed this.  However, during one of my recent Yale Law events, a student from China stated that he and his friends were firmly convinced that any of China’s 350 Central Committee members could easily obtain an admissions slot for his friends or relatives, so my claim was incorrect.  This conflicting evidence may be reconciled if the number of such corrupt admissions each year is so tiny—perhaps a few hundred out of over eight million—that it is completely invisible to the general public.  I should note that the New York Times just ran another major story on colleges in China, emphasizing every possible unfair aspect of the system, but nonetheless indicating that admissions were entirely meritocratic and objective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is one reason that there is zero discussion of corruption in admission to elite Chinese universities (such as Tsinghua, where I teach): Rich Chinese universally want their children to go to college outside China, especially America. The more money you have, the easier this is. I&#8217;d guess <strong>all</strong> children of Central Committee members attend college outside China. None of them attend Tsinghua, as far as I know. At least among my students, this is utterly obvious &#8212; that education outside China is superior and anyone who can go outside China will. The brake on this is purely cost. One of my students said she didn&#8217;t want to burden her parents with the cost.</p>
<p>The test that Chinese high school students take to get into college is the <em>gaokao</em>. One of my students got <strong>the highest <em>gaokao</em> score in Beijing</strong>. An astonishing achievement. <em>He didn&#8217;t get in to any American university</em>.<em> </em>The Chinese public was shocked. Many newspaper articles were written about it. The rest of my students knew about it. His family is not well-off. This is why he failed where thousands of Chinese students from rich families &#8212; who didn&#8217;t bother to take the <em>gaokao, </em>but surely would have had a lower score &#8211; succeeded. Although he went to Tsinghua as a freshman, he too wanted to escape Chinese higher education. First he transferred to the University of Hong Kong. Then he transferred to MIT.</p>
<p>Why is Chinese higher education so bad that everyone who can avoids it? One of my students (a psychology major) said that as the economy quickly improved, the government quickly expanded the college education system. There weren&#8217;t enough good teachers to fill the slots. That&#8217;s one reason. Another reason is a certain ethos. I asked a friend of mine, a Tsinghua student not majoring in psychology, &#8220;In what fraction of your classes do the professors lecture by reading from the textbook?&#8221; 80%, she said. That&#8217;s at Tsinghua. Below Tsinghua it&#8217;s worse. Of course students go to college outside China for reasons that have nothing to do with quality. The most obvious is prestige: It is prestigious to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Lack of higher education meritocracy in China has a more subtle aspect. It is much easier to get into elite universities, such as Tsinghua, if you live in Beijing or Shanghai than if you live elsewhere, especially poor provinces. Is this unfair? It isn&#8217;t easy to say because the <em style="font-size: 13px;">gaokao</em> is different in different places. I don&#8217;t know the official reason for this (different textbooks?), but the difference in tests makes it easier to have lower admissions cutoff scores for students from Beijing and Shanghai. A Beijing student at Tsinghua will usually have a lower <em style="font-size: 13px;">gaokao</em> score than a student at Tsinghua from a poor province. Of course it is much more expensive to live in Beijing and Shanghai than elsewhere. Moreover, a big chunk of the <em style="font-size: 13px;">gaokao</em> is about English proficiency. A student&#8217;s English proficiency depends heavily on amount and quality of English education, which depends heavily on family income. The richer you are, the better your children&#8217;s English.</p>
<p>All this makes political sense. Richer people &#8212; whose children have better English &#8212; have more political power than the less rich. Those who live in Beijing and Shanghai have more political power than people in poor provinces. Allowing their children get into Tsinghua with lower <em>gaokao </em>scores (Beijing and Shanghai residents) or writing the <em>gaokao</em> so that their children have an advantage (English proficiency) is one way to keep them happy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wonder how to encourage personal science (= science done to help yourself or a loved one, usually for health reasons). Please respond in the comments or by emailing me.</p>
<p>An obvious example of personal science is self-measurement (blood tests, acne, sleep, mood, whatever)  done to improve what you&#8217;re measuring. Science is more than data collection and the data need not come from you. You might study blogs and forums or the scientific literature to get ideas. Self-measurement and data analysis by non-professionals is much easier than ever before. Other people&#8217;s experience and the scientific literature are much more available than ever before. This makes personal science is far more promising than ever before.</p>
<p>Personal science has great promise for reasons that aren&#8217;t obvious. It seems to be a balancing act: Personal science has strengths and weakness, professional science has strengths and weaknesses.  I can say that personal scientists can do research much faster than professionals and are less burdened with conflicts of interest (personal scientists care only about finding a solution; professionals care about other things, including publication, grants, prizes, respect, and so on). A professional scientist might reply that professional scientists have more training and support. History overwhelming favors professional science &#8212; at least until you realize that Galileo, Darwin, Mendel, and Wegener (continental drift) were not professional scientists. (Galileo was a math professor.) There is very little personal science of any importance.</p>
<p>These arguments (balancing act, examination of history) miss something important. In a way, it <strong>isn&#8217;t</strong> a balancing act. Professional science and personal science do different things. In some ways history <strong>supports</strong> personal science. Let me give an example. I believe my most important discovery will turn out to be <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/morning-faces-therapy-resources/" target="_blank">the effect of morning faces on mood</a>. The basic idea that my findings support is that we have a mood control system that requires seeing faces in the morning to work properly. When the system is working properly, we have a circadian rhythm in mood (happy, eager, serene during the day, unhappy, reluctant, irritable at night). The strangest thing is that if you see faces in the morning (e.g, 7 am) they have no noticeable effect until 6 pm the same day. There is a kind of uncanny valley at work here. If you know little about mood research, this will seem unlikely but possible. If you are an average professional mood researcher, it will seem much worse: <strong>can&#8217;t possibly be true, total nonsense</strong>. If you know a lot about depression research, however, you will know that there is considerable supporting research (e.g., in many cases, depression gets better in the evening). It will still seem very unlikely, but not impossible. However, if you&#8217;re a professional scientist, <strong>it doesn&#8217;t matter what you think</strong>. You cannot study it. It is too strange to too many people, including your colleagues. You risk ridicule by studying it. If you&#8217;re a personal scientist, of course you can study it. You can study anything.</p>
<p>This illustrates a structural problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-28-personal-professional-science-in-plausibility-space.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9699" alt="2013-02-28 personal &amp; professional science in plausibility space" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-28-personal-professional-science-in-plausibility-space-591x300.jpeg" width="800" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This graph shows what personal and professional scientists can do. Ideas vary in plausibility from low to high; data gathering (e.g., experiments) varies in cost from low to high. Personal scientists can study ideas of any plausibility, but they have a relatively small budget. Professional scientists can spend much more &#8212; in fact, <strong>must </strong>spend much more. I suppose publishing a cheap experiment would be like wearing cheap clothes. Another limitation of professional scientists is that they can only study ideas of medium plausibility.  Ideas of low plausibility (such as my morning faces idea) are &#8220;crazy&#8221;. To take them seriously risks ridicule. Even if you don&#8217;t care what your colleagues think, there is the additional problem that a test of them is unlikely to pay off. You cannot publish results showing that a low-plausibility idea is wrong. Too obvious. In addition, professional scientists cannot study ideas of <strong>high </strong>plausibility. Again, the only publishable result would be that your test shows the idea is wrong. That is unlikely to happen. You cannot publish results that show that something that everybody already believes is true.</p>
<p>It is a bad idea for anyone &#8212; personal or professional scientist &#8212; to spend a lot of resources testing an idea of low or high plausibility. If the idea has low plausibility, the outcome is too likely to be &#8220;it&#8217;s wrong&#8221;. There are a vast number of low-plausibility ideas. No one can afford to spend a lot of money on one of them. Likewise, it&#8217;s a bad idea to spend a lot of resources testing an idea of high plausibility because the information value (information/dollar) of the test is likely to be low. If you&#8217;re going to spend a lot of money, you should do it only when both possible outcomes (true and false) are plausible.</p>
<p>This graph explains why health science has so badly stagnated &#8212; every year, the Nobel Prize in Medicine is given for something relatively trivial &#8212; and why personal science can make a big difference. Health science has stagnated because it is impossible for professionals to study ideas of low plausibility. Yet every new idea begins with low plausibility. The Shangri-La Diet is an example (Drink sugar water to lose weight? Are you <strong>crazy</strong>?). We need personal science to find plausible new ideas. We also need personal science at the other extreme (high plausibility) to customize what we know. Everyone has their quirks and differences. No matter how well-established a solution, it needs to be tailored to you in particular &#8212; to what you eat, when you work, where you live, and so on. Professional scientists won&#8217;t do that. My personal science started off with customization. I tested various acne drugs that my dermatologist prescribed. It turned out that one of them didn&#8217;t work. It worked in general, just not for me. As I did more and more personal science, I started to discover that certain low-plausibility ideas were true. I&#8217;d guess that 99.99% of professional scientists never discover that a low-plausibility idea is true. Whereas I&#8217;ve made several such discoveries.</p>
<p>Professional scientists need personal scientists to come up with new ideas plausible enough to be worth testing. The rest of us need personal scientists for the sake of our health. We need them to find new solutions and  customize existing ones.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A restaurant near Seoul named Bean Table got <a href="http://www.seouleats.com/2013/01/shitty-family-dinner-restaurant-bean-table/">a surprisingly bad review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then came a massive chicken salad dish, given the number of people we had we over ordered. The patrons we brought were split 50/50 on enjoyment for the chicken. We had so much leftovers and were wasting so much food, I asked the waiter to wrap the leftovers. . . . Asking the waiter to wrap this chicken came with a resounding “no”, so again to the kitchen to talk to a manager. Actually ended up talking to a chef, a young man who speaks good English, who also declined our request. We had a six year old and a three year old with us and that was the only food they were eating minus the pungent sauce.</p>
<p>Our driver then proceeded to get angry and went to talk to the chef, Sungmo Lee, and surprisingly Mr. Lee and our driver had a conversation that the whole restaurant could hear despite repeated requests by our driver to discuss outside. As that incident occurred being concerned for my family who flew on average 7,000 miles and were picked up for a total driving commute of two hours to come eat at this restaurant I went to calm both parties down. Things progressed from worse to horrible. I identified myself as a food critic, and Mr. Lee proceeded to take that as a threat and stated, “You don’t know who I am.” . . . . My father, a man in his 70′s, tried to speak reason to him only to be found that we were asked to leave.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, police were called, we weren&#8217;t allowed to pay the bill till police arrived even after we stated we wished to leave and skip the remaining courses. Police came and scolded Mr. Lee, telling him that if a customer pays for food then containers should be allowed for the customers to take food home. Keep in mind we are talking about cooked chicken, not fish, or tartar, etc. (Mr. Lee’s argument was that there were no take out containers in the restaurant and remained adamant about the no take out policy when we asked the driver to buy some containers). After the police came they asked us to leave while they dealt with Mr. Lee only to find an employee chasing out bus to pay the bill. No discounts, full price and another time suck of 20-30 minutes and the rest of the meal was safely kept in their fridge due to their “no takeout” policy. . . .</p>
<p>Before all of this nonsense came down my whole Korean family all thought that the restaurant was over rated and there was no single outstanding dish.</p></blockquote>
<p>Until the Internet, stuff like this was never reported.</p>
