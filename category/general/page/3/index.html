				<div class="entry">
					<p>In a discussion of college education &#8212; I believe there should be <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf">more allowance for human diversity</a> &#8212; sparked by <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/08/a-spontaneous-order-firm.html">this post</a>, Alex Tabarrok told the following story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tyler [Cowen] once walked into class the day of the final exam and said, &#8220;Here is the exam. Write your own questions. Write your own answers. Harder questions and better answers get more points.&#8221; Then he walked out. The funniest thing was when a student came in late and I had to explain to him what the exam was and he didn&#8217;t believe me!</p></blockquote>
<p>I was impressed. This approach, unlike most exams but like actual economies, rewards rather than punishes specialization. I asked Tyler what happened. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would say that the variance of the test scores probably increased!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall if I ever did that again for a whole exam but most of my exams do that for at least one question.  It&#8217;s the question where you learn the most about the student.</p></blockquote>

				<small>Saturday, July 14th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>One day in 2009, I ate a large amount of pork belly (very high in fat &#8212; pork belly is the cut used to make bacon). That night I slept an unusually long time. The next day I had more energy than usual. This led me to do an experiment in which I ate a pork belly meal (with lots of pork belly, about 250 g) on some days but not others. I compared my sleep after the two sorts of days. I kept constant the number of one-legged stands I did each day because <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">that has an effect</a>. During the first half of the experiment I kept this constant at 4; during the second half, at 2. I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2009/10/31/effect-of-animal-fat-on-sleep-more/">originally posted the results</a> only from the first half.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve analyzed the results from both halves. Here are ratings of how rested I felt when I woke up, on a scale where 0 = 0% = not rested at all and 100 = 100% = completely rested.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012-07-15-effect-of-pork-fat-on-rested-ratings.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7096" title="2012-07-15 effect of pork fat on rested ratings" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012-07-15-effect-of-pork-fat-on-rested-ratings-591x300.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>The two halves were essentially the same: pork belly produced a big improvement.  Here are the results for sleep duration.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012-07-15-effect-of-pork-fat-on-sleep-duration1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7093" title="2012-07-15 effect of pork fat on sleep duration" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012-07-15-effect-of-pork-fat-on-sleep-duration1-591x300.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>No clear effect of pork belly in either half of the experiment.</p>
<p>The main thing I learned was that pork fat really helps. The effect is remarkably clear. With micronutrients, such as Vitamin C, the body has considerable storage. It may take months without the nutrient to become noticeably deficient. With omega-3, which is between a micronutrient and a macronutrient, my experiments found that it takes about two  days to start to see deficiency. With pork fat there seems to be no storage at all. I needed to eat lots of pork fat every day to get the best sleep. That repletion and depletion are fast made this experiment easy. How curious we are so often told animal fat is bad when an easy experiment shows it is good, at least for me.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I recently got the following email:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I googled &#8220;dreamhost sucks&#8221; and found your blog. I really hate this company. I have a small business and they somehow managed to create a second account for my company in spite of the fact that we never requested one.  Then they emailed us that we owed more money on our account and shut off our access and emails due to the amount overdue.  After months of various DH staffers replying to my emails (we hadn&#8217;t ever selected phone support so they would only correspond via email) the problems were finally passed to a &#8220;supervisor&#8221;.  The supervisor promptly cancelled the duplicate account and reset our live and fully paid account so that we could use it again.  This took months of frustration and provision of the same information to the different DH staffers.  There is obviously no communications within their staff there.  Very frustrating.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Today, they sent an email to me requesting an additional albeit minor sum of $9.95 for a temporary account that was created when nobody at my company could access our account.  They insist we created it and pay for it or they&#8217;ll suspend our live account.  I complained and asked for the same supervisor that resolved DH&#8217;s past errors, and the staffer, Jay H, promptly cancelled our fully paid, live account, and told me we still had to pay for this temporary account created by a DH staffer when we didn&#8217;t even have access to our site and emails due to DH&#8217;s original errors!!</div>
<div></div>
<div>So frustrating. I&#8217;m now looking for a new domain and web host company, with excellent customer service and professionalism.  DH doesn&#8217;t take responsibility for their own errors and seems to dream up ways to charge clients extra money for stuff they never requested. Outside of the online world, this would be called extortion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Feel free to post. I hate Dreamhost!</div>
</blockquote>

<div id=":35g" data-tooltip="Show trimmed content"><img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/images/cleardot.gif" alt="" />As do I. I wish I had left the second I discovered they hadn&#8217;t backed up my site, after saying they had. (They had backed up only a small fraction of it.) After that, my sites kept getting hacked. First, we moved this blog and www.sethroberts.net off Dreamhost. They stopped getting hacked. Then the Shangri-La Diet forums got hacked. We moved them off Dreamhost. No more hacking. The cost of even one incident of hacking is far more than you will ever save from their low rates.</div>

					<p>One of my friends loves her Ipad so I decided to get one. On the same day I started looking at options Microsoft announced their tablet, the Surface. It sounded good. I decided to do more research.</p>
<p>I went to the Apple Store in Palo Alto. The main things I will do with my Ipad are read books and magazines and watch movies. I asked to see a movie on &#8220;the new Ipad&#8221;. No movies were available, so I watched a trailer for <em>Brave</em>. It was not a good experience. Lots of glare. <em>How much worse could the Surface be?</em> I wondered.</p>
<p>I was curious about the new naming policy. No &#8220;Ipad 3&#8243;, just &#8220;the new Ipad&#8221;. &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t this called the Ipad 3?&#8221; I asked an employee. &#8220;Company policy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s the reason for the policy?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;They don&#8217;t tell us that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I left the store thinking I would wait for the Surface. Later that day I had lunch with a friend, <a href="http://steveomohundro.com/">Steve Omohundro</a>, who (with colleagues) long ago predicted the tablet computer and won a design competition (possibly sponsored by Apple) for doing so. He and his colleagues gave a talk about it and Steve Jobs was in the audience. I forgot to ask him what he thinks of the Ipad and the Surface.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, June 20th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>My self-experimentation began because of one tiny thing &#8212; <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2319737">an article</a> I noticed in the Brown University Science Library about teaching mathematics to college students. &#8220;The best way to learn is to do,&#8221; it started. Which made sense. To learn how to do experiments &#8212; one of my goals as a graduate student &#8212; I started doing self-experiments. Let&#8217;s imagine I had never seen that article, which is entirely possible. In this parallel universe, I become a psychology professor and then one day notice that someone else has done the personal science I have actually done. Has written &#8220;<a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">Self-experimentation as a source of new ideas</a>,&#8221; <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>, and so on, including the experiments I&#8217;ve described on this blog. How would I react?</p>
<p>Many things about it would not impress me. <em>You devised an arithmetic test to measure your brain function &#8212; so what?</em> <em>You measured yourself for a long time &#8212; big deal. You did an experiment &#8212; yawn</em>. I might be slightly impressed by the experimental designs, which are simple and effective. Most experimental psychology uses more complex designs. What would baffle me would be the discovery of safe powerful beneficial treatments. <em>How did this guy find these treatments?</em> For example, the first experiment in &#8220;Self-experimentation as a source of new ideas&#8221; is about the effect of breakfast on early awakening. Eliminating breakfast reduced the fraction of days with early awakening from about 50% to 10%. Not eating breakfast is easy and perfectly safe. I don&#8217;t know of anything like this in all sleep research.</p>
<p>To a psychology professor, doing an experiment on one&#8217;s sleep is nothing. Finding something naturalistic (= not a drug) and sustainable that caused a big improvement, however, would be . . . unprecedented? Seemingly impossible? Psychology professors study everyday topics of great interest, such as memory and problem-solving and happiness, quite often. They would love to find easy safe sustainable non-drug ways of improving these things by large amounts. But I can&#8217;t think of a single example.</p>
<p>I thought about how hard it is to find big beneficial experimental effects (it&#8217;s easy to make things worse) when I read <a href="http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/it-all-began-with-a-strange-email/">this post</a> by the economist Yanis Varoufakis. He is excited about working for an online game company (Valve) because the nature of their game will allow experimental study of economics.</p>
<blockquote><p>Econometrics is a travesty! . . . Econometrics purports to test economic theories by statistical means. And yet what it ends up testing is whether some ‘reduced form’, an equation (or system of equations), that is consistent with one’s theory, is also consistent with the data. The problem of course is that the ‘reduced form’ under test can be shown to be consistent with an infinity of competing theories. Thus, econometrics can only pretend to discriminate between mutually contradictory theories. All it does is to discover empirical regularities lacking any causal meaning. [Why is he sure they lack any causal meaning? -- Seth]. . . The reason for this unavoidable failure? None other than our inability to run experiments on a macroeconomy such as rewinding time to, say, 1932, in order to see whether the US would have rebounded without the New Deal (or to 2009 to see what would have happened to the US economy without Ben Bernanke’s Quantitative Easing). Even at the level of the microeconomy, keeping faith with the ceteris paribus assumption (i.e. keeping all other things equal in order to measure, e.g., the relationship between the price of and the demand for milk) is impossible (as opposed to just hard).</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to our incapacity to perform truly scientific tests in ‘normal’ economic settings, Valve’s digital economies are a marvelous test-bed for meaningful experimentation. . . . We can change the economy’s underlying values, rules and settings, and then sit back to observe how the community responds, how relative prices change, the new behavioural patterns that evolve. An economist’s paradise indeed…</p></blockquote>
<p>I find this baffling. It&#8217;s like thinking: <em>Now I can write. Soon I will be writing stuff that the world wants to read! </em>Okay, now he can do experiments. Good. After a few of them, I suppose, he will learn what every experimental scientist knows and confronts every working day: it is incredibly hard to do <strong>interesting</strong> experiments. <em></em>The &#8220;sharp contrast&#8221; between the new setting and the old one has yet to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>Okay, how <strong>did</strong> I find a bunch of big beneficial safe sustainable effects? I am now finishing a paper in which I try to answer this question. To be brief: 1. <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf">As I&#8217;ve said</a>, I believe that the distribution of surprise/observation follows a power-law-like distribution. Almost all observations, very little surprise, a tiny fraction of observations, great surprise. Which is pretty obvious. 2. The &#8220;slope&#8221; (parameter) of the distribution depends on subject-matter knowledge (more knowledge = more favorable slope, i.e., &#8220;chance favors the prepared mind&#8221;), scientific skill (more skill = more favorable slope), and novelty (more novelty = more favorable slope). I was in good shape on all three. For example, when I studied sleep, I knew a lot about sleep. Novelty is enormously important. In my personal science I could easily study treatments (e.g., not eating breakfast) and dimensions (e.g., how rested I felt when I awoke) that had rarely if ever been studied before. I could do this again and again, keeping novelty high and thus keeping the slope very favorable. (Varoufakis will get a burst of novelty when he begins experimentation (the situation is new) but forced to use that situation for all his experiments the novelty will run down, making the slope of the distribution less favorable.) 3. My cost/observation was very low and the benefit/observation remarkably high (I was improving my own health). So I was very motivated to make observations. My answer in the paper is a little more complicated but that&#8217;s most of it.</p>

				<small>Thursday, June 14th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve measured my fasting blood sugar (= blood sugar before breakfast) for about four years. I began out of curiosity but became alarmed when the values approached &#8220;pre-diabetic&#8221; (&gt; 100 mg/dl, diabetic is 126 mg/dl or so). Eventually I learned that walking an hour/day put them in the 80&#8242;s consistently. Perhaps 84 is optimal, who knows.</p>
<p>I have used Abbott test meters and strips. They need so little blood that testing is painless. Recently (January 2012?) Abbott introduced new &#8220;butterfly&#8221; test strips that &#8220;wick&#8221; the blood. The meters stayed exactly the same. The new test strips are certainly better. I started to use them. I started using them after a gap (a month?). All of a sudden my scores were about 5 mg/dl better &#8212; for example, 84 instead of 89. I assumed this was due to lifestyle changes on my part. I was walking more, I was more muscular, whatever. These were plausible explanations. Surely Abbott had not corrected a huge mistake (given the size of the business, the importance of diabetes, and the need for accurate test strips, to be consistently off by 5 mg/dl would be a huge mistake).</p>
<p>Now I wonder. I recently found some old-style test strips, barely expired (2012/04). I have compared them to the new-style strips (expiration 2013/06). Here are my results:</p>
<p>Morning 1. New: 81, 84. Old: 99, 91, 100.</p>
<p>Morning 2. New: 80. Old: 96, 94, 95.</p>
<p>Morning 3. New: 84. Old: 104, 97, 105.</p>
<p>Morning 4. New: 86. Old: 101, 100, 100.</p>
<p>These results involve three different meters. The old strips come from three separate vials.  It is clear that the old strips produce readings much higher (about 15 mg/dl higher)  than the new strips.</p>
<p>The old strips are expired but I doubt they got 15 mg/dl worse in 1-2 months. I expect they are accurate when they leave the factory and slowly get worse. Now I have some idea of how much worse (and in what direction). Apparently there is a big increase in bias with little increase in variability. I&#8217;ve gone from batch to batch before and never noticed a difference. Only when comparing the new strips with the old has a difference been clear. The earlier comparison, with a 5 mg/dl difference, compared unexpired old strips with the new strips.</p>
<p>I conclude that with the old strips, deterioration with age is worse than I expected and I should pay more attention to test strip age.</p>

Improve Immune Function">What to Do About Antibiotic Resistance? Improve Immune Function</a></h3>
				<small>Tuesday, June 5th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I recently got a flyer from my HMO. &#8220;Feel better soon . . . without antibiotics!&#8221; said the front page. &#8220;Antibiotics <strong>do not</strong> kill viruses&#8221; said the second page. Apparently the point of the flyer is to reduce antibiotic usage. I am surprised that doctors need protection from patients asking for antibiotics for viral diseases.</p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is a problem, yes, but the bigger problem is how those who run our health care system ignore the immune system. Here are examples:</p>
<p>1. The historical solution to the problem of antibiotic resistance has been to develop new antibiotics. The problem has not stimulated research into how to strengthen the immune system. Here is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1509257">a 1992 editorial in <em>Science</em></a>: &#8220;Mechanisms such as antibiotic control programs, better hygiene [= more handwashing], and synthesis of agents with improved antimicrobial activity need to be adopted in order to limit bacterial resistance.&#8221; Nothing about improving immune function. <a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2012/9789241503181_eng.pdf">A 2012 World Health Organization report about the problem</a> does not contain the word <em>immune</em>.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html">The idiocy of tonsillectomies</a>. Forty years after researchers figured out that tonsils are part of the immune system, tonsillectomies remain common. Removing tonsils because of too many infections makes as much sense as removing part of the brain because of memory loss. I have never encountered a doctor who appears to understand this.</p>
<p>3. Epidemiologists have yet to systematically study what makes the immune system more or less powerful. For example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Epidemiology-Introduction-Kenneth-J-Rothman/dp/0195135547">this epidemiology textbook</a> does not contain the word <em>immune</em>. Nor does <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1060557/pdf/jepicomh00180-0002.pdf">this review</a> of 25 epidemiology textbooks.</p>
<p>4. A respected professor of pharmacology at the University College London named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Colquhoun">David Colquhoun</a> left <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/09/09/acupuncture-critic-misses-big-points/#comment-925422">the following comment</a> on this blog: &#8220;Talking of made up theories, the corniest of all has to be “stimulating the immune system”. There is [not], and never has been, any evidence that it happens &#8212; it is the eternal mantra of every quack who is trying to sell you their own brand of implausible therapy.&#8221; <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100307215534.htm">Here</a> is an example of the evidence he says doesn&#8217;t exist. Professor Colquhoun is a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>
<p>5. I know very little about the immune system. I barely know what a T cell is. My job (psychology professor) has nothing to do with it. Yet I have come up with three ideas related to it: 1. Tonsillectomies are idiotic. 2. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/the-unami-hypothesis-why-i-believe-fermented-foods-are-necessary-for-health/">We need regular intake of microbes to be healthy</a> &#8212; in part to stimulate the immune system. 3. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/10/why-we-touch-our-mouths-so-often-forewarned-is-forearmed/">We need exposure in small amounts to the germs around us for our immune systems to best protect us</a>. (So it&#8217;s not obvious that outside of hospitals more handwashing is a good thing.) Only because these ideas are obvious (#1 and #3) or semi-obvious (#2) was someone as ignorant as me able to think of them. That one ignorant outsider thought of three of these things before the hundreds of thousands of health researchers did suggests how little they think about the immune system.</p>
<p>Someday the people in charge of our health care &#8212; or the rest of us, ignoring them &#8212; will figure out how to make our immune systems work much better. We will sleep much better, eat much more fermented foods, take enough Vitamin D at the right time of day, and so on. Perhaps we will wash our hands <strong>less</strong> and kiss <strong>more</strong>. Antibiotic usage will go way down, selection for resistant microbes will become much less intense, and antibiotic-resistant microbes will become much less common. The problem will disappear.</p>

					<p><a href="http://challengingturing.org/">This series of posts</a> about a proposed Alan Turing conference at Stanford left me wondering about the best academic novels I had read. <em>Pnin</em> is good, but not very academic. <em>Gone</em> by Renata Adler is fantastic but about office politics. I didn&#8217;t like <em>Changing Places</em> nor <em>Lucky Jim</em>. I doubt a novel could be better than this:</p>
<blockquote><p>A couple of days later we received a note from Lester Earnest to say he was withdrawing from the committee. Since Les was underwriting the event this was a blow; we had lost our funding.</p>
<p>I wrote to Les asking him what had happened, knowing that the exchange with [Jennifer] Widom [chair of the Stanford CS department] over the December holiday was surely sufficient to deter and depress anyone.</p>
<p>A few hours later Ed Feigenbaum wrote to the committee saying that he had not spoken to Les but that he would withdraw from the committee himself. This puzzled both me and Les because Les had just told me that Ed that had talked him out of supporting the conference.</p></blockquote>

					<p>Everyone knows that Chinese media is heavily censored. I recently learned from my Chinese tutor, who is from Korea, that the South Korean media delights in spreading China-is-scary-and-weird stories, which tend to be censored in China. Here are examples:</p>
<p>1. A frozen dumpling made in China contained part of a cigarette. Someone took a picture and posted it. Someone from Korea noticed before it was censored. News of this spread all over South Korea.</p>
<p>2. Someone in China took a picture of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province full of pill containers (e.g., blue/green capsules) floating on the surface. Censored in China, the picture was publicized widely in South Korea. I saw it on my teacher&#8217;s cell phone.</p>
<p>Along similar lines, on May 2, a Korean journalist reported that she secretly entered a factory where medical pills were being made and found that among the ingredients were human baby parts. It sounds impossible, yes, but that is what was reported. (I wrote this several days ago, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2140702/South-Korea-customs-officials-thousands-pills-filled-powdered-human-baby-flesh.html">I should have posted it sooner</a>.)</p>
<p>“I never take Chinese medicines,” said my teacher. I asked her why the Korean media like these stories so much. “They show that something impossible is happening in China,&#8221; she said.</p>

In an essay called &#8220;<a href="http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/veblen/vested">The Vested Interests and the Common Man</a>&#8221; he <a href="http://forums.infoshop.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=9007">pointed out</a> &#8220;the existence of powerful vested interests which stand to gain from the persistence of the existing, but outdated system of law and custom.&#8221; Jane Jacobs said much the same thing. The most important conflict in any society, she wrote at the end of <em>The Economy of Cities</em>, isn&#8217;t between the rich and poor or management and labor; it is between those who benefit from the status quo and those who benefit from change. If those who benefit from the status quo usually win, problems stack up unsolved.</p>

					<p>May I interrupt my usual posts to complain about something? Something minor?</p>
<p>It is that iTunes for Windows &#8212; from Apple, the maker of what are said to be brilliantly-designed products &#8212; is horribly designed. I have two examples.</p>
<p>1. Suppose I want to see what&#8217;s in the iTunes Store. I open a new window.<strong> I can&#8217;t close that window without closing iTunes!</strong> And if, after closing the whole program, I open it again, it still gives me the Stores window! Maybe the Stores window went away after a few weeks&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to even think about it.</p>
<p>2. I pressed the wrong button and started 181 downloads. <strong>There is no way to cancel them!</strong> If I stop the whole program, they will resume the next time I start it. This is software design from the 1960s.</p>
<p>And this is iTunes version 10.something, not version 0.3.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Last week, while looking at Google Voice I noticed a button that said &#8220;Get $10&#8243;. I thought it meant &#8220;get $10 credit for trying it&#8221; so I pushed the button. Ten dollars credit showed up. Since Google Voice is free for the calls I make I had no use for $10 credit but maybe someday&#8230;.</p>
<p>A few days later I happened to look at my credit card bill. <em>Google had billed me $10!</em> I didn&#8217;t even know they <strong>knew </strong>my credit card number! It hadn&#8217;t been required for the $10 transaction. I haven&#8217;t consciously used Google Checkout. I haven&#8217;t given it to them in any other connection. Talk about data mining&#8230;</p>
<p>When I go to Account Settings listed under my Gmail address, one of the sections is My Products, meaning My Google Products. Under that is listed Google Checkout, although I&#8217;ve never signed up for it and (I thought) never used it. So why is it there? I looked in Google Checkout. <strong>The Google Voice $10 transaction is the only transaction listed. </strong>As far as I can tell, this proves I didn&#8217;t use Google Checkout in the past (say, 4 months ago) and forget about it. Google really did get and use my credit card number without telling me, much less asking me.</p>
<p>My credit card company quickly gave me a refund.</p>

					<p>A year ago my gmail account was hacked. I recovered it in an hour or so, not before a friend of mine had <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2009/11/18/chatting-with-a-hacker/">an amusing conversation</a>. Recently, judging by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/04/hacking-epidemic-no-joke-lock-down-your-gmail-now/237375/">James Fallows&#8217;s experiences</a>, there has been a rise in these attacks. My mistake, I believe, was using the same password on my gmail account and another account. I suspect the recent outbreak of gmail break-ins is happening because there was recently a large exposure of passwords elsewhere.</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t be sure because I cannot compare break-ins over time. What does a graph of break-ins-versus-time look like? Is what Fallows has noticed a recent spike?  (It probably is.) If so, that supports my explanation of its cause (passwords lost elsewhere). Or has there been a steady increase over time? That would contradict my explanation. It is revealing that Fallows provides two security suggestions, one of them really time-consuming (two-stage verification) in the long haul. He says nothing about making sure your gmail password is not used anywhere else. If he could have seen that break-ins-versus-time graph, he could better judge whether the gmail hacks are due to duplicated passwords. If I am right about the cause of these hacks, Suggestion #3 should have been <strong><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2010/05/postpoints_tip_dont_recycle_pa.html">don&#8217;t use your gmail password anywhere else</a></strong> &#8212; and would have been the most effective.</p>
<p>Gmail developers can help all of us be safe at reasonable cost by publishing graphs that show break-ins (and probability of break-in) per day. I think that is estimated by the number of account recovery requests they receive per day. After my gmail account was hacked, I contacted Google to recover it and soon did. Perhaps those account recovery requests could involve the person making the request giving a reason (e.g., &#8220;account hijacked&#8221;). Then Google could simply tell us (with a graph?) the number of hijacked accounts reported per day.</p>
<p>Security departments and others don&#8217;t like to provide this sort of information. Persons at the top of companies worry <strong>it will scare customers!</strong> Those in security departments worry <strong>people will be less scared</strong> &#8212; thus reducing their power. From a user point of view these are horrible reasons not to make this information public. With accurate knowledge of the likelihood of break-ins, gmail users can make reasonable estimates of the costs and benefits of various security options. Without knowing the likelihood of break-ins, they can&#8217;t.</p>
