				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, a professor of decision science wrote me to say that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/09/vitamin-d3-in-morning-7000-iu-improves-sleep-story-21/" target="_blank">Vitamin D3 in the morning greatly improved his sleep</a>. Recently he wrote again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once again you have dramatically improved my life through your blog.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/15/assorted-links-283/" target="_blank">this Assorted Links post</a> you offered: </p>
<blockquote><p>The back pain of a friend of mine, which had lasted 20 years and was getting worse, went away when he followed <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsiedle/2012/11/28/how-americas-best-pain-doctor-took-on-the-medical-establishment-and-won/" target="_blank">this doctor&#8217;s advice</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I read the link about Dr. Sarno and went to Amazon to check out his book, &#8220;Healing Back Pain&#8221;. 700 reviews with a 4.5 star rating. I spent two hours reading the reviews. Person after person saying, &#8220;my back is better&#8221; and nobody really described what the book had them do. I bought it two weeks ago.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Sarno says that this type of back pain is caused by oxygen deprivation of some back muscles/tendons, and that the mind has does this as a defense mechanism so I don&#8217;t have to confront my subconscious anger.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have to pinpoint the source of my anger. I don&#8217;t have to come to grips with it and stop being angry. I just have to acknowledge the anger. That&#8217;s it. I read half the book in one sitting. I thought, this is crazy, but it has 700 4+ stars at Amazon. Maybe it does work.</p>
<p>My wife and I have two cars. One of them is a small Saturn. I hate it. It hurts my back to get in or out of it, and if I drive for more than five minutes I have to squirm to keep the back pain under control. Last week I took the Saturn for two half hour drives with only one wince of pain. Today I took it to the gym (a five minute drive) but it didn&#8217;t hurt to get in or out.</p>
<p>In the morning, to get out of bed, I have to roll over and swing my legs out toward the floor and then prop myself up into a sitting position. At least, that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve done it for the past year. This week, I just sat up in bed with no pain. Every morning.</p>
<p>I am still a bit weak in the lower back, after more than a year of restricted physical activity. But this is amazing.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/books/review/immortal-bird-doron-webers-lament-for-his-son.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Immortal Bird</a></em> by <a href="http://immortalbirdpostscript.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Doron Weber</a>, a program director at the Sloan Foundation, is about his son, Damon, who had a rare medical condition, and his son&#8217;s heart transplant operation (cost = $500,000) at New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Damon died after the operation. The post-operative care was so bad his father sued. &#8220;Three years into the lawsuit, the medical director [of the hospital] claimed Damon’s post-op records couldn’t be located,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/books/review/immortal-bird-doron-webers-lament-for-his-son.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">said the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>
<p>How can such tragedies be prevented? To find out, I interviewed Doron Weber by email.<span id="more-8627"></span></p>
<p><strong>SETH</strong> Let&#8217;s say someone lives in a different part of the country &#8212; Los Angeles, for instance. What would you tell them about picking doctors to do a difficult expensive operation?</p>
<p><strong>DORON</strong> I believe the key step before making any major medical decision is to gather as much information as possible. In my son&#8217;s case, we talked to everyone we knew at his regular New York hospital (New York Presbyterian) for their recommendation, and then we compared that information with experts at half a dozen other hospitals in New York and across the country who had a good reputation for his operation. I had established contacts at many of these hospitals, usually through physicians or scientists who I knew, either personally or professionally. But sometimes I would just get the name of a leading doctor and call him or her cold. They didn&#8217;t always respond but often they did, especially if you could make the case sound interesting. And I found that most doctors are very decent people who will try to share their knowledge, albeit succintly. I got the best results by being polite but determined and I didn&#8217;t require a long conversation&#8211;though some physicians were truly generous with their time&#8211;because in the end, you just want to know what they would do or who they would go see if it was their son or daughter.</p>
<p>I also traveled with my son to meet many of these experts at places like Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia, Boston Children&#8217;s, and the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. During my son&#8217;s long illness, I found 3-4 key advisers&#8211;medical people who I respected and trusted, who would take my calls (one was my cousin, another the friend of a friend), and who were willing to work with me as my son&#8217;s case developed. These wonderful physicians would not just give intelligent medical advice seasoned by experience but they would send me the latest medical journals and articles for any possible leads. And they would direct me to other experts. Good people tend to know other good people.</p>
<p>If there was one mistake I made, it was to rely too much on data and statistics&#8211;they do matter, and they worked to extend and enhance my son&#8217;s life for several years&#8211;and not to listen to my own instincts. The physician whom I consider responsible for my son&#8217;s death&#8211;and against whom I have a still-pending lawsuit&#8211;was someone whom I had a bad feeling about from the start. (See <em>Immortal Bird</em> for examples.) But she had a great reputation, everyone kept extolling her and her hospital had the best outcome data for my son&#8217;s operation. Also my son wanted to stay at that hospital. So I suppressed my doubts and reservations and made the correct statistical calculation but a disastrous human one.</p>
<p><strong>SETH</strong> What about screening doctors by asking about their legal record? For example, &#8220;Have you ever been sued for malpractice?&#8221; If so, going down the list of cases and learning about each one. And: &#8220;Have you ever been disciplined by a medical board?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>DORON</strong> Before my son&#8217;s wrongful death, despite all my information gathering, it never occurred to me to inquire about a physician&#8217;s legal record and whether he or she had ever been sued for malpractice. Now I know better. It would be very helpful to know if, and how many times, a physician has been sued before, even if it not definitive, because many doctors and hospital insurers settle out of court with strict confidentiality rules. But at least it gives you a preliminary context. And of course there are also frivolous lawsuits but if the same doctor was charged three times for the same alleged infraction, it is worth heeding. I have been most amazed at how many people, when I tell them about my medical lawsuit, describe how they or a loved one were horribly mistreated by a physician or hospital and came close to filing a lawsuit&#8211;but they didn&#8217;t go though with it because of the stress and the long, uphill battle and the years and expense involved. (Our own lawsuit has been active for six years but is on a contingency basis because we could not have afforded it otherwise.)  Almost everyone has a personal hospital horror story&#8211;if a conversation ever flags, just bring up this subject&#8211;but most people shy away from challenging the hospital and the doctors with their big reputations and deep pockets. I also found people who did not understand that they had been mistreated because it was too painful to confront and they preferred to accept the hospital&#8217;s misleading explanation. I think beyond a record of being sued, every physician should have to post a record of all patient histories, which minimally would include diagnosis, length and type of treatment, and outcome for each case. In no other field does the consumer have less information on which to base a decision, and yet in no other field are the stakes so high.</p>
<p><strong>SETH</strong> Based on your experience with your son, what are the first things we should change about our health care system?</p>
<p><strong>DORON</strong> For me the greatest problem with our health care system is that it is no longer about health care but about the health business. Many hospitals have been taken over by private equity firms while even the non-profits are under pressure to reduce costs at the expense of patient outcomes. So I think we have to find a way to return the patient to the center of the health care system and ensure that everything else revolves around his or her well-being. Efficiency and controlling costs matters but health care is not just another business and should not be run by business managers. I like the Mayo Clinic model where doctors are under salary so can take their time and not worry about insurance and where physicians at the same hospital consult with one another and take a more holistic, multidisciplinary approach. I also think continuity of care is absolutely critical and each patient needs one assigned physician who will take full responsibility and oversight for his/her care and be held accountable, regardless of how many specialists or other doctors the patient sees.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How does personal science (using science to solve a problem yourself rather than paying experts to solve it) compare to other sorts of DIY?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of personal science. When I became an assistant professor, I started to wake up too early in the morning. I didn&#8217;t consider seeing a doctor about it for several reasons: 1. Minor problem. Unpleasant but not painful. 2. Doctors usually prescribe drugs. I didn&#8217;t want to take a drug. 3. Sleep researchers, based on my reading of the sleep literature, had almost no idea what caused early awakening. They would have said it was due a bad phase shift of your circadian rhythm. They often used the term <strong>circadian phase disorder</strong> but never used the term <strong>circadian amplitude disorder</strong> &#8212; apparently they didn&#8217;t realize that such a thing was possible. I decided to try to solve the problem myself &#8212; an instance of DIY. Except that, if I made any progress,  that would be better than what the experts could provide, which I considered worthless.</p>
<p>There are thousands of instances of DIY, from fixing your car yourself to sewing your own clothes to word processing. Here is one dimension of DIY:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Quality of the final product</strong>. Better, equal, or worse to what you would get from professionals. Richard Bernstein&#8217;s introduction of home blood glucose testing led him to much better control of his blood glucose levels than his doctors had managed. Same as my situation: DIY produced acceptable results, the experts did not.</p>
<p>In contrast to Bernstein, who reduced his blood glucose variability within months, it took me years to improve my sleep.  That is another dimension:</p>
<p>2. <strong>Time needed</strong>. Personal science, compared to other DIY, is orders of magnitude slower.</p>
<p>Here are some more dimensions:</p>
<p>3. <strong>Training needed</strong>. I don&#8217;t know how much training personal science requires. On the face of it, not much. I had acne in high school. I could done self-experimentation at that point. It just didn&#8217;t occur to me. On the other hand, I think effective personal science requires wise narrowing of the possibilities that you test. For most health problems, you can find dozens of proposed remedies. How wise you need to be, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Commercialization</strong>. Some forms of DIY are entirely the creation of businesses &#8212; cheap cameras, home perms, IKEA, etc. Bernstein&#8217;s work happened because of a new product that required only a drop of blood. The company that made it wanted doctors to do DIY: measure blood glucose levels in their office (fast) rather than having the measurement made in a lab (slow).  When I started to study my sleep, no business was involved. Now, of course, companies like Zeo and the makers of FitBit want users to do personal science.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Price</strong>. My sleep research cost nothing, which in the DIY world is unusual. The term DIY is almost entirely a commercial category: Certain books and goods are sold to help you DIY.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Customization possible</strong>. Some kinds of DIY give you the tools to build one thing (e.g., IKEA, home perms). Other kinds (e.g., Home Depot, word processing) give you the tools to build a huge range of things. This dimension is variation in how close what you buy is to the finished product (Ikea = very close, word processing = very far). Personal science allows huge customization. It can adjust to any biology (e.g., your genome) and environment (your living conditions).</p>
<p>7. <strong>Benefit to society</strong>.  If I or anyone else can find new ways to sleep better &#8212; especially safe cheap easy ways &#8212; and these solutions can be spread, there is great benefit to society,  by comparison to DIY that allows non-professionals to reproduce what a professional would create (e.g, IKEA).</p>
<p>You might say that personal science isn&#8217;t really DIY because, compared to other DIY, (a) it is much slower and (b) the potential benefit to society is much greater. But those features are due to the nature of science. Any form of DIY has unique elements.</p>
<p>My mental picture of DIY is that there are two sides, producers and consumers, and in many domains (health, car maintenance, word processing, etc.) they creep toward each other in the sense that what producers can make slowly increases and what consumers are capable of slowly increases.  When they meet, DIY begins. In some cases, the business has done most of the changing; the DIY is very easy (e.g., Ikea).  In other cases, the consumer has changed a lot (literacy &#8212; not easy to acquire). Either way, the new DIY causes professionals who provided that service or good for a living to lose business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many years ago, when I was a professor at Berkeley, I sought out David Freedman, a professor of statistics, for comment on an idea of mine. I knew he would dislike it &#8212; he was negative about everything &#8212; and I wondered how strong his reasons for disliking it would be. It turned out, as I expected, that he disliked it but &#8212; I was glad to see &#8212; had no convincing reasons. That was helpful, I thought.</p>
<p>Likewise, it is obvious that the AMA would dislike <a href="https://www.healthtap.com/">HealthTap</a>, a website that solicits doctors&#8217; answers to medical questions (along the lines of &#8220;I have X symptoms. What should I do?&#8221;). <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/business/on-healthtap-advice-for-you-and-points-for-doctors.html?_r=1">Here&#8217;s</a> the AMA response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Peter W. Carmel, president of the American Medical Association, says he is concerned about the use of online medical information, which should “complement, not replace, the communication between a patient and their physician,” he wrote in an e-mail. With online health information sites, “a medical history is not taken, a physical exam does not occur and any suggested treatment is not monitored or assessed,” he said. “Using this information in isolation could pose a threat to patients.”</p></blockquote>
<p>These comments could have been made by someone with no medical training. Practically everything has a hypothetical downside (&#8220;could pose a threat&#8221;). Since he fails to call into question the obvious upside (patients will get questions answered much faster and cheaper), he is practically endorsing it.</p>
