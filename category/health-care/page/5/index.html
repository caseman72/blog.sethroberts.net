				<small>Friday, November 30th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/bad-pharma-by-ben-goldacre.html" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen</a> links to <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w18552#fromrss" target="_blank">a paper by Frank Lichtenberg</a>, an economist at Columbia University, that tries to estimate the benefits of drug company innovation by estimating how much new drugs prolong life compared to older drugs. The paper compares people equated in a variety of ways except the &#8220;vintage&#8221; (date of approval) of the drugs they take. <em>Does taking newer drugs increase life-span?</em> is the question Lichtenberg wants to answer. He concludes they do. He says his findings &#8220;suggest that two-thirds of the 0.6-year increase in the life expectancy of elderly Americans during 1996-2003 was due to the increase in drug vintage&#8221; &#8212; that is, to newer drugs.</p>
<p>An obvious problem is that Lichtenberg has not controlled for health-consciousness. This is <a href="http://geography.ssc.uwo.ca/faculty/baxter/readings/Taubes_limits_epidemiology_Science_1995.pdf" target="_blank">a standard epidemiological point</a>. People who adopt Conventional Healthy Behavior X (e.g., eat less fat) are more likely to adopt Conventional Healthy Behavior Y (e.g., find a better doctor) than those who don&#8217;t. For example, a study found that people who drink a proper amount of wine eat more vegetables. Another reason for a correlation between conventionally-healthy practices is mild depression. People who are mildly depressed are less likely to do twenty different helpful things (including &#8220;eat healthy&#8221; and &#8220;find a better doctor&#8221;) than people who are not mildly depressed. (And mild depression seems to be common.) Perhaps doctors differ. (Lichtenberg concludes there are big differences.) Perhaps better doctors (a) prescribe more recent drugs and (b) do other things that benefit their patients. Lichtenberg does not discuss these possibilities.</p>
<p>A subtle problem with Lichtenberg&#8217;s conclusion that we benefit from drug company innovation is that drug-company-like thinking &#8212; the notion that health problems should be &#8220;solved&#8221; with drugs &#8212; interferes with a better way of thinking: the notion that to solve a health problem, we should find out what aspects of the environment cause it. I suppose this is why we have Schools of Public Health &#8212; because this way of thinking, advocated at schools of public health, is so incompatible with what is said and done at medical schools. Public health thinking has a clear and impressive track record &#8212; for example, the disappearance of infectious disease as a major source of death. There are plenty of other examples: the drop in lung cancer after it was discovered that smoking causes lung cancer, the drop in birth defects after it was discovered that folate deficiency causes birth defects. Thinking centered on drugs has done nothing so helpful. Spending enormous amounts of money to develop new drugs shifts resources away from more cost-effective research: about environmental causes and prevention. Someone should ask the directors of the Susan K. Komen Foundation: Why &#8220;race for the cure&#8221;? Wouldn&#8217;t spending the money on prevention research save more lives?</p>

Based on my experience with Chandra, I believe Stapel&#8217;s colleagues had doubts but did nothing from some combination of careerism (doing something would have cost too much, for example  a lot of time, and gained them nothing), ignorance (not their field), and decency (they saw no great value in ruining someone).  I wonder if the report considered these other possible explanations (careerism, ignorance, decency).</li>

					<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/opinion/cancer-survivor-or-victim-of-overdiagnosis.html" target="_blank">A recent op-ed</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> by H. Gilbert Welch, a co-author of <em>Overdiagnosis</em>, describes a tragedy of ignorance and overconfidence. The current emphasis on regular mammograms began thirty years ago. They will prevent breast cancer, doctors and health experts told hundreds of millions of women. They will allow early detection of cancers that, if not caught early, would become life-threatening. The campaign was very successful. According to <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1206809#t=articleDiscussion" target="_blank">the paper cited by Welch</a>, about 70% of American women report getting such screening.</p>
<p>It is now abundantly clear this was a mistake. If screening worked perfectly &#8212; if all of the cancers it detected were dangerous &#8212; the rate of late-stage breast cancer should have gone down by the amount that the rate of early-stage breast cancer went up. Over the thirty years of screening, the rate of (detected) early-stage breast cancers among women over 40 doubled, no doubt because of  screening. (Over the same period the rate of early-stage breast cancers among women under 40 barely changed.) In spite of all this early detection and treatment, the rate of late-stage breast cancer among women over 40 stayed essentially the same. All that screening (billions of mammograms), all that chemo and surgery and radiation, all that worry and time and misery &#8212; and no clear benefit to the women screened and those who paid for the screening, treatment, and so on. Roughly all of the &#8220;cancers&#8221; detected by screening and then, at great cost, removed, aren&#8217;t dangerous, it turns out.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the staggering size of the mistake and the long time needed to notice it, screening has been promoted with specious logic.</p>
<blockquote><p>Proponents have used the most misleading screening statistic there is: survival rates. A recent <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/promise-action.html?ecid=vanityurl:121">Komen Foundation campaign</a> typifies the approach: “Early detection saves lives. The five-year survival rate for breast cancer when caught early is 98 percent. When it’s not? It decreases to 23 percent.” Survival rates always go up with early diagnosis: people who get a diagnosis earlier in life will live longer with their diagnosis, even if it doesn’t change their time of death by one iota.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did those making the 98% vs. 23% argument not understand this?</p>
<p>I applaud Welch&#8217;s research, but his op-ed has gaps. A unbiased assessment of breast cancer screening would include not only the (lack of) benefits but also the (full) costs. Treatment for a harmless &#8220;cancer&#8221; may cause worse health than no treatment. Maybe chemotherapy and radiation and surgery increase other cancers, for example. What about the effect of all those mammograms on overall cancer rate? Welch fails to consider this.</p>
<p>Welch also fails to make the most basic and important point of all. To reduce breast cancer, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=8276" target="_blank">it would be a good idea to learn what environmental factors cause it</a>. (For example, maybe <a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/20/1557.long" target="_blank">poor sleep causes breast cancer</a>.) Then it could be actually prevented. Much more cheaply and effectively.  Yet the Komen Foundation and the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation say &#8220;race for the cure&#8221; instead of trying to improve prevention.</p>

					<p>In Edward Jay Epstein&#8217;s new piece <a href="http://www.cjr.org/cover_story/gross_misunderstanding.php" target="_blank">Gross Misunderstanding</a>, in the <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em>, he writes</p>
<blockquote><p>By focusing on the box-office race that is spoon-fed to them each week, journalists may entertain their audiences, but they are missing the real story.</p></blockquote>
<p>Something similar happens with the Nobel Prizes. Journalists print what they are told &#8212; Scientists X and Y did beautiful &#8220;pure science&#8221; about this or that &#8212; and thereby miss the real story. In the case of Nobel Prizes in Medicine, the real story is the long-running lack of progress on major diseases (cancer, heart disease, depression, etc.).</p>

					<p>Jim Purdy, who often comments here, told me the following story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, a health professional ordered two tests for infectious bacteria in a small foot wound (I think the tests were for gram negative or gram positive bacteria, or maybe aerobic and anaerobic). Even before the bacterial tests came back, she wanted me to start on antibiotics. Instead I waited. The first results showed a very low level of a harmless bacteria, so I was glad I hadn&#8217;t started antibiotics.</p>
<p>When I saw her again, a few weeks later, I asked about the second set of bacterial tests. She claimed that there had only been one test, but I insisted she check again. She left, and came back a few minutes later and said that she had found the second results, and there had been no bacteria.</p></blockquote>
<p>Surely the health professional knew that antibiotics are overprescribed, that antibiotic resistant bacteria have become a serious problem, that antibiotics are dangerous, and yet she not only failed give the wound a chance to heal on its own, she failed to allow test results to guide what she did. No wonder she forgot about the second test.</p>

					<p>As <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/28/assorted-links-218/#comment-1042340" target="_blank">pointed out by dearime</a>, the columnist Peter Hitchens recently made <a href="http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2012/10/enter-a-church-and-you-should-hear-echoes-of-eternity-not-the-sugababes.html" target="_blank">the following comment</a> in <em>The Mail on Sunday</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I read in August that the talented Hollywood film director Tony Scott had killed himself without any apparent good reason, I was fairly sure that pretty soon we would find that the poor man had been taking ‘antidepressants’. Well, a preliminary autopsy has found ‘therapeutic’ levels of an ‘antidepressant’ in his system. I take no pleasure in being right, but as the scale of this scandal has become clear to me, I have learned to look out for the words ‘antidepressant’ or ‘being treated for depression’ in almost any case of suicide and violent, bizarre behavior. And I generally find it. The science behind these pills is extremely dubious. Their risks are only just beginning to emerge. It is time for an inquiry.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/10/tony-scott-autopsy-suicide-death" target="_blank">Tony Scott Suicide Remains a Mystery After Autopsy</a>,&#8221; wrote a <em>Vanity Fair</em> editor. The autopsy found that he had been taking the antidepressant Remeron, whose known side effects include suicide. SSRI&#8217;s, of which Remeron is an example, cause suicidal thinking in people who are not depressed.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist David Healy was the first to emphasize this point. In 2000, after he began this research, he was offered a job at the University of Toronto. In a very unusual move, <a href="http://www.pharmapolitics.com/" target="_blank">the job offer was rescinded</a>. Apparently psychiatry professors at the University of Toronto realized that Healy&#8217;s research made the psychiatric drug industry look bad.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s wrong to sell drugs that improve this or that condition (e.g., depression), even if the improvement is slight. I do think it&#8217;s wrong to make false claims to induce people to buy the drugs. In the case of depression, the false claim is that depression is due to a &#8220;chemical imbalance.&#8221; No chemical difference has ever been shown between people who later become depressed and people who don&#8217;t later become depressed. This claim, repeated endlessly, makes it harder to do research into what causes depression. If you figured out what caused depression, you could treat it and prevent it much better. This false claim does enormous damage. It delays by many years discovery of effective treatment and prevention of depression, a disease from which hundreds of millions of people now suffer.</p>
<p>This happens in dozens of areas of medicine. Dermatologists say &#8220;<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/19/doctor-logic-acne-is-caused-by-bacteria/">acne is caused by bacteria</a>&#8220;. Most doctors appear to believe &#8220;ulcers are caused by bacteria&#8221;. <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html" target="_blank">Ear nose and throat surgeons</a> claim that part of the immune system (the tonsils) causes illness. The &#8220;scale of the scandal&#8221; &#8212; medical school professors either (a) don&#8217;t understand causality or (b) deceive the rest of us &#8212; is great.</p>

					<p>Persons with Type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. They are usually overweight.

				<small>Friday, October 19th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Presumably Dr. Jenny Kim is a good dermatologist because the author of <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/10/15/162821580/doctors-strike-mutating-bacteria-in-teen-acne-battle" target="_blank">this NPR piece</a> chose to quote her:</p>
<blockquote><p>UCLA dermatologist Dr. <a href="http://www.uclahealth.org/body.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&amp;id=479&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=15746">Jenny Kim</a> says many people don&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s bacteria that cause acne. &#8220;Some people say your face is dirty, you need to clean it more, scrub more, don&#8217;t eat chocolate, things like that. But really, it&#8217;s caused by bacteria and the oil inside the pore allows the bacteria to overpopulate,&#8221; Kim says.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I were to ask Dr. Kim how she knows that acne is &#8220;caused by bacteria&#8221; I think she&#8217;d say &#8220;because when you kill the bacteria [with antibiotics] the acne goes away.&#8221;  Suppose I then asked: &#8220;Is there evidence that the bacteria of people who get acne differ from the bacteria of people who don&#8217;t get acne (before the acne)?&#8221; What I assume Dr. Kim would answer: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no such evidence, I&#8217;m sure. It is quite plausible that the bacteria of the two groups (with and without acne) are exactly the same, at least before acne. If it turned out, upon investigation, that the bacteria of people who get acne is the same as the bacteria of people who don&#8217;t get acne, that would make it much harder to say that acne is caused by bacteria. As far as I can tell, Dr. Kim and apparently all influential dermatologists have not thought even this deeply about it. To do so would be seriously inconvenient, because if acne isn&#8217;t caused by bacteria, it would be harder to justify prescribing antibiotics. Which dermatologists have been doing  for decades.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t just dermatologists. Many doctors believe that <em>H. pylori</em> causes ulcers &#8212; wasn&#8217;t a Nobel Prize given for discovering that? The evidence for that assertion consisted of: 1. <em>H. pylori </em>found at ulcers. 2. Doctor swallowed billions of <em>H. pylori </em> and <strong>didn&#8221;t get an ulcer</strong>. (Not a typo.) It was enough that he got indigestion or something. 3. Antibiotics cause ulcers to heal. That was enough for the two doctors who made the <em>H. pylori</em> case and the Nobel Prize committee they convinced. The doctors and the committee failed to know or understand that <em>H. pylori</em> infection is very common and almost no one who is infected gets an ulcer. Psychiatric causal reasoning has been even simpler and even more self-serving. We know that depression &#8212; a huge problem &#8212; is due to &#8220;a chemical imbalance&#8221;, according to many psychiatrists, because (a) antidepressants work (not very well) and (b) antidepressants change brain chemistry.</p>
<p>Dr. Kim&#8217;s false certainty matters because I&#8217;m sure most people with acne don&#8217;t know what causes it. I didn&#8217;t. Dr. Kim&#8217;s false certainty and similar statements from other dermatologists make it harder for them to find out.  I wrote about <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/09/make-yourself-healthy-searchi.html" target="_blank">a woman who figured out what caused her acne</a>. It wasn&#8217;t easy or obvious.</p>

					<p>As usual, there is plenty of disease and disability in the world: depression, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke, obesity, autoimmune disease, and so on. As usual, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &#8212; supposed to be given for the most useful research &#8212; is given for research with no proven benefit to anyone (except career-wise). Once again implying that the world&#8217;s best biomedical researchers &#8212; judging by who wins Nobel Prizes &#8212; either don&#8217;t want to or don&#8217;t know how to do useful research.</p>
<p>Once again <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/press.html">the press release</a> tries to hide this. &#8220;From surprising discovery to medical use&#8221; reads one heading. If you read the text, however, you learn there is no actual &#8220;medical use&#8221;. Here&#8217;s what it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>These discoveries have also provided new tools for scientists around the world and led to remarkable progress in many areas of medicine. iPS cells can also be prepared from human cells. For instance, skin cells can be obtained from patients with various diseases, reprogrammed, and examined in the laboratory to determine how they differ from cells of healthy individuals. Such cells constitute invaluable tools for understanding disease mechanisms and so provide new opportunities to develop medical therapies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently you can make &#8220;remarkable progress&#8221; in medicine without helping a single person, which says a lot about what passes for medical progress. Although iPS cells are supposedly &#8220;invaluable tools&#8221; for understanding disease mechanisms, we are not told a single disease that has thereby been understood or a single therapy that has been developed.</p>
<p><em>The Guardian</em> printed <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/oct/08/nobel-prize-2012-live-medicine-physiology">a roundup of responses</a> to the award. I read it eagerly. Maybe one of the comments will explain how the prize-winning work actually helped someone (besides career-wise). After all, Yamanaka, one of the winners, had previously won the Finland Prize, given to research that &#8220;significantly improves the quality of human life today and for future generations&#8221;. Paul Nurse says the prize-winning work did such-and-such, &#8220;paving the way for important developments in the diagnosis and treatment of disease&#8221; unfortunately not saying what those &#8220;important developments&#8221; are. Martin Evans says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The practical outcome is that now we not only know that it might be theoretically possible to convert one cell type into another but it is also practically possible. These are very important foundation studies for <strong>future</strong> cellular therapies in medicine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added. Another comment: &#8220;These breakthroughs <strong>will</strong> ultimately lead to new and better treatments for conditions like Parkinson’s and improve the lives of millions of people around the world.&#8221; A bold prediction, given that they have not yet improved the life of even one person. Julian Savescu, an ethicist at Oxford, says &#8220;This is as significant as the discovery of antibiotics. Given the millions, or more lives, which could be saved, this is a truly momentous award.&#8221;</p>
<p>Year after year, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is given for research that, we are told by biologists with huge conflicts of interest, will &#8212; no doubt! &#8212; be incredibly valuable in the future. Indicating there was no research that might be honored that had already been useful. It is as if you have a baseball award for best hitter but all hitters all over the world strike out all the time so you end up giving the award to people who strike out best. <em>They are the best hitters</em>, you tell credulous sportswriters. They receive the prestigious award for best hitter at an elaborate ceremony, with toasts all around. Nobody says they cannot hit.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, October 9th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In 2009, a British rheumatologist named Andrew Banji wrote about the hidden side effects of statins <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1128333/Viewpoint-The-hidden-painful-cost-statins.html">in the</a> <em>Daily Mail</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I discovered the link between statins and rheumatic side-effects quite by chance. My attack of tendon inflammation occurred at the front of my shin &#8211; a highly unusual place for tenosynovitis &#8211; so I decided to do some research into what could have triggered this. I was amazed to discover the only other related case was linked to a patient on statins.</p>
<p>Following a high cholesterol-reading of 9.2 a couple of months before, I&#8217;d been put on the drug. Intrigued by the connection, I decided to stop taking my statin to see what happened. Within a couple of weeks, the pain had gone.</p>
<p>I went back to my GP and, over successive months, tried various statins, including rosuvastatin which is one that is often prescribed.</p>
<p>Each form of the drug caused terrible problems, including night cramp, muscle pain, severe muscle disorders known as myopathy and general fatigue. In fact, I became so tired I couldn&#8217;t lift anything when I was gardening or even walk the half-mile from my home to the center of town.</p>
<p>Yet whenever I halted the medication, my symptoms disappeared within a few weeks. . . .</p>
<p>I began to realize many of my patients with musculoskeletal conditions such as polymyalgia &#8211; pain, stiffness, and tenderness in the muscles &#8211; were on statins. When I advised them to stop taking their medication, their problems went away.\</p></blockquote>
<p>By 2009, statins were perhaps <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/01/20/335643">the most heavily prescribed drugs ever</a>, making tens of billions of dollars for drug companies. Yet this story shows that at that point <strong>a doctor who was taking statins</strong> was not yet aware of major common side effects. How convenient for drug companies. The story also shows that patients with a variety of muscular problems had to be told by a doctor to stop taking their statins to find out if the statins were causing the problem. That should have been common sense. On a more positive note, this story shows how easily some health problems can be fixed (&#8220;when I advised them to stop taking their medicaiton, their problems went away&#8221;).</p>

					<p>I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/03/unaccountable-by-marty-makary-2/">recently posted</a> about <em>Unaccountable</em> by Mart Makary, a book about the bad behavior of doctors. One of his points is &#8220;The when-you’re-a-hammer problem plagues modern medicine at every level.” He illustrated this with a case where transplant surgeons said an otherwise-healthy person with a small liver tumor should get a liver transplant. Which struck Makary as ridiculous.</p>
<p>A lawyer who reads this blog sees the same thing in lawyers. He told me the following story:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>One of the sixteen defendants we sued moved to transfer the venue of our case from [Southern California city] to [Northern California city]. Both plaintiffs, all of his doctors (over a dozen), all of the witnesses (again, about a dozen), and all of locations where the incident took place are in or near [N. California city]. When we got the motion I took it to my boss who said, &#8220;Huh. We should&#8217;ve filed it in [N. California city] to begin with. I don&#8217;t know why we didn&#8217;t.&#8221; It would&#8217;ve been inconvenient for us, b/c we&#8217;re in [S. California city], but we&#8217;ve filed cases up there before, so we could handle it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, did we stipulate with the defendant and just transfer the case up north? No. We filed a pathetic, perfunctory opposition. We had an argument, but it was very weak: one of the defendants was located in [S. California city]. That&#8217;s basically all we had to hang our hat on.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We filed our opposition, defendant filed their reply. We all trekked down to court to argue our positions in front of the judge. The hearing should&#8217;ve taken 30 seconds &#8211; &#8220;Defendant&#8217;s motion granted.&#8221; &#8212; but the judge actually entertained oral argument. Finally, he granted the motion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When I got back to the office, I noted to my secretary what a huge waste of time all of this was. The law was clear, virtually all of the facts were on opposing counsel&#8217;s side, we should&#8217;ve filed up north to begin with, so why fight it? Why not save everyone &#8212; us, opposing counsel, the judge and his staff &#8212; time and just agree? &#8220;Well, you gotta take a shot,&#8221; was her reply. Which is what I hear from attorneys all the time. &#8220;You gotta try, you gotta make the argument.&#8221; In other words, we have hammers so the hammers must be used no matter what.</div>
<p>No, it isn&#8217;t quite like a transplant surgeon who says a new liver is needed b/c of a small tumor &#8211; no one&#8217;s life or health is at risk &#8212; but how much time and resources are wasted in the legal system on bullshit like this?</p></blockquote>

					<p>The gist of <em>Unaccountable: What Hospitals Won&#8217;t Tell You &#8212; and How Transparency Can Revolutionize Health Care</em> (copy sent me by publisher) by Mart Makary, a med school professor at Johns Hopkins, is that doctors have failed to regulate themselves. Nobody else regulates them, so they are unaccountable. In many ways, Makary shows, bad behavior (e.g., unnecessary treatment, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/tonsillectomy-confidential-do.html">understating the risks of treatment</a>) is common. Hospitals hide how bad things are. Makary mostly discusses surgeons &#8212; he&#8217;s a surgeon &#8212; but gives plenty of reasons to think other specialties are no better.</p>
<p>The book is one horror story after another. At one point, Makary quit medical school. He was disgusted and appalled by seeing doctors &#8212; his teachers &#8212; push an old woman to consent to an operation she didn&#8217;t want and didn&#8217;t need. She refused, again and again, but the doctors kept pushing. Makary objected. He was ignored. Finally she agreed. The operation killed her. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/10/03/unaccountable-by-marty-makary-2/#more-7706" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>The not-yet-released book <a href="www.amazon.com/dp/16081983677"><em>Unaccountable: What Hospitals Won&#8217;t Tell You and How Transparency Can Revolutionize Health Care</em></a> by Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins, may or may not make good arguments &#8212; I haven&#8217;t read it &#8212; but it certainly begins with a good story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Harvard surgeon Dr. Luctan Leape at a national surgeon&#8217;s conference . . . opened the gathering&#8217;s keynote speech by looking out over the audience of thousands and asking the doctors to &#8220;raise your hand if you know of a physician that you work with who should not be practicing because he or she is dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every hand went up.</p></blockquote>
<p>The author, Marty Makary, asked the same question at his talks and got the same response. Both of them &#8212; Leape and Makary &#8212; should have started asking &#8220;What fraction of the surgeons you work with are unfit to practice?&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder how the rest of us can identify those unfit-to-practice surgeons. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/16/dr-eileen-consorti-and-patient-power/">My experience</a> has taught me not to trust a surgeon who says I need surgery.</p>
