				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I skype-chatted with <a href="http://clarissawei.com/" target="_blank">Clarissa Wei</a>, a Chinese-American journalist in Los Angeles whose <a href="http://clarissawei.com/2013/07/22/4-ways-to-enjoy-stinky-tofu-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank">post about stinky tofu in Los Angeles</a> impressed me.</p>
<p>SR What do you think of Chinese restaurants in America compared to Chinese restaurants in China?</p>
<p>CW It depends on where you&#8217;re talking about. In broad America, the Chinese food is pretty different from that of China. In places like Los Angeles and pockets of New York… it&#8217;s much more alike</p>
<p>SR I&#8217;m thinking of the best ones in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>CW It&#8217;s definitely cleaner here that&#8217;s for sure. In Los Angeles, the food quality is pretty similar. The major difference would be the price and variety. The selections are also pretty similar. The set-up in American Chinese restaurants is obviously different than the ones in China so that influences things a lot</p>
<p>SR I have never been to a Chinese restaurant in America that resembles a high-end Chinese restaurant in Beijing</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW In Los Angeles &#8212; there are a couple high-end Canto restaurants. </span>They typically are your seafood + dim sum banquet types. Lunasia is a great example.</p>
<p>SR What do you mean by the set up?</p>
<p>CW Well in China, a lot of the restaurants are literally hole-in-the-walls. There isn&#8217;t that much of a standard in terms of being neat and sanitary.</p>
<p>SR There is vastly more range in China, both better and worse</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW In the rural countrysides, it&#8217;s out of people&#8217;s homes. </span>But in America, everyone has to have at least some degree of sanitation.</p>
<p>SR Chinese restaurants in China are more playful. Like a toilet restaurant, for example.<span id="more-11044"></span></p>
<p>CW Very true. Yeah they&#8217;re opening one of those in LA.</p>
<p>SR Or a restaurant where everyone says hello when you enter and goodbye when you leave</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW There&#8217;s also a Taiwanese &#8220;Hooters&#8221; in L.A. A</span> lot of the Taiwanese breakfast eateries in L.A. have that &#8220;cutesy&#8221; vibe.</p>
<p>SR When you were in China were you in any way disappointed by the Chinese restaurants?</p>
<p>CW I was in China in 2011 for 4 months as part of a study abroad program. I was disappointed mostly because I always got sick.</p>
<p>SR  What city?</p>
<p>CW Shanghai. But I travelled to Guilin, Dunhuang, Beijing. I got sick from just the regular restaurants on my street. Some were marketed as higher-end. I lost 10 pounds from throwing up. Mind you, I go to Taiwan yearly and that never happens.</p>
<p>SR The first time I went to China I was sick every 2 days, but after that I was fine.</p>
<p>CW I think my toleration for bacteria is pretty low.</p>
<p>SR I get sick no more often in Beijing than in Berkeley. [But in Beijing I eat Korean and Japanese food mostly.]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW </span> That&#8217;s surprising. I was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donghuamen_Night_Market" target="_blank">Donghuamen</a> [a night market selling strange food] in Beijing. Did an article on that place. But I just felt like throwing up because the streets reeked of trash.</p>
<p>SR The cheap restaurants scare me. They use recycled cooking oil.</p>
<p>CW I think that&#8217;s changing now with the media coverage on the Chinese food scandals. But in places like Los Angeles..the food is pretty up to par in terms of &#8220;authenticity&#8221;.</p>
<p>SR How was the food in the various Chinese cities besides Shanghai?</p>
<p>CW It was alright. I get turned off when a restaurant is dirty to be honest. But that may just be because of my American upbringing. It really influences how I consume the food and how much I eat of it. <span style="font-size: 13px;">When I was in Dunhuang, there was a vendor making daoxiaomian but he kept on coughing over and over. And we watched him make the dish and serve it to us. I felt disgusted but we were starving.</span></p>
<p>SR What did you think of the food expertise of the Chinese people you met in China?</p>
<p>CW I learned a lot about Chinese food in China from my Chinese teacher. That&#8217;s when I started to gain in interest in the regional differences. <span style="font-size: 13px;">The oyster omelette for example in Xiamen is similar to the one in Taiwan, but crispier and thinner</span></p>
<p>SR It was very hard to buy a kitchen timer in Beijing because I was told no one uses them when they cook.</p>
<p>CW No one uses fancy gadgets or exact measurements there. It&#8217;s all passed down and family recipes which is the beauty of it.</p>
<p>SR My students at Tsinghua are more connoisseurs of food than my Berkeley students. A lot more.</p>
<p>CW Food is such a central theme of the Chinese culture. There&#8217;s a fascination with Western food too. In Shanghai, my first article for CNN was &#8220;Top Western Restaurants in Shanghai&#8221;. I brought my Shanghainese friends along to one of the places &#8212; a bagel places &#8212; and they were fascinated.</p>
<p>SR I went to the best Korean restaurant I&#8217;ve been to outside Korea in Shanghai.</p>
<p>CW Shanghai has a tradition of really embracing foreign cooking traditions. One of the best fine dining restaurants I&#8217;ve been to was in Shanghai, Mr. and Mrs. Bund.</p>
<p>SR Do people in Shanghai understand how good the food is in Japan?</p>
<p>CW I think so. But a lot of Chinese people really don&#8217;t have the opportunity to travel abroad. They don&#8217;t have a feel or the exposure to foreign tastes as much as Americans do. In Taiwan, there&#8217;s a fascination with the Japanese. Obviously because of the occupation of the Japanese but a lot of the high-end Taiwanese restos are Japanese influenced.</p>
<p>SR Controlling for age who did you think are the more adventurous eaters, Americans or Chinese &#8212; I mean the ones you know.</p>
<p>CW Chinese hands down.</p>
<p>SR That&#8217;s interesting, I always worry that my students won&#8217;t like this or that. [At least, they draw the line at eating insects.]</p>
<p>CW Just because Chinese cuisine has a variety of meats and offal and &#8220;bizarre&#8221; parts you know. So they&#8217;re much more open to try …. snails from France than your average American. Because snails are a Chinese dish too.<br />
Also in Chinese culture, you&#8217;re taught to eat anything and everything that&#8217;s presented to you. It&#8217;s rude to refuse.</p>
<p>SR A friend of mine said that Chinese (in practice) is a language of verbs, English is a language of nouns. One of the verbs is &#8220;eat&#8221;. Parents tell children: &#8220;eat&#8221;.</p>
<p>CW Yes. Americans have the luxury of being more picky &#8212; look at the whole gluten free, vegan movement in these metropolitan places. If you go into a Chinese restaurant in China and say you&#8217;re vegetarian &#8212; they don&#8217;t really know how to work with you. Some places will just roll their eyes.</p>
<p>SR After you came back from Shanghai to Los Angeles, how did you view American Chinese restaurants differently? The authentic ones.</p>
<p>CW I appreciated it a lot more. The food here is good and it won&#8217;t give me food poisoning. Sanitation was like the biggest worry in China. An article recently came out that said the ice from the KFC in China had more bacteria than toilet water.</p>
<p>SR  I never go to KFC in China. Now I have been vindicated in that decision</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">CW The egg tarts there are fantastic. Modeled after the original Macau egg tart recipe apparently. </span></p>
<p>SR There should be a category: best food in worst restaurant. Also worst food in best restaurant.</p>
<p>CW Chinese restaurants have such extensive menus, it&#8217;s always easy to find a bad item.</p>
<p>SR I was impressed that Chinese restaurants managed to make mashed potatoes slightly interesting. That&#8217;s baby food! They added raspberry sauce.</p>
<p>CW Again &#8212; fascination with Western food.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Tsinghua University, the Second Annual Chinese International Conference on Positive Psychology has just begun. The first speaker was Martin Seligman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and former president of the American Psychological Association (the main professional group of American psychologists). Seligman is more responsible for the Positive Psychology movement than anyone else. Here are some things I liked and disliked about his talk.</p>
<p>Likes:</p>
<p>1. Countries, such as England, have started to measure well-being in big frequent surveys (e.g., 2000 people every month) and some politicians, such as David Cameron, have vowed to increase well-being as measured by these surveys. This is a vast improvement over trying to increase how much money people make. The more common and popular and publicized this assessment becomes &#8212; this went unsaid &#8212; the more powerful psychologists will become, at the expense of economists. Seligman showed a measure of well-being for several European countries. Denmark was highest, Portugal lowest. His next slide showed the overall result of the same survey for China: 11.83%. However, by then I had forgotten the numerical scores on the preceding graph so I couldn&#8217;t say where this score put China.</p>
<p>2. Work by Angela Duckworth, another Penn professor, shows that &#8220;GRIT&#8221; (which means something like perseverance) is a much better predictor of school success than IQ. This work was mentioned in only one slide so I can&#8217;t elaborate. I had already heard about this work from Paul Tough in a talk about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/books/review/how-children-succeed-by-paul-tough.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">his new book</a>.</p>
<p>3. Teaching school children something about positive psychology (it was unclear what) raised their grades a bit.</p>
<p>Dislikes:</p>
<p>1. Three years ago, Seligman got $125 million from the US Army to reduce suicides, depression, etc. (At the birth of the positive psychology movement, Seligman proclaimed that psychologists spent too much time studying suicide, depression, etc.) I don&#8217;t mind the grant. What bothered me was a slide used to illustrate the results of an experiment. I couldn&#8217;t understand it. The experiment seems to have had two groups. The results from each group appeared to be on different graphs (making comparison difficult, of course).</p>
<p>2. Why does a measure of well-being not include health? This wasn&#8217;t explained.</p>
<p>3. Seligman said that a person&#8217;s level of happiness was &#8220;genetically determined&#8221; and therefore was difficult or impossible to change. (He put his own happiness in &#8220;the bottom 50%&#8221;.) Good grief. I&#8217;ve blogged several times about how the fact that something is &#8220;genetically-determined&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean it cannot be profoundly changed by the environment. Quite a misunderstanding by an APA president and Penn professor.</p>
<p>4. He mentioned a few studies that showed optimism (or lack of it) was a risk factor for heart disease after you adjust for the traditional risk factors (smoking, exercise, etc.). There is a whole school of &#8220;social epidemiology&#8221; that has shown the importance of stuff like where you are in the social hierarchy for heart disease. It&#8217;s at least 30 years old. Seligman appeared unaware of this. If you&#8217;re going to talk about heart disease epidemiology and claim to find new risk factors, at least know the basics.</p>
<p>5. Seligman said that China had &#8220;a good safety net.&#8221; People in China save a large fraction of their income at least partly because they are afraid of catastrophic medical costs. Poor people in China, when they get seriously sick, come to Beijing or Shanghai for treatment, perhaps because they don&#8217;t trust their local doctor (or the local doctor&#8217;s treatment failed). In Beijing or Shanghai, they are forced to pay enormous sums (e.g., half their life&#8217;s savings) for treatment. That&#8217;s the opposite of a good safety net.</p>
<p>6. Given the attention and resources and age of the Positive Psychology movement, the talk seemed short on new ways to make people better off. There was an experiment with school children where the main point appeared to be their grades improved a bit. A measure of how they treat each other also improved a bit. (Marilyn Watson, the wife of a Berkeley psychology professor, was doing a study about getting school kids to treat each other better long before the Positive Psychology movement.) There was an experiment with the U.S. Army I couldn&#8217;t understand. That&#8217;s it, in a 90-minute talk. At the beginning of his talk Seligman said he was going to tell us things &#8220;your grandmother didn&#8217;t know.&#8221; I can&#8217;t say he did that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because Tyler Cowen is going to Beijing, I made a list of suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Don&#8217;t go to the Great Wall. It&#8217;s a long drive. I preferred to see it on the Today Show. The only interesting bit was a guy who sat in a chair on the path to the wall and charged 30 cents to go further. We paid the 30 cents  but in retrospect I wish we hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>2. Visit some of the many &#8220;markets&#8221; that consist of a building full of tiny booths. There are markets devoted to cameras, jewelry, clothes, electronics, furniture, etc. There can be more choice of furniture in one building (say, 100 manufacturers) than exists in the entire Bay Area. Along similar lines there is a whole neighborhood full of tea sellers &#8212; if you like tea.</p>
<p>3. Peking duck is a good dish but I cannot tell the difference between the better restaurants serving it. So don&#8217;t go out of your way to go to an especially good place. I usually go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanjude">Quanjude</a> which has a branch very near my school (Tsinghua).</p>
<p>4.<a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294212-d1204537-Reviews-Middle_8th-Beijing.html"> Middle 8</a> is a very good restaurant (in Haidian and Chao Yang).</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Din_Tai_Fung">Din Tai Fung</a> is a  very good dumpling restaurant. It is a big international Taiwanese chain. So it isn&#8217;t even mainland Chinese food exactly.</p>
<p>6. There are grilled chicken wing restaurants near the west gates of both Peking University and Tsinghua University. I don&#8217;t know their names but they are very good. Popular with students.</p>
<p>7. I have never found a nice place in Beijing to walk. Even in parks there is a lack of shade.</p>
<p>8. In my neighborhood (Wudaokou) there are excellent Korean restaurants.</p>
<p>Feel free to leave your suggestions in the comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long after the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese">Kitty Genovese story</a> &#8212; supposedly many people watched her being murdered without doing anything &#8212; doubt was cast on its accuracy. In the meantime, John Darley and  Bibb Latane, two professors of psychology, it as the starting point for a series of experiments on what they called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect">the bystander effect</a> &#8212; the more bystanders, the less likely that each one will help. They concluded there was &#8220;diffusion of responsibility&#8221; &#8212; the more people that witness something, the less each witness feels responsible for doing something.</p>
<p>In China the problem is much worse. A few years ago a woman was hit by a car. A second car stopped to help her. The woman told the police that the second driver had hit her. The second driver was furious, gave many interviews, and eventually a witness was found who said it was the driver, not the injured woman, who was telling the truth. Someone I spoke to attributed her behavior to the need to pay hospital bills. The driver who hit her would never be caught, she reasoned. Maybe the second driver could be forced to pay.</p>
<p>My Chinese tutor, who is Korean, told me a story that illustrates the depth of Chinese bystander inaction and suggests another reason for it. A friend of hers was visiting from Korea. When this friend was in Wangjing (in the Chaoyang district of Beijing), she saw a person lying on a busy street, bleeding but still alive. Apparently the bleeding person had been hit by a car. Three hours later, the friend returned &#8212; and the accident victim was still there! Now dead. So, with difficulty &#8212; she doesn&#8217;t speak Chinese &#8212; she called the police.</p>
<p><strong>The police treated her as a suspect.</strong> She was forced to come to the police station five times, for hours each time.</p>
<p>What a deterrent to calling the police! I cannot believe the police were so stupid as to consider a Korean tourist on foot who calls the police a serious suspect in the death of someone lying in the middle of traffic. I believe that by causing her a lot of trouble, they wanted to send a message: <strong>Leave us alone</strong>. The fewer calls they get, the less work they have to do. No wonder everyone ignored the bleeding victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I am scaring you,&#8221; said my Chinese teacher. &#8220;You are,&#8221; I said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I heard Gary Shteyngart (latest book <a href="http://supersadtruelovestory.com/"><em>Super Sad True Love Story</em></a>) at the Beijing Bookworm. No better job of authorial self-promotion have I seen. He was born in Leningrad in 1972, he grew up hearing jokes from his parents. For example: The 1980 Summer Olympics were in Moscow. At the time, Brezhnev was in charge. He was going senile. At an Olympic ceremony,  he gave a speech. His hands shook holding the text of his talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohhhhhh&#8230;..&#8221; he read.</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohhhhh&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohhhhh&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>An apparatchik ran up to him. &#8220;Senior Comrade Brezhnev, those are the Olympic Rings!&#8221;</p>
<p>The moderator asked Shteyngart what he thought of Putin&#8217;s plan to require every Russian teenager to read a specified 100 great books by graduation. &#8220;These things never work,&#8221; said Shteyngart. &#8220;American cities have done this. Everyone&#8217;s supposed to read a certain book, usually <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. Never tell someone what to read.&#8221; However, he said one of his favorite authors is Karen Russell. (For a <em>New Yorker</em> podcast, he read a story by Andrea Lee.)</p>
<p>I asked about his favorite TV shows. He mentioned <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>The Wire</em>, and <em>Breaking Bad</em>. &#8220;Who would have guessed that TV would become a great art form?&#8221; He is writing a show for HBO about Brooklyn immigrants.</p>
<p>I learned that he was <a href="http://www.drunkard.com/issues/06_06/06_06_gary_shteyngart.html">interviewed</a> by a magazine called <a href="http://www.drunkard.com"><em>Modern Drunkard</em></a>. The interviewer &#8212; not Shteyngart &#8212; mentions an Russian saying: &#8220;The church is near, but the road is icy. The bar is far away, but I will walk carefully.” How true.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/08/the-willat-effect-side-by-side-comparisons-create-connoisseurs/">The Willat Effect</a> is the hedonic change produced by side-by-side comparisons of similar products &#8212; for example, two green teas. It happens in seconds: Suddenly the differences matter more. Some versions become more pleasant, other versions less pleasant.  I first noticed it with limoncello that my friend Carl Willat offered me. Here are some reactions to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/">my recent post about it</a>: <span id="more-4254"></span></p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/n/?benfischler%2Fposts%2F261755930527999&amp;mid=507e1ddG209d0c13G867c26aG5b&amp;bcode=VkghKG9i&amp;n_m=carl%40carlsfinefilms.com">A Facebook comment</a> from a friend of Carl&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>I too can confirm the existence of The Willat Effect. Example: I&#8217;ll look at a coat that feels and looks great, see the price and say I can&#8217;t afford this. Then I&#8217;ll try another on and it&#8217;s close to the first but not quite but it&#8217;s also 300 dollars less. I opt for the first, spending more. Carl&#8217;s taught me to never settle for second best. And he doesn&#8217;t make a bad limoncello either.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes to both. I recently went bike shopping in Beijing. I asked a Chinese friend who makes the best bikes: Giant, she said. A Taiwanese company. I found a Giant store. I chose the model I wanted. I test-drove it. Fine, except the seat was too short. This could not be fixed, they said. I didn&#8217;t like any other Giant model. I would have to buy a different make of bike. There were other bike stores nearby, all with cheaper bikes. (Giant bikes cost about 40% more than the next most costly.) I tested a few. The cheaper bikes were clearly worse than the Giant bike: less smooth ride. Too bad for me. I chose one to buy. The problem of too-short seat remained, but the seller said he could fix it. He brought out a longer neck that could be attached to a seat. I bought the longer neck, took it to the Giant store, and got my first-choice bike. I am especially pleased how smoothly it rides. In the Giant store (franchise), there was no bargaining &#8212; the sticker price was the actual price &#8212; and the employees were standoffish. In the other stores (non-franchise), you could bargain and the employees were friendly. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/benjamin_wallace_on_the_price_of_happiness.html">This talk</a> mentions the very smooth ride of a very expensive car.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/18/the-willat-effect-hedonic-change-caused-by-side-by-side-comparison-of-similar-things.html">A Boing Boing post about this</a> linked to <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/18/iphone-4s-vs-canon-5d-mkii-video-comparison-side-by-side.html#disqus_thread">a side-by-side comparison of expensive cameras</a> &#8212; that is, a side-by-side comparison of the pictures they take. As <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/#comment-928600">David Scrimshaw commented</a>, this sh** is dangerous. It could make me dissatisfied with what was previously (and in other ways still is) perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>3. I compared black tea steeped for 3 minutes with the same tea steeped for 5 minutes. I tasted them side by side. I have been drinking black tea for 10 years. For the first time I noticed that the 5-minute tea had a strong bitter note unnoticeable in the 3-minute tea. People had told me that if you steep black tea too long it becomes bitter. I thought they meant if you steep it for 8 minutes it becomes bitter. I routinely steeped black tea 5 minutes. I told someone about this and he said <em>rinse the tea first</em>. This made no sense (experienced tea drinkers rinse certain green teas, not black teas) but I tried it. I found that ten seconds of rinsing (add water, wait 10 seconds, discard water) didn&#8217;t eliminate the bitterness. There was no clear difference between rinsed and unrinsed tea.</p>
<p>4. I agree with commenters who said I should taste my tea &#8220;blind&#8221; &#8212; not knowing the price. That&#8217;s a good idea. During a tea-tasting tour of Beijing (which did not include side-by-side comparisons of similar teas and had little effect on my green tea consumption), I learned that at the wholesale level green tea leaves are priced lot by lot. The buyer tastes tea made from the tea leaves for sale and offers a price. If I notice a correlation for green tea between cost and how much I like it, it presumably reflects this earlier process.  As far as I can tell in Beijing there is no advertising for different varieties of green tea. Tea stores usually sell it in bulk in identical bins. No packaging, no boasts or claims.</p>
<p>5. Does the effect happen <strong>because</strong> I knew the teas cost different prices? I doubt it. During the first example, with limoncello, I had no idea of the prices. The homemade limoncellos, which were not identified, had no price. I have noticed the effect <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/09/my-theory-of-human-evolution-american-idol-edition/">with YouTube videos</a> (different covers of one song), which are free. I have done side-by-side tastings of cheeses, wines, etc., that varied greatly in price countless times. No Willat Effect, presumably because they weren&#8217;t similar enough (e.g., the two wines came from different lines of grapes). But I agree it would be nice to eliminate the effect of price differences.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/#comment-928788">Wangston commented</a>: &#8220;More expensive things taste better because rarity is delicious.&#8221;  There is certainly pressure to say expensive things taste better. You/we are supposed to think that. Millions of advertisers would like us to think that. Surely the phrase <em>the finer things in life</em> came from an ad. Maybe ads are where the pressure comes from. In my experience, without side-by-side comparisons more expensive things usually do not taste better.  For example, I have never done side-by-side comparisons of wine. And  expensive wines ($30/bottle) taste no better than much cheaper wines ($10/bottle). Before I did side-by-side cheese tastings, $30/pound cheese tasted no better than $10/pound cheese. After side-by-side cheese tastings, only then did I notice and care about the difference. I started to pay much more for cheese. I wish I could make the cheap stuff taste better but every time (tea, cheese, orange marmalade, sake) the expensive stuff turns out to be what tastes better. Contradicting the &#8220;rational actor&#8221; assumption of economists.</p>
<p>7. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/#comment-928626">Robin Barooah commented</a> that with experience you form a mental map of the product space. He is &#8220;something of a coffee connoisseur&#8221; and has a mental map of the coffee space. This has allowed him to enjoy less-than-the-best coffees because they have their place and he enjoys brewing them in different ways.  My limited experience entirely supports this. I have never gone far with these close comparisons. I am not a connoisseur of anything. But from my mere two weeks of close tea comparisons I feel the beginnings of a mental map. I hope, as Robin says, it will allow me to enjoy tea I can afford. In Beijing, the most expensive tea is insanely expensive &#8212; like $1000/pound.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am in Beijing. The smog is bad. It is more humid than usual and the air is dirtier than usual. At his blog, James Fallows, who is also in Beijing, has <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/02/please-welcome-dougherty-and-klapmeier-fingleton-fisher-and-jenne/71488/">posted  pictures and pollution measurements</a>. (Incidentally, Eamonn Fingleton, an excellent writer, will be guest-blogging there. <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/fingleton-hard.html">In Praise of Hard Industries</a> </em>is one of the best business/economics books I&#8217;ve read.)</p>
<p>The effect of smog on health isn&#8217;t obvious. Maybe you know about <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/041018/18calabrese.htm">hormesis</a> &#8212; the finding that a small dose of a poison, such as <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mo/radioadaptive/inthorm.html">radioactivity</a>, is beneficial. It has been observed in hundreds of experiments. It makes sense: the poisons activate repair systems. Even if you know about hormesis, you probably don&#8217;t know that one of the first studies of smoking and cancer found that inhaling cigarette smoke appeared beneficial: inhalers had less cancer than non-inhalers. R. A. Fisher, the great statistician, <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/fisher274.pdf">emphasized this</a> (pp. 160-161):</p>
<blockquote><p>There were fewer inhalers among the cancer patients than among the non-cancer patients. That, I think, is an exceedingly important finding.</p></blockquote>
<p>This difference (a negative correlation) appeared in spite of two positive correlations: Heavy smokers get more cancer than light smokers; and heavy smokers are more likely to inhale than light smokers. It is far from the only fact suggesting <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~ray/TSSOASb.html">the connection between smoking and health isn&#8217;t simple</a>.</p>
<p>So I am not worried about Beijing smog. The real danger, I think, is <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/umami-hypothesis/">not eating fermented foods</a>. Which, thankfully, is infinitely more under my control.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sounds like we&#8217;re under attack. Bombs going off, gunfire. A few fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> At midnight I was awakened by the densest loudest fireworks I have ever seen. About two per second for ten minutes or even longer. One launch pad was on the street near my apartment; I could see two other sources further away &#8212; geysers of glittery light. This proves the Chinese invented fireworks, I kept thinking. They were so pretty and varied I didn&#8217;t mind being woken up. And it was so nice to be able to watch them from my warm apartment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In downtown Berkeley I met a group of Chinese students from Beijing. They were entering freshmen at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>They said there were 40 students like them &#8212; from Beijing, entering UC Berkeley. (At Tsinghua, there will be 400 entering freshmen from Beijing.) In all of China, 13 students were admitted to Harvard, about the same number to Yale and Princeton. One of them said she&#8217;d wanted to go to Northwestern but hadn&#8217;t gotten in. Had she gone to college in China, she might have gone to Renmin University, perhaps the #3 university in China.</p>
<p>Surely their parents were wealthy, yes. But they preferred an American college to a Chinese one for two main reasons: 1. They can choose whatever major they want. At Chinese universities students are often forced into a major they don&#8217;t want if their scores are high enough to get into a prestigious university but not high enough to get into the major they want at that university. 2. They believe that if they graduate from an American university they will have more opportunities. Where did they get the idea of coming to Berkeley? I asked. Online, they said. Their English was really good.</p>
<p>The &#8220;more opportunities&#8221; may not be as simple as they think. In Beijing I know a Chinese businesswoman who hired a recent college graduate. She&#8217;d gone to college in England, indicating that her parents were wealthy. The new worker turned out to be irresponsible and had to be fired. Perhaps her parents had spoiled her. In this businesswoman&#8217;s eyes, an overseas education may now be a negative.</p>
