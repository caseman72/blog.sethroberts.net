				<small>Thursday, December 13th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>At the November meeting of the Psychonomic Society, a group of experimental psychologists, I gave a 15-minute talk (<a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/2007-11-16%20Rapid%20Effects%20of%20Omega-3%20Fats%20on%20Brain%20Function.ppt">PowerPoint</a>) about my omega-3 research. (Anyone know how to add audio to a PowerPoint file?) Almost all the data in the talk I&#8217;ve posted here, but it had one not-blogged idea, which I summarize like this: </p>
<p>optimize brain &#8211;> optimize body</p>
<p>The intake level of a nutrient that optimizes brain function should be close to the level that optimizes the function of everything else. In particular, the omega-3 intake that makes the brain work best should be close to the level that makes the rest of the body work best. This is because the brain and the rest of the body are bathed in the same blood. </p>
<p>It is easy to see why this is so. I have many electrical appliances: clock, telephone, TV, microwave, refrigerator, laser printer. In spite of vastly different innards and functions, all of them run best when their electrical supply is very close to house current. The electric current that makes my laser printer work best is very close to the electric current that makes my refrigerator work best. Of course, this is by design. LIkewise, the different parts of our body, although doing vastly different things, have all been adjusted by evolution to work best with the nutritional equivalent of house current. Just as we might study laser printers to learn what current to use with our refrigerator, we can study the brain to learn what nutrients optimize immune function.</p>
<p>This is a new idea in nutrition (at least, new to me). It is supported by and explains some of the most interesting data I&#8217;ve posted. It explains why Tyler Cowen&#8217;s gums got <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-surgery-commuted/">so much better so quickly</a> &#8212; because he was taking almost exactly the best amount of flaxseed oil for his gums. Tyler chose his intake of flaxseed oil based on my behavioral data, which suggested the best amount was between 2 and 3 tablespoons/day. The gums and the brain could hardly be more different, but the best level for the brain turned out to do a wonderful job of healing his gums. Same thing with <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/">Anonymous and sports injuries</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, this shows the scientific value of blogging. My gums got better, too, but not as impressively as Tyler&#8217;s. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of injuries to heal. The big improvements noticed by Tyler and Anonymous were &#8220;accidents&#8221; (unintended consequences). Science thrives on accidents; blogging, it turns out, is a new way to generate them.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, December 11th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://hippocratech.org/">Michelle Nguyen</a> told me that in <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/23/blogging-and-meritocracy/">Palo Alto</a>, professional contacts expect you to have a blog. If you don&#8217;t have a blog, you&#8217;re not a serious person. </p>
<p>At a recent <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/12/11/everyday-humor-part-2/">wine tasting</a>, I encountered the other, nicer side of the coin. I met Colleen and Vanessa, two of the three women behind <a href="http://wishboneclover.typepad.com/">Wishbone Clover</a>, a blog without a theme. &#8220;We just blog about what we care about,&#8221; Vanessa said (as I <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/12/09/the-value-not-so-hidden-of-blogging/">have guessed</a>). It&#8217;s a way of talking to each other and, oh yeah, other people can read it.</p>
<p>I said I had a blog, too. </p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been stalked on your blog?&#8221; Colleen asked. This might be the friendliest question I&#8217;ve ever been asked at a party. </p>
<p>&#8220;Stalked?&#8221; I said. </p>
<p>She meant that someone had repeatedly left very nasty comments on her blog, such as &#8220;you draw like a 4-year-old&#8221; (she is a graphic designer and often posts drawings). </p>
<p>I said no, most comments are favorable. No one has ever left nasty comments. </p>
<p>She explained that she had been at a museum party in Boston and a woman at the party thought that she (Colleen) had been hitting on her (the stalker&#8217;s) girlfriend. that&#8217;s what caused the stalking. It really upset her. </p>
<p>The women behind Wishbone Clover met when they worked at Wells Fargo. All three were told working at Wells was an &#8220;awesome opportunity&#8221;; all three left. Colleen now works at another bank. Vanessa is a writer; she has a writing job at UCSF and writes fiction. I forget what the third one does.</p>
<p>Wishbone Clover has a great list of categories, including <em>aggrieved</em>, <em>I am so mad right now</em>, <em>glimpses</em>, <em>special guest star</em>, <em>exchanged</em> (conversations), and the mysterious <em>hlp</em>. I especially liked an entry called &#8220;<a href="http://wishboneclover.typepad.com/wishbone_clover/2007/12/my-mothers-roya.html">My Mother&#8217;s Royal We</a>.&#8221; It begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>One recent morning I chatted, via IM, with my BFF, EB. I noticed a quirk in our conversation: when I describe some difficulty, especially related to poorly behaved gentlemen, she tends to respond in the third person, for example:</p>
<p><em>We don&#8217;t have time for that bullshit. Let&#8217;s drug his drink, leave him in Nebraska, and see how he fares.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>However, she doesn&#8217;t like it when her mom uses the royal <em>we</em>. &#8220;We don&#8217;t like raw fish,&#8221; her mom once said.</p>

					<p>The evolutionary sequence is:</p>
<p>1. Facial expressions and vocalizations.</p>
<p>2. Language (speech and writing).</p>
<p>3. Blogging.</p>
<p>Each makes clearer to everyone else what is inside us. Human nature being what it is &#8212; <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/category/human-evolution/my-theory-of-human-evolution-directory/">closely tied to occupational specialization</a> &#8212; it should be no surprise that blogging is very useful in getting a job, as Penelope Trunk <a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2006/05/23/blogging-essential-for-a-good-career/">says</a>. To get a job you need a skill. Your skill is inside you; blogging makes it much more apparent. Blogging shows not only that you have a skill but that you have an emotional attachment, too: Bloggers write about what they care about. Not only does blogging help you get a job, it helps you get a job you want.</p>
<p>There should be software that creates networks of blogs based on similarity. I wish I knew which blogs were most like mine, for example.</p>

					<p>An article in the current issue of the <em>American Journal of Epidemiology</em> is about participants in a large health survey. It compares people who turned in the questionnaire via the Web with those who answered via mail.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over 50% of 77,047 participants chose to enroll in the study via the Web . . . The authors compared the demographic and health characteristics of Web responders with those of paper responders. Web responders were slightly more likely to be male, to be younger, to have a high school diploma or college degree, and to work in information technology or another technical occupation. Web responders were more likely to be obese and to smoke more cigarettes and were less likely to be problem alcohol drinkers and to report occupational exposures.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study began in 2001. </p>

					<p>Janet Ruhl <a href="http://diabetesupdate.blogspot.com/">blogs</a> about diabetes and maintains a website called &#8220;<a href="http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14045524.php">How to get your blood sugar under control</a>.&#8221; Thanks to Dave Lull, I came across her <a href="http://diabetesupdate.blogspot.com/2007/10/taubes-good-calories-bad-calories-lost.html">critique</a> of <em>Good Calories, Bad Calories</em> (&#8220;some of the densest writing I&#8217;ve encountered in a long life of reading popular science . . . its core message is VERY important&#8221; &#8212; I agree with both) and noticed a comment by her that blogging turned out to be a good idea. Ah, blogging. She kindly agreed to answer a few questions.</p>
<p><em>Why did blogging turn out to be a good thing to do?</em></p>
<p>Blogging introduced me to a new group of younger people who have been a pleasure to interact with. I was accustomed to the more traditional web information exchange venues, having been active in online forums since I joined Compuserve in 1987. But many of the bloggers are younger and don&#8217;t appear to be familiar with the newsgroups or even the larger discussion forums dedicated to my topic. Once I started blogging and syndicating my blog [via RSS], these bloggers introduced themselves [by commenting on her blog]. I really like the positive supportive atmosphere that they bring to interaction. </p>
<p><em>What have you learned from blogging?</em></p>
<p>In the health community, at least, the younger people whose online communication is confined to blogging seem to be more positive and supportive and less likely to use internet communication to indulge the kinds of flaming and obsessional nuttiness that seems to have destroyed the newsgroups as a viable place for intelligent discourse. They also make very good use of multimedia when making their points.</p>
<p><em>You seem to be saying blogging brings out a better side of human nature.</em></p>
<p>Not really. It is just that the structure of blogging allows each person to be heard,  and leaves it to the audience to vote with their attention for content. Stridency and conflict are minimized because comments are moderated. A person can, of course, contradict another person, in their own blog, but they have to attract readers and conflict alone is not a strong attraction.</p>

					<p>Please, I want to read <em>Culture Shock! Palo Alto</em>. Michelle Nguyen, who does healthcare software consulting, recently moved to Palo Alto from the East Coast. </p>
<p>On the East Coast, she said, one of the first questions she was asked was about her education. If you have a Ph.D., they take you seriously.</p>
<p>In Palo Alto, among the first questions are (a) where did you go to school? and (b) do you have a blog? It doesn&#8217;t help to have a Ph.D. It does help to have gone to Stanford or an Ivy League school. And &#8212; most encouragingly &#8212; it helps to have a blog. Having a blog, said Michelle, shows that you think and have ideas. Yes, it does.</p>
<p><a href="http://geeknalytics.wordpress.com/">Michelle&#8217;s new blog</a> is &#8220;a place for thinking about all things tech, web, and gadget.&#8221; Her first entry reviews Microsoft&#8217;s HealthVault, which allows you to store your health info online.</p>

					<p>If I didn&#8217;t blog it, I didn&#8217;t think it. Nonsense, right? Well, let&#8217;s rephrase the ancient question &#8220;if a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, did it make a sound?&#8221; Of course this is true:</p>
<p>tree makes sound &#8211;> someone hears</p>
<p>where &#8211;> indicates causality. X &#8211;> Y means X causes Y. </p>
<p>But what about</p>
<p>someone hears &#8211;> tree makes sound?</p>
<p>This had always struck me as boring. Who cares? But I am noticing that while this is obvious</p>
<p>I think of something &#8211;> I blog about it</p>
<p>this is not so obvious, but true:</p>
<p>I blog about it &#8211;> I think of something</p>
<p>Because I blog about my thoughts, I have more of them. I blog, therefore I think.</p>
<p>This post and others about blogging, for example. Posts about the twilight of expertise in areas other than science. I&#8217;d be doing omega-3 self-experimentation blog or no blog but blogging about it divides the research into small and more doable parts (making the graphs, for example). It is encouraging to get feedback and have others, such as <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/02/16/omega-3-and-arithmetic/">Tim Lundeen</a>, contribute their observations. Blogging is a kind of tinder. It doesn&#8217;t create the initial spark but it amplifies it.</p>
<p>In terms of book and scientific-paper writing, blogging plays the <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/06/07/my-theory-of-human-evolution-scrapbook-edition/">role I give art </a>in the growth of technology: It provides a slope in place of a step. It divides a big task into tiny tasks.</p>

					<p>Abu Ayyub Ibrahim is behind <a href="http://www.behindtheapprovalmatrix.com/">Behind the Approval Matrix</a> &#8212; that is, <em>New York</em> magazine&#8217;s <a href="http://nymag.com/arts/all/approvalmatrix/37962/">Approval Matrix</a>, which is the first thing I read &#8212; if that&#8217;s the right word &#8212; in every issue. For example:</p>

<p>Ibrahim&#8217;s blog or whatever you call it explains the items in the Approval Matrix. </p>
<p>I wonder why Ibrahim and I like it so much. Perhaps 1. We enjoy praise and dispraise. 2. Cute little pictures. 3. Use of pictures as dots. 4. Draws our attention to stuff we may enjoy but otherwise wouldn&#8217;t know about (e.g., YouTube clips). 5. Unpompous. 6. Artistic in the Nabokovian sense (i.e., implies a better world &#8212; see Afterword to Lolita). 7. Mixes high and low. (My students laughed when I wrote &#8220;pimple&#8221; on the board.) 8. Sometimes witty.</p>

					<p><em><a href="http://www.word-geek.com/">Anastasia Goodstein</a>, a San Francisco writer, blogs at <a href="http://www.ypulse.com/">Ypulse</a> &#8212; Y as in youth, meaning teenagers.  She came to blogging from the &#8220;other side&#8221; &#8212; from journalism rather than subject-matter expertise &#8212; and blogging is one way she makes a living. She has written a book called <a href="http://www.totallywiredbook.com/">Totally Wired: What Teens and Tweens are Really Doing Online</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>What did you slowly learn about blogging from doing it?</em></p>
<p>I learned when you are running a professional blog that has to be updated every day (or five days a week), you just can&#8217;t be brilliant every day. You have days where you have no clue what to blog about or when you&#8217;re just not inspired, but still you have to post. I also learned that posts I think might be amazing may get no response while other posts that I didn&#8217;t think were that great generate lots of comments. I have found ways to produce content that don&#8217;t rely on me having to write full blown posts all the time. I do a lot of Q&#038;As (like this), repost some of the more interesting comments and have easy features like Ypulse Quote (where I find a relevant and interesting quote) or From The Ypulse WTF files (a short post about something that just makes you scratch your head).</p>
<p>I think blogging is a great way to work your writing muscles and develop/strengthen your writing voice &#8212; it takes focus and discipline and it&#8217;s public so you get feedback on what you do. I love blogs where you find great info and get to know the blogger &#8212; For example, USA Today&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/popcandy/">Pop Candy</a>, written by Whitney Matheson is one of my favorites.</p>
<p><em>What do non-bloggers fail to realize about blogging?</em></p>
<p>I think non-bloggers don&#8217;t realize how much work it is (see number one) &#8212; to build a decent readership, you have to update your blog pretty regularly. They may not realize that blogging can be financially lucrative &#8212; there are many writers now being hired as professional bloggers, individual bloggers like myself who have build media brands from their blogs and consultants and agencies who have used their blogs to generate lots of business.</p>
<p><em>You write: &#8220;Since May 2004 Ypulse has been updated five days a week . . . [in] September 2006 . . I decided to try to make Ypulse my full-time gig.&#8221; Was it a hard decision? What was behind it, besides the obvious advantages of working for oneself?</em></p>
<p>The decision to leave Current TV was agonizing &#8212; I love the mission of the network and very much enjoyed the people I worked with. I left partly to be able to promote my book, Totally Wired, which came out in March of 2007, and because Ypulse was becoming more than just a side project. The scariest part of leaving a job is leaving the security of a regular paycheck and benefits. I also wasn&#8217;t sure where I wanted to focus. I was going to try consulting, maybe launch a paid subscription product &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t sure.  It has been a year since I left my job, and it was the best decision I&#8217;ve made. I now have a business partner helping me grow, a successful conference business and am still promoting my book on the road, which I never could have done working full time.</p>

<p>SR: Why did you start?</p>
<p>JC: Because HuntGrunt was too good a name not to use. Also, I started at the time we had <a href="http://walkthrough.nytimes.com/">The Walk-through</a>. [A Times real-estate blog.]  The Walk-through was on WordPress and WordPress sucks. It&#8217;s all buggy and glitchy. I had to teach myself HTML to even do it. It was while I was doing that that I came up with HuntGrunt.</p>
<p>SR: Did you think of HuntGrunt?</p>
<p>JC: My very first entry tells you that. You can&#8217;t make a diminutive from my name. You can&#8217;t make a diminutive from &#8220;The Hunt&#8221; either.</p>
<p>SR: You&#8217;d be JCo. Like JLo.</p>
<p>JC: No one&#8217;s ever called me that. HuntGrunt came from <a href="http://propertygrunt.blogspot.com/">Property Grunt</a>. Property Grunt would write to me &#8212;  to me and about me. He&#8217;s a Corcoran broker. Property Grunt was his name and all of a sudden HuntGrunt came to me.</p>
<p>SR: You&#8217;re the pure artist who has an idea and has to use it. Your blog is a way of drawing attention to the phrase HuntGrunt.</p>
<p>JC: Without the name HuntGrunt, I&#8217;m not sure it would exist. I&#8217;m not sure there would be much resonance.</p>

				<small>Thursday, August 9th, 2007</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Two days ago, Dubner and Levitt, the <em>Freakonomics</em> authors, moved their <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/">blog</a> to the Opinion section of the <em>NY Times</em> website. There was a big announcement on the <em>Times</em> home page. Dubner posted a short and modest <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/moving-day/">note</a> about the move (&#8220;we are excited and flattered&#8221;). It got over 100 comments, mostly about the lack of full RSS feed (&#8220;I thought this move would be good news but the truncated RSS feed pisses me off&#8221;) along with a few formulaic congratulations. </p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll say it: This is a fantastic accomplishment. Two days ago was a great day for freedom of speech. For the first time ever, someone &#8212; actually two people &#8212; can say whatever they want as often as they want however they want (long, short, funny, serious, video, text) in the most coveted spot in the entire media world. Levitt took the new freedom out for a spin by posting a what might be considered <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/if-you-were-a-terrorist-how-would-you-attack/">a big help to terrorists</a>. Nothing like that has ever appeared in the <em>Times</em> or any other major newspaper in the whole history of newspapers, I&#8217;m quite sure. Nor anywhere else with a big audience.</p>
<p>David Brooks earned his Op-Ed column, yes, but he was also given it. His influence went way up when he started that job. Were he to lose his column, his influence would clearly diminish. He can be fired, in other words, and being fired would hurt him. Dubner and Levitt, on the other hand, can upset the people who control the <em>Times</em> as often and as deeply as they wish. They can be removed from the <em>Times</em> but it will make little difference to them &#8212; it might even help them. No matter what they say, no matter how many powerful people they offend, they will always be able to find a hosting service for their blog and will always have a big respectful audience. If anyone should be worried about offending anyone else, the people who run the <em>Times</em> should be worried about offending Dubner and Levitt. That&#8217;s taking freedom of speech to a whole new level.</p>
<p>To the right of David Brooks&#8217; column &#8212; which appears twice a week and has a fairly constant length, format, and tone &#8212; on the <em>Times</em> website is a blank area. David Brooks controls none of it. Whereas to the right of the Freakonomics blog is  the largest set of links ever to appear on the Times website, completely under the authors&#8217; control. One section (5 links) is titled Organ Transplants. Dubner and Levitt believe that the regulations about organ transplants are too restrictive. Given its visibility and prestige placement, that little section is not just a constant reminder of their position but a powerful force for change.  It is a new kind of activism. The rest of the <em>Times&#8217;s</em> dozen-odd blogs have tiny blogrolls if any, always narrow-focus and never activist.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the tangible power, there is also the symbolism of it: A blog is being given the utmost respect. Blogs are inherently about diversity of voices and the notion that everyone has something to say.  Editorials are not (of course). Newspaper columns are not (they are almost always by journalists). Now that the <em>Times</em> has shown a blog such respect, other important places will do the same. The esteem of blogs will rise in the world and, inextricably, so will the beliefs they embody.</p>

					<p><em>Joyce Cohen, the <em>New York Times</em> real-estate columnist behind <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/joyce_cohen/index.html?inline=nyt-per">The Hunt</a>, blogs at <a href="http://huntgrunt.blogspot.com/">HuntGrunt</a>, one of my favorite blogs. I interviewed her about blogging.</em></p>
<p>SR: Do you like blogging?</p>
<p>JC: No.</p>
<p>SR: Why not?</p>
<p>JC: There&#8217;s easy blogging and hard blogging. Easy blogging is like a diary &#8212; you want to write about your bad dates or complain about your mother or your boss . . . the kind of thing that otherwise you would do in longhand. Hard blogging feels more obligatory. It&#8217;s time-consuming and labor-intensive and the payoff isn&#8217;t clear. The technology is still not up to snuff. There are space issues: You can&#8217;t quite figure out the spacing to make the picture go in the right place. It&#8217;s easy to make a typo and not notice it until later. You can endlessly tinker to make it look good. Sometimes, updates are necessary. In some ways, it never ends.</p>
<p>SR: Why do you blog if you don&#8217;t like doing it?</p>
<p>JC: I don&#8217;t know. I started. It has a momentum of its own. The more gratifying stuff is the stuff that gets linked to by someone else and commented upon. If <a href="http://www.curbed.com/">Curbed</a> or <a href="http://gothamist.com/">Gothamist</a> or <a href="http://gawker.com/">Gawker</a> links to the blog or one of my stories, that&#8217;s interesting. Especially because of the feedback. And occasionally there is something that I want to say.</p>
<p>SR: Many bloggers stop.</p>
<p>JC: I think a lot of people try it and find that there are many reasons not to continue. Maybe it&#8217;s not as great as they initially thought. Maybe they started it not really knowing. I&#8217;m not sure a lot of people start intending to stop.</p>
<p>SR: Yeah, that would be a small number of people.</p>
<p>JC: Unless you blog because of a particular project. Like if you&#8217;re blogging during your kitchen renovation or during your Shangri-La diet or for some very specific purpose like that. I don&#8217;t know that people start a  blog and say, I&#8217;m doing this in order to stop doing it. I think people embark on it not knowing what it&#8217;s like.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/blogging-doubts.html">Robin Hanson</a> has doubts about the long-term value of blogging &#8212; especially his own:</p>
<blockquote><p>My main doubt is whether this will accumulate . . . We get over a thousand readers a day here, and those readers must be influenced somehow.  But do those influences add up to a long term net effect?</p>
<p>Consider that before the farming revolution humanity&#8217;s knowledge accumulated very slowly.  Each person learned a great deal over the course of his lifetime, both by discovering new insights for himself and by listening to others.  Nevertheless, the distribution of knowledge in the population hardly changed; each new generation had to rediscover and relearn the same insights all over again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before farming, I believe new insights were passed down in three ways. 1. Stories. Stories are to teaching as good food is to nourishment. Whenever I tell a story, my students pay close attention. 2. Apprenticeships. 3. Specialists talking to each other &#8212; a manifestation of the <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/13/my-theory-of-human-evolution-blogs-and-fan-clubs-edition-or-why-we-blog/">Fan Club Instinct</a>. Blogging is a new version of Method 3. When old specialists talked to young specialists, knowledge was passed down. Robin is young, but his posts are influencing even younger persons. </p>
<p>I think blogging is a good use of my time for several reasons. 1. Advertising. I hope blogging will draw attention to my papers and book and future work. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2006/11/26/brian-wansink-on-research-design/">Brian Wansink</a> nicely made this point (scientists should advertise). 2. <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1338316&#038;blobtype=pdf">Quasi-reinforcement</a>. Blogging divides a big task (writing a book or paper) into much smaller tasks (writing posts). 3. Data collection. Because of my omega-3 posts, two other people gathered data useful (very) to me. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/04/14/omega-3-and-arithmetic-continued/">Tim Lundeen&#8217;s data</a> led me to study new tasks. Tyler Cowen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/07/todays-happines.html">experience with flaxseed oil</a> is enormously important to my omega-3 research.</p>
<p>But I have to agree with Robin that blogging sometimes seems too seductive &#8212; that I should write fewer posts like this one and more that fit into the book and papers I want to write. I keep thinking of something Philip Weiss said in <a href="http://www.philipweiss.org/">his blog</a>: For men, the most enjoyable form of expression is the Op-Ed piece.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Marc Andreessen, in a fascinating post about <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/07/eleven-lessons-.html">lessons learned from blogging</a>, started me thinking about fan clubs. After reading his post, I wondered what had <em>I</em> learned from blogging.  Well, nothing very interesting: 1. Easier than expected. 2. More fun than expected. 3. Pleasantly surprised to see audience grow for the esoteric topics I blog about, such as scientific method and human evolution. These are quite different than Marc&#8217;s lessons.</p>
<p>But maybe not. I think Marc gets to the heart of the matter with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>one of the best things about blogs is how they enable a conversation among people with shared interests.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is exactly what fan clubs and fan conventions do. </p>
<p>Every blog I read revolves around someone&#8217;s specialized knowledge. <a href="http://huntgrunt.blogspot.com/">HuntGrunt</a>, for example, is based on Joyce Cohen&#8217;s journalism: In her blog, she writes what few others could. Bloggers enjoy writing them, I enjoy reading them. I think blogs have done grown so quickly and become so powerful because they tap into something very fundamental and important inside of all of us: We enjoy talking about our area of specialization, of expertise; and we enjoy listening to others with similar interests. Fan clubs and interest groups were old expressions of this; blogs are a new expression.</p>
<p>Why are people like this? My theory of human evolution says that the human brain changed in all sorts of ways to promote occupation specialization, the big way we differ from our closest ancestors. The fan-club tendency evolved because it caused specialists to share their knowledge. This pushed forward technology just as scientific journals and conferences do. People who made shoes talked to others who made shoes and shared what they had learned. The result was not only better shoes but also better use of research effort: No one had to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Blog posts are easy and pleasant to write because they allow me to do something I enjoy doing: talk about my area of expertise. Their esoteric subject matter is crucial: I wouldn&#8217;t enjoy talking about other stuff. Maybe this tendency has other uses. People with specialized interests who <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/06/life-size-faces/">chat every morning via webcam</a> &#8212; now there&#8217;s an idea&#8230;</p>

					<p>In <em>The New Yorker</em>, Orhan Pamuk writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best thing about Istanbul street food now is not that each purveyor is different from all the others, offering his own specialties; it is that these different street venders sell only the things that they themselves know and love.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/05/16/why-blogs-are-better-written/">what</a> I was saying about blogs: They are so well-written, so easy to read, because bloggers only write about what they care about.</p>

					<blockquote><p>I heard about [the Shangri-La] diet from someone on a discussion group I&#8217;m part of and it sounded like total bunk. . . . This person pushes my buttons, so I decided I would test the diet. If it worked, I&#8217;d lose some unhealthy weight (three pregnancies combined with the stress of recent years left me 40 pounds overweight for my height), and if it didn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;d have the satisfaction of proving her wrong. It was a win/win.</p></blockquote>
<p>I chuckle every time I read this. <a href="http://mamampj.blogspot.com/2007/06/8-things-about-me.html">It</a> continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>I eliminated my two daily Cokes . . . from my diet and replaced them with the equivalent amount of liquid and calories from sugar water. I&#8217;ve been less hungry and losing weight ever since. Damn her!</p></blockquote>
