				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I posted <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/26/lessons-of-this-blog" target="_blank">Kristen Marcum&#8217;s list of general rules</a> she&#8217;d learned from this blog. (For example, &#8220;be skeptical of experts.&#8221;) Behind her list, I think there is one idea, slightly hidden from view:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>non-experts can discover important things about health</strong></p>
<p>By <em>non-experts</em> I mean people who are not health professionals. People who do not make a living from health research. By <em>discover </em>I mean <em>learn from data for the first time</em>, actually discover &#8212; in contrast to learn from an expert. By <em>important</em> I mean stuff that matters to many people. (It&#8217;s obvious that studying yourself you can help yourself.) I haven&#8217;t heard anyone else say this, although it isn&#8217;t far from the Quantified Self movement. </p>
<p>The first example of this rule was the work of Richard Bernstein, an engineer with diabetes. In the 1960s, he pioneered home blood glucose testing, now enormously important. Another example, I hope, is my work. I used self-tracking and self-experimentation to find <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">important new cause-effect relationships in several areas</a> &#8212; new ways to sleep better or lose weight, for example. I believe my conclusions will turn out be true for many people, not just me, because they fit well with research done with other people and animals. I&#8217;m a professional scientist, which obviously helped, but not a health researcher.<span id="more-12603"></span></p>
<p>Why is this rule true? I found it hard to explain even my discoveries. <a  href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">The first time</a> I tried, I didn&#8217;t do well. I did better <a  href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">the second time</a>.</p>
<p>I came to see that discoveries require several things &#8212; more precisely, rate of discovery is a product of several factors. Everyone sees that experts have several advantages over non-experts:</p>
<ol>
<li>more training (graduate school)</li>
<li>more resources (equipment, grants, space, assistants, journals, specialized libraries, and so on)</li>
<li>more hours per day (all working day)</li>
<li>more experience (their entire working life)</li>
</ol>
<p>What I&#8217;ve never seen pointed out is that non-experts have several advantages over experts:</p>
<ol>
<li>more time overall (with no pressure to publish, a non-expert can easily spend many years on one question)</li>
<li>more freedom (no pressure to follow a party line, obey your boss or be popular)</li>
<li>more motivation (non-experts want to improve their own health, or a loved one&#8217;s health; for health researchers it&#8217;s a job)</li>
<li>ability to self-track and self-experiment (this is too humble for experts)</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of my job, I was only slightly behind health experts in terms of their four advantages, and I was far ahead of them in terms of the four non-expert advantages. This explains why I discovered many things that experts had not managed to discover.</p>
<p>Once I had a reasonable understanding of what had happened, I saw there was no reason I should be the only one. As a professor, I had excellent library access, much better than most, but now, with the Internet, many people have comparable access to research. Supporting my prediction that I am not the only non-expert who can do this, I have found other non-experts who have made important discoveries. Tara Grant figured out that <a href="http://primalgirl.com/2011/11/01/nprimalgirl-sleep-issues-vitamin-d/" target="_blank">the time of day she takes Vitamin D made a big difference</a>. Professional researchers have not yet figured this out. Katie Reid found that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/05/17/journal-of-personal-science-one-childs-autism-eliminated-by-removal-of-glutamate-from-her-diet/" target="_blank">her autistic daughter completely recovered</a> &#8212; autism symptoms completely gone &#8212; when all glutamate was removed from her diet. Professional autism researchers haven&#8217;t managed to cure even one case of autism, as far as I know. Stuart King figured out that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/10/11/association-of-sleep-and-chronic-illness/#comment-1150683" target="_blank">a tablespoon of honey at bedtime greatly improved his sleep</a>. No sleep or nutrition researcher has realized this.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, my mother&#8217;s mother sent my mother newspaper clippings about computers, of which, at the time, there were only a few. <em>This is going to be important</em>, she said. Let me continue the tradition by telling you <em>this is going to be important.</em></p>
<p>When even a tiny fraction of non-experts become &#8220;health knowledge generators&#8221; (for lack of a better term) the world will change. Some of the reasons:</p>
<p>1. <strong>The IQ advantage</strong>. There are far more non-experts than health researchers. A factor of 100,000? Let&#8217;s say health researchers have <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/2006/03/iq-in-different-fields.html" target="_blank">an average IQ of 130</a>. If you take 100,000 non-experts (mean IQ = 100, standard deviation = 15) the top IQ among them will be about 165.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Trust and generalizability</strong>. When a health expert advises you to do Treatment X (e.g., surgery), what should you think? Can you (a) trust him and (b) is what he says true for you? Any reader of this blog knows that health experts routinely overstate benefits and understate costs of the treatment they are promoting. Even if they are telling the whole truth, their advice is based, at best, on several studies. Is what those studies found &#8212; studying animals, or at best, other humans &#8212; true for <strong>you</strong>? When you study yourself  &#8211; for example, carefully measuring the effect of a drug &#8212; error due to distortions and differences from the study population go to zero.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Good and bad chemicals</strong>. We encounter thousands of chemicals, many of recent origin. How we react to them &#8212; do they help or hurt? &#8212; is determined by our genome (billions of possibilities) and environmental history (countless possibilities). Any sort of expert testing will be woefully incomplete. The danger in assuming that a chemical safe for most people is safe for you is illustrated by a woman who found her almost constant migraines <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html" target="_blank">were caused by household cleaning products</a> and Katie Reid&#8217;s discovery that her daughter was very sensitive to glutamate (found in a large fraction of supermarket foods). That things claimed to be safe may be dangerous is illustrated by the Berkeley graduate student who became <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/09/20/teeth-clenching-can-release-mercury/" target="_blank">poisoned by mercury when he started grinding his teeth</a> and my discovery that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/12/09/warning-soybean-eaters-tofu-made-me-stupid/" target="_blank">fermented tofu made me stupid</a> for a few days. My experience with tofu and <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/blog/pdf/2012-09-24-The-Growth-of-Personal-Science-Implications-For-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank">butter</a> shows how a non-expert can do better than simply accept what experts say. My brain tracking, which anyone could do, detected previously-unknown or -unclear costs and benefits.</p>
<p>Our economy runs on specialization. We buy cars from car specialists, for example. Long ago, professionals had a monopoly on knowledge. To learn math, you had to pay a math teacher. Then came cheap printing and mass literacy and mathematics books and libraries. The same knowledge became not just free but widely available. Then came the Internet and <em>Wikipedia</em> and Google &#8212; even more available. But all this time, the source of the knowledge, its creation, was restricted to professionals. Only professionals (or rich amateurs, like Darwin) could &#8220;make&#8221; (or &#8220;mine&#8221;) the knowledge. Now that will change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kirsten Marcum told me she had &#8220;put a number of [my] findings to use in [her] own life.&#8221; I asked how. She replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve put a few of your specific recommendations to work (SLD, standing on one leg each day, omega-3s, more animal fat/pork fat, butter tea, fermented foods)&#8230;but in thinking about this, I realized I&#8217;ve gotten even more use out of general principles I&#8217;ve drawn from your blog over the years:<span id="more-12546"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Trust your results</strong>. I&#8217;m thinking of your own (and other people&#8217;s) experiments with what caused acne (dairy, etc.) or migraines (soy) and helped restless leg syndrome (b6) or sleep, etc. You and others tried solutions, and the solutions either worked or they didn&#8217;t, and you/they looked to correct root causes, and those corrections either worked or they didn&#8217;t. If you still have acne, the acne treatment didn&#8217;t work&#8211;even if it should have, and even if an expert recommended it&#8230;and you probably shouldn&#8217;t just keep doing the treatment just because it&#8217;s supposed to work. And if you cleared your acne, then the intervention worked&#8211;regardless of whether it &#8220;should&#8221; have. If your brain performance improves in a measurable way after eating butter, trust that result&#8211;and be skeptical about the people who tell you butter is damaging your health. If treating a leaky gut improves your thyroid labs, trust that&#8211;not the doctor who says your leaky gut diet is too restrictive and is going to damage your health.</p>
<p><strong>2. Many unpleasant circumstances are reversible</strong>. It&#8217;s often possible to find positive interventions that ameliorate, reduce, or remove things that are bothering you&#8211;many of which are cheap or free and not hard to implement. It&#8217;s possible to fix health issues, productivity problems, make learning more fun or effective, etc. It&#8217;s amazing to me how many people don&#8217;t think this is true&#8211;that you&#8217;re stuck with extra weight, or acne, or creaky joints, or back pain, or migraines, or the inability to motivate yourself to work&#8211;and there&#8217;s nothing you can do.</p>
<p><strong>3. Most things that are beneficial are also pleasurable, and vice versa</strong>. When something is good for us, we usually find it pleasurable (animal fat, salt, sugar at night, umami flavors, learning while moving, faces in the morning). Otherwise, how would we have evolved to do it?</p>
<p>I extend this to say: If something&#8217;s not pleasurable but supposed to be beneficial, it&#8217;s either bunk or you&#8217;re doing it wrong (i.e., in a way that removes the pleasure and possibly the benefit.) So look for the pleasure&#8211;because then you&#8217;re more likely to do it and to see a benefit.</p>
<p>And: If something is pleasurable but not beneficial, your body probably wants something very similar and it&#8217;s confused&#8211;junk food umami vs. fermented foods. In which case, find a pleasurable AND beneficial substitute, and it will be easy to stop doing the thing that is not beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be skeptical of experts.</strong> Most experts have incentives that have nothing to do with the reasons you&#8217;re consulting them. Understand this, look for their motivations/weaknesses/blind spots, and always check what they&#8217;re telling you against what your body (or other results) are telling you. Also look for non-experts with interesting ideas.</p>
<p><strong>5. What&#8217;s good for the brain is good for the body</strong>. I would add to this: Many things that we think of as personality or mental/emotional issues actually have a physiological basis&#8211;and optimizing your health will likely have a positive effect.</p>
<p>They sound elementary, but they&#8217;re counter to the way nearly everyone I know thinks.</p>
<p>Over the years, thinking like this has improved my life in multiple ways:</p>
<p>- I 100% cured my back pain (after 3 rough years) with Esther Gokhale&#8217;s 8 Steps to a Pain Free back&#8211;which cost $17 and provided more practical and helpful advice than the two doctors, physical therapist, and personal trainer I consulted.</p>
<p>- After a bunch of looking, I found a doctor who, when presented with new ideas, says: &#8220;That&#8217;s interesting. Where did you find out about it, and what have you tried?&#8221; More than once, she has looked into the subject, found the new recommendation convincing, and has started to share the information with similar patients&#8211;which means I also benefit from what she learns from others.</p>
<p>- I fixed my complexion, have nearly fixed my weight issues, and reversed dozens of nagging health issues (peeling fingernails, bad breath, rosacea flushing, random bad stomachaches, food sensitivities, mood swings, lack of motivation and focus etc.) through a whole-body thyroid/adrenal/gut repair approach that&#8217;s considered bunk by most mainstream endocrinologists. Parts of this approach happen to incorporate things you&#8217;ve found beneficial&#8211;increased amounts of animal fat, fermented foods, focus on optimal sleep, focus on aligning with circadian rhythms. (Interestingly, one of leading proponents of this approach started out focusing on thyroid health and has found even better results by broadening his focus to brain health&#8230;.very much like your &#8220;what&#8217;s good for the brain is good for the body.&#8221;)</p>
<p>FWIW, I tend to use topics you&#8217;ve investigated as a check on other people&#8217;s recommendations&#8211;you&#8217;re not an &#8220;expert&#8221; in the field of thyroid repair, or gut health, etc., so you have no incentives to adhere or not adhere to a particular line of thinking. So if both you and a thyroid doctor find a particular approach beneficial, that seems very convincing to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those are good lessons. Tomorrow I will explain why I think they all come from one somewhat hidden underlying lesson.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ed Rickards, a retired lawyer and journalist, writes <a href="http://dukecheck.com/" target="_blank">Duke Check</a>, a blog about Duke University, which I enjoy reading even though I have no connection with Duke. It emphasizes scandals and bad governance but also <a href="http://dukecheck.com/?p=16535" target="_blank">praises</a>. He started it in 2009. There have been plenty of scandals since then, including <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57376073/deception-at-duke-fraud-in-cancer-care/" target="_blank">the Anil Potti cancer research fraud</a>.</p>
<p>I recently asked him a few questions.<span id="more-11630"></span></p>
<p><strong>Why did you start Duke Check?</strong></p>
<p>I started DukeCheck &#8212; originally Duke Fact Checker &#8212; because of a lack of transparency and accountability on the part of the school&#8217;s administration. You may want to review <a href="http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2011/10/25/fact-checker-story-universitys-unorthodox-critic" target="_blank">this Chronicle profile</a>, especially the comments from the late law professor John (Jack) Johnston, about the need for such a column and my goals. I want to provide stakeholders in Duke &#8212; students, parents, faculty, alumni, workers, everyone &#8212; with the information so that they can participate and have their thoughts count. I really do not care if they agree with me or not, just so long as they step forward.</p>
<p><strong>After you graduated from Duke, did you have further association with the school (e.g., worked there)?</strong></p>
<p>I graduated from Duke 1963 and Duke Law 1966.  No, I never worked for Duke or had any relationship other than alum. I continued to stay in touch, I wrote various letters about my feelings, but the internet is what opened it all up. and made it possible for me to write my blog from either NY (where I used to live) or Coconut Grove (dead of the winter).  I have recently closed up NY and live near Princeton NJ . . . on a golf course which is a big switch.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever been a professional writer?</strong></p>
<p>After brief flirtation with the law, and a job in private equity that was totally boring, I returned to my first love, Journalism, which attracted me while I was in college, and also during the summers when I worked for a local daily newspaper in my hometown.  I have worked at the Associated Press, ABC, CBS and NBC, so I have been all around!</p>
<p><strong>[This makes Duke Check a super-hobby -- combining the freedom of a hobby with the skills of a professional. This blog, too, is a super-hobby.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Duke has just opened a campus in China, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunshan" target="_blank">Kunshan</a>, which is near Shanghai. The campus is called Duke Kunshan University (DKU). Does the DKU story point to/illustrate any general lesson(s)?</strong></p>
<p>The DKU story will end with an empty campus in Kunshan. Many colleges have hit brick walls with their international adventures and this will be another. 15 years ago, Duke was gung-ho to open in Frankfurt; our president at the time, Nan Keohane, held an international news conference linked by satellite with reporters asking questions in Durham, NY, and Frankfurt.  Six years, $15 to 20 million later, it died.</p>
<p>Duke should pursue international opportunities; but trying to export bricks and mortar to China will not fly. For one thing, academic freedom is a very strong tradition at Duke, and no Chinese leader will tolerate it. The new campus cannot teach nor allow religious services. We were founded by Quakers and Methodists.</p>
<p>We also see our administration going overboard on finances. At a time when money is tight, unbelievably tight, we&#8217;re exporting green like mad. The numbers do not add up: number of students, amount we can charge them. This may well be the first thing to implode, academic freedom the 2nd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What surprised me most about <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=7671" target="_blank">my self-experimental discoveries</a> was that they were outside my area of expertise (animal learning). I discovered how to sleep better but I&#8217;m not a sleep researcher. I discovered <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/morning-faces-therapy-resources/" target="_blank">how to improve my mood</a> but I&#8217;m not a mood researcher. I discovered that flaxseed oil improved brain function but I&#8217;m not a nutrition researcher. And so on. This is <strong></strong>not supposed to happen. Chemistry professors are not supposed to advance physics.  Long ago, this rule was broken. Mendel was not a biologist, Wegener (continental drift) was not a geologist. It hasn&#8217;t been broken in the last 100 years. As knowledge increases, the &#8220;gains due to specialization&#8221; &#8212; the advantage of specialists over everyone else within their area of expertise &#8212; is supposed to increase. The advantage, and its growth, seem inevitable. It occurs, say economists, because specialized knowledge (e.g., what physicists know that the rest of us, including chemists, don&#8217;t know) increases. <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf" target="_blank">My theory of human evolution</a> centers on the idea that humans have evolved to specialize and trade. In my life I use thousands of things made by specialists that <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html" target="_blank">I couldn&#8217;t begin to make myself</a>.</p>
<p>Here we have two things. 1. A general rule (specialists have a big advantage, within their specialty, over the rest of us) that is overwhelmingly true. 2. An exception (my work). How can this be explained? What can we learn from it? I&#8217;ve <a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf" target="_blank">tried to answer these questions</a> but I can add to what I said in that paper. The power of specialization is clearly enormous. Adam Smith, who called specialization &#8220;division of labor&#8221;, was right. The existence of an exception to the general rule suggests  there are forces pushing in the opposite direction (toward specialists being <strong>worse</strong> than the rest of us in their area of expertise) that can be more powerful than the power of specialization. Given the power of specialization, the countervailing forces must be remarkably strong. Can we learn more about them? Can we harness them? Can we increase them? The power of specialization has been increasing for thousands of years. How strong the countervailing forces may become is unclear.</p>
<p>The more you&#8217;ve read this blog, the more you know what I think the countervailing forces are. Some of them weaken specialists: 1. Professors prefer to be useless rather than useful (Veblen).  2. A large fraction (99%?) of health care workers have no interest in remedies that do not allow them to make money. 3. Medical school professors are terrible scientists. 4. Restrictions on research. Some of them strengthen the rest of us: 1. Data storage and analysis have become very cheap. 2. It is easier for non-scientists to read the scientific literature. 3. No one cares more about your health than you. These are examples. The list could be much longer. What&#8217;s interesting is not the critique of health care, which is pretty obvious, but the apparent power of these forces, which isn&#8217;t obvious at all.</p>
<p>I want to learn more about this. I want learn how to use these opposing forces and, if possible, increase them. One way to do this is find more exceptions to the general rule, that is, find more people who have improved their health beyond expert advice. I have <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/make-yourself-healthy/" target="_blank">found some examples</a>. To find more, to learn more about them, and to encourage this sort of thing (DIY Health), I offer the opportunity to guest-blog here.</p>
<p>I think the fundamental reason you can improve on what health experts tell you is that you can gather data. Health experts have weakened their position by ignoring vast amounts of data. Three kinds of data are helpful:  (a) other people&#8217;s experiences, (b) scientific papers and (c) self-measurement (combined with self-experimentation). No doubt (c) is the hardest to collect and the most powerful. I would like to offer one or more people the opportunity to guest-blog here about what happens when they try to do (c). In plain English, I am looking for people who are measuring a health problem  and trying to improve on expert advice. For example, trying to lower blood pressure without taking blood pressure medicine. Or counting pimples to figure out what&#8217;s causing your acne. Or measuring your mood to test alternatives to anti-depressants. I don&#8217;t care what&#8217;s measured, so long as it is health-related. (Exception: no weight-loss stories) and you approach these measurements with an open mind (e.g., not trying to promote some product or theory). I am not trying to collect success stories. I am trying to find out what happens when people take this approach.</p>
<p>Guest-blogging may increase your motivation, push you to think more (&#8220;<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/22/is-it-time-to-revise-ancient-philosophical-questions/" target="_blank">I blog, therefore I think</a>&#8220;) and give you access to the collective wisdom of readers of this blog (in the comments). If guest-blogging about your experiences and progress (or lack of it) might interest you, contact me with details of what you are doing or plan to do.</p>

Except that none of it was [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Clinton was President, Ryan Holiday writes in <strong>Trust Me I&#8217;m Lying</strong> (copy sent me by publisher, Ryan is a friend),</p>
<blockquote><p>[Matt] Drudge accused prominent journalist and Clinton adviser Sidney  Blumenhthal of a shocking history of spousal abuse &#8212; and one covered up by the White House, no less. Except that none of it was true. . . . An anonymous Republican source had whispered into Drudge&#8217;s ear to settle a political score against Blumenthal. . . . [Drudge] refused to apologize for the pain caused by his recklessness.</p></blockquote>
<p>In spite of knowing this, I still read Matt Drudge. I don&#8217;t have to. There are a zillion other things to read. That may or may not make me a horrible person but it illustrates the depth of the problem that Ryan writes about: <strong>Spreading lies pays</strong>.</p>
<p>A more mundane example is press releases. Bloggers love press releases, Ryan says (speaking from experience working at American Apparel). All the work is done for them. So what if press releases are profoundly dishonest in the way they present a half truth (positive stuff about the product) as if it is a whole truth? It&#8217;s an easy way to get a few thousand clicks. &#8220;I recall sending e-mails to <em>Gawker</em> and <em>Jezebel</em> on several occasions over matters of factual errors and not receiving a response,&#8221; writes Ryan. &#8220;My anonymous tips seem to arrive in their inboxes just fine &#8212; it&#8217;s the signed corrections that run into issues.&#8221; A car site published a rumor that turned out to be false. A friend of Ryan&#8217;s complained that the headline wasn&#8217;t fixed:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Ryan's friend:] Why keep the headline up since we now know it&#8217;s not true?<br />
[Car site:] You guys are so funny.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taking the headline down would generate fewer clicks than leaving it up. Shameless.</p>
<p>&#8220;That way lies madness,&#8221; I told a friend who worried about how much traffic his blog attracted. Bloggers who will do anything for a click do so, of course, because their salary depends on it, whereas my friend did not get significant income from his blog. Sure, paying bloggers by the click pushes them to write stuff that people want to read &#8212; which sounds good, aren&#8217;t snobs bad? &#8212; except what if people don&#8217;t care that much about the truth?</p>
<p>I think of science. Who do professional scientists more closely resemble? 1. Bloggers who will do anything for a click. 2. Disinterested seekers of truth. Well, it&#8217;s a job, not a hobby. Science and job are not a good fit (<a href="http://media.sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf">as I&#8217;ve written</a>), just as factory food and health are not a good fit. We can see the consequences of the bad fit between factory food and health in the obesity epidemic (which I believe is caused by eating calorie-dense quickly-digested food that tastes exactly the same each time &#8212; factory food is much more standardized than food you make yourself) and the epidemic of digestive problems (caused by too-sterile food &#8212; factory food is more sterile than food you make yourself). We can see the consequences of the bad fit between science and job in the failure to find solutions to one growing problem after another (obesity, Crohn&#8217;s disease, autism, depression, poor sleep, etc.). <em>Trust Me I&#8217;m Lying</em> is about the consequences of the poor fit between being paid by the click and caring about the truth of what you write.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A blog called <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/">Adventures in Nutritional Therapy</a> (started March 2011) is about what the author learned while trying to solve her health problems via nutrition and a few other things. She usually assumed her health problems were due to too much or too little of some nutrient. She puts it like this: &#8220;using mostly non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) supplements and treatments to address depression, brain fog, insomnia, migraines, hypothyroidism, restless legs, carpal tunnel syndrome, and a bunch of other annoyances.&#8221; In contrast to what &#8220;the American medical establishment&#8221; advises. Mostly it is nutritional self-experimentation about a wide range of health problems.</p>
<p>Interesting things I learned from the archives:</p>
<p>1. Question: Did Lance Armstrong take performance-enhancing drugs? I learned that LiveStrong (Armstrong&#8217;s site) is a content farm. Now answer that question again.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;If you return repeatedly to a conventional doctor with a problem they can’t solve, they will eventually suggest you need antidepressants.&#8221;</p>
<p>3.  &#8220;When I mentioned [to Dr. CFS] the mild success I’d had with zinc, he said it was in my mind: I wanted it to work and it did. When I pointed out that 70% of the things I tried didn’t work, he changed the subject. Dr. CFS’ lack of basic reasoning skills did nothing to rebuild my confidence in the health care system.&#8221; Quite right. I have had the same experience. Most things I tried failed. When something finally worked, it could hardly be a placebo effect. This line of reasoning has been difficult for some supposedly smart people to grasp.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/04/the-story-of-the-end-of-my-depression/">A list of things that helped her with depression</a>. &#8220;Quit gluten&#8221; is number one.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">Pepsi caused her to get acne</a>. Same here.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">100 mg/day of iron caused terrible acne</a> that persisted for weeks after she stopped taking the iron.</p>
<p>7. &#8220;<a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/08/abdominal-pain/">In September 2008</a> I started a journey that serves as a good example of the limits of the American health care system, where you can go through three months, 15 doctor visits, $7,000 in medical tests, three prescriptions and five over-the-counter medications trying to treat your abdominal pain, and after you lose ten pounds due to said pain, you are asked by the “specialists” if you have an eating disorder.&#8221; I agree. Also an example of the inability of people within the American health care system to see those limits.  If they recognized that people outside their belief system might have something valuable to contribute, apparently something awful would happen.</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/07/six-weeks-of-sciatica/">Acupuncture relieved her sciatica</a>, but not for long. &#8220;By the time I left [the acupuncturist's office] the pain was gone, but it crept back during my 30-minute drive home.&#8221;</p>
<p>9. Pointing out many wrongs does not equal a right. She praises <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/09/sugar-bitter-pill-video/">a talk by Robert Lustig</a> about evil fructose. I am quite sure that fructose (by itself) did not cause the obesity epidemic. For one thing, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I lost a lot of weight by drinking it</a>. (<a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">Here is an advanced discussion</a>.) In other words, being a good critic of other people&#8217;s work (as Lustig may be) doesn&#8217;t get you very far. I think it is hard for non-scientists (and even some scientists) to understand that all scientific work has dozens of &#8220;flaws&#8221;. Pointing out the flaws in this or that is little help, unless those flaws haven&#8217;t been noticed. What usually helps isn&#8217;t seeing flaws, it is seeing what can be learned.</p>
<p>10. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/06/headaches-and-migraines/">A list of what caused headaches and migraines</a>. One was MSG. Another was Vitamin D3, because it made her Vitamin B1 level too low.</p>
<p>She is a good writer. Mostly I found support for my beliefs: 1. Of the two aspects of self-experimentation (measure, change),  change is more powerful. She does little or no self-tracking  (= keeping records) as far as I could tell, yet has made a lot of progress. She has done a huge amount of trying different things. 2. Nutritional deficiencies cause a lot of problems. 3. Fermented food is overlooked. She never tries it, in spite of major digestive problems. She does try probiotics. 4. American health care is exceedingly messed-up. As she puts it, &#8220;the American medical establishment has no interest in this approach [which often helped her] and, when they do deign to discuss it, don&#8217;t know what the #%@! they&#8217;re talking about.&#8221; 5. &#8220;Over the years I&#8217;ve found accounts of personal experiences to be very helpful.&#8221; I agree. Her blog and mine are full of them.</p>
<p>Thanks to Alexandra Carmichael.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/12/self-experimenters-scientific-american/">Her latest post</a> mentions me (&#8220;The fella after my own heart is Seth Roberts, who after ten years of experimenting . . . &#8220;). I was unaware of that when I wrote the above.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/blog/">Andrew Gelman&#8217;s blog</a> has lasted longer than this blog (and <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2005/03/learning_from_s.html">was responsible for this blog</a>.) Recently <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2010/01/a_half-decade_o.html">Andrew looked back</a>. It seemed like a good idea so I will follow his lead.</p>
<p>The two big surprises have been how easy it is and how helpful it is. In the beginning it wasn&#8217;t easy to find interesting things to say. Somehow it got easier and easier. Partly because I had more ideas &#8212; about omega-3, the umami hypothesis and fermented foods, the effect of animal fat on sleep. Partly because readers sent me interesting stuff. Partly because I started teaching at Tsinghua and moved to Beijing part of the year. Partly because the Shangri-La Diet produced results that I wanted to brag about. And &#8212; a very big part of it &#8212; because there are enough comments here and elsewhere to make me think people are reading it. I think everyone has an innate desire to be listened to. As our concerns and knowledge become more and more specialized, it becomes harder and harder to find an audience. When <em>Spy </em>magazine was around I read every issue three times. I was dying to talk about it with other fans. I couldn&#8217;t. I couldn&#8217;t find them.</p>
<p>Some of the stuff people have sent me has been incredibly helpful. Most of the examples involve trying my ideas. Taking omega-3 (via flaxseed oil or fish oil). <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/07/todays-happines.html">Tyler Cowen&#8217;s experience</a>, for example. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/02/16/omega-3-and-arithmetic/">Tim Lundeen&#8217;s results</a>. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/">The effect on sports injuries</a>. Or eating more fermented food. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/02/26/i-started-eating-more-fermented-food/">Tucker Max&#8217;s experience</a>. Not only does it make the whole subject much easier to talk about, it convinces me I&#8217;m on the right track. Some of the examples involve telling me about other more conventional data related to my ideas. For example, I&#8217;m very glad to know about <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/05/12/the-dose-response-revolution-and-fermented-food/">hormesis</a>, which supports my ideas about fermented food. Knowing about radiation hormesis makes me <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/09/16/how-dangerous-are-cell-phones/">stop worrying about the small dose of radiation I get from my cell phone</a>. The <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/12/13/interview-with-seth-roberts/#comment-372948">recent comment</a> about two morning faces being better than one might turn out to be really helpful and important.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Stoops_to_Conquer"><em>She Stoops to Conquer</em></a>, an 18th century play, but the title is brilliant. My self-experimenation, I now think, had a dose of that because I was willing to do something as humble as study myself whereas most scientists wouldn&#8217;t stoop to that. Too low-status. Blogging has a lot of that. How many Berkeley professors blog? Uh, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/">Brad DeLong</a>? And someone else, rarely. Blogging is beneath them. Whereas half of Tsinghua students have blogs. They aren&#8217;t worried about appearing undignified. The phrase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses"><em>keeping up with the Joneses</em></a> means your car has to be at least as expensive as your neighbor&#8217;s car, and so on. A kind of arms race. Such an arms race goes on in science: What you must do to appear high status takes up more and more of your resources, leaving less and less to actually make progress. So less and less progress is made. Self-experimentation breaks out of that vicious cycle. Blogging is the same thing more generally. Supposedly professors, especially at a place like Berkeley, have interesting things to say. But the demands of status, as Veblen described in the last chapter of <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper/VEBLEN/veblenhp.html"><em>The Theory of the Leisure Class</em></a>, make it harder and harder for them to say them. Blogging breaks out of <em>that </em>vicious cycle.</p>
<p>When I taught introductory psychology I found I could often weave whatever I&#8217;d been thinking about into my next lecture. It&#8217;s good to start a lecture by saying &#8220;Something interesting happened to me a few days ago . . . &#8221; Now I can just blog about it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google &#8220;Climategate&#8221; you get 31 million hits. &#8220;Obama&#8221; returns 40 million. Yet mainstream media, such as the <em>New York Times</em>, have said little about it. <em>The New Yorker</em> has said nothing about it. Given so much interest, that will change.</p>
<p>Some of my prior beliefs &#8212; that empirical support for the view that man has caused global warming is weaker than we&#8217;re told, that bloggers are a powerful force for truth &#8212; are stronger. But here are a few things I didn&#8217;t think of until now:</p>
<p>1. <strong>The truth leaks out before it gushes out</strong>. <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/12/03/the-parable-of-the-childrens-book/">Laurie David&#8217;s children&#8217;s book</a> &#8212; its egregious mistake, her blithe dismissal of that mistake &#8212; is an example of the truth leaking out. In the Ranjit Chandra case, little facts implied he was a fraud long before this became utterly clear. An example is the claim in one of his papers (published in <em>The Lancet</em>!) that everyone asked agreed to be in his experiment.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Teaching is even better done via scandals than via stories</strong>. The number of hits for Climategate is an indication of how much people are learning from it. As I blogged earlier,<a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/12/02/climategate-its-educational-value/"> they&#8217;re learning a lot about science</a>. A mere story about science would never attract so much attention. I should think more about how to use scandals to teach stuff. When Nassim Taleb is scathing about this or that, he has the right idea. <em>Spy</em> was the perfect example. It taught me a lot about New York City.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Jane Jacobs was wrong</strong>. Or at least missed something very important. In <em>Dark Age Ahead, </em>her last book, she pointed to a number of disturbing signs. One was the rise of crappy science. She was quite right about thatÂ  &#8212; as scientists have become more professional they have become more status-oriented and less truth-oriented. She didn&#8217;t foresee that the Internet would be an enormously powerful corrective force, as is happening now. Climategate is a (relatively) small example of even bigger force: the rise of the power of sophisticated amateurs/hobbyists. Who, unlike professionals, with jobs and status to protect, have complete freedom. The first big example was printed non-fiction books, <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/12/02/climategate-its-educational-value/">as I blogged earlier</a> (which are written with great freedom, usually); but now the Internet provides another great outlet, much faster, cheaper, and more accessible than books, for independent thought.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s exactly the driving force behind blogging.</p>
<p>I used to teach introductory psychology. Large lecture class. I found I could often put whatever I was thinking about in the morning into my lecture. Blogging is easier.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> <a href="http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/002845.html">Jonathan Schwarz</a> puts it like this: We have &#8220;desperation to express what our existence is like. Sometimes this comes out literally as singing, sometimes metaphorically.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/12/24/charles-nemeroff-under-scrutiny/">On Christmas Eve</a> I wrote there was a lot to be learned from the web comments on newspaper articles and the like that anyone can post. My point was how wonderful this was. Now the <em>New York Times</em> has added a feature that allows the most popular comments to rise to the top (you &#8220;show&#8221; Readers&#8217; Recommendations) <a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2009/01/11/vaccine-safety-a-debate/">as I hoped</a>. <a href="http://community.nytimes.com/article/comments/2009/01/22/opinion/22qaddafi.html?s=3">For example</a>. Way to go!</p>
<p>You can also find comments that the &#8220;editors&#8221; (the sub-sub editors?) recommend (show Editors&#8217; Selections). They tend to be long and querulous. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be using that feature much but it is good to have it for when I want long and querulous.</p>
<p><em>Still </em>no comments allowed on <em>The New Yorker</em> website.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alana Taylor, a journalism student at NYU, blogged about one of her classes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Quigley [the teacher] tells us we have to remember to bring in the hard copy of the New York Times every week. I take a deep sigh. Every single journalism class at <span class="caps">NYU </span>has required me to bring the bulky newspaper. I don&#8217;t understand why they don&#8217;t let us access the online version, get our current events news from other outlets, or even use our <span class="caps">NYT</span>imes app on the iPhone. Bringing the New York Times pains me because I refuse to believe that it&#8217;s the only source for credible news or Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism and it&#8217;s a big waste of trees. . . I am taking the only old-but-new-but-still-old media class in the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. The same thing goes on all over campus where students are required to buy a heavy glossy textbook that costs about a semester of paper <em>New York Times. </em>As if the same info wasn&#8217;t free on the Web.</p>
<p>Long ago, textbooks were a fantastic bargain because they cost so much less than private tutors. And private tutors disappeared.</p>
<p>After Taylor&#8217;s unflattering piece, her thin-skinned professor, who had said &#8220;it&#8217;s essential for journalists to blog&#8221;, banned blogging about the class.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In November, a Tsinghua undergraduate killed herself by jumping out of a building. She kept a blog. After her death, a friend of mine read her blog &#8212; as did a few thousand other people &#8212; and told me it was full of sadness. My friend, a Tsinghua student, was puzzled that the friends and family of the dead girl had read her blog and done nothing. Will you translate some of it for me? I asked my friend (who translates other things for me). She begged off. I was puzzled: Surely the girl had wanted others to read what she had written, I thought.<br />
I found another translator. After a few minutes of translation I had to stop: It was unbearably sad, maybe the saddest writing I&#8217;ve ever come across. I could see why my friend didn&#8217;t want to translate it.</p>
<p>Here is one entry. It takes the form of a questionnaire:</p>
<blockquote><p>Question 1: Which student phase [primary school, middle school, high school, college] do you miss the most?</p>
<p>Answer: High school. Get together with a lot of friends. I know where I should go, even if it turns out to be wrong.</p>
<p>Question 2: Talk about your current life.</p>
<p>Answer: Listless. Feel half asleep. Do not want to wake up. I want to kill the people who wake me up. I love this world. I live for my goal.</p>
<p>Question 3: Do you have dreams? What are they?</p>
<p>Answer: I have many dreams. Make a movie . . . performance art [she was an art major]. <span class="nfakPe" /><span class="nfakPe" /><span class="nfakPe">Her [she was ga</span>y]. Forgive me. Dream this day will come. Believe.</p>
<p>Question 4: Which kind of friend do you like best?</p>
<p>Answer: Any kind is fine. Understanding me a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Question 5: Could you give up going back to your hometown to be with your parents, to be with your lover?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>Question 6: What do you most want to do right now?<br />
Answer: Sleep, dream. Find <span class="nfakPe">her</span>. Just dream, do not want to meet anyone.</p>
<p>Question 7: Up until now, what is your happiest event?</p>
<p>Answer: I didn&#8217;t lose my past.</p>
<p>p.s. I don&#8217;t want any blessing. [A custom/game among Chinese teenagers is that after you answer a few questions you are "blessed" by your questioner.] Wish everyone happiness. Don&#8217;t ask me these boring questions again.</p></blockquote>
<p>News of the girl&#8217;s death was posted on the student forums. What was the response? I asked my friend. Most of the comments were &#8220;Bless,&#8221; she said. The English word <em>bless</em>. That&#8217;s a customary thing to say when you learn someone has died.</p>
