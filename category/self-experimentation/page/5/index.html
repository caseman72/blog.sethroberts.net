					<p>At Thursday&#8217;s Quantified Self Silicon Valley Meetup (where I gave a talk called <a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-11-QS-plus-Paleo-what.ppt">QS + Paleo = ?</a>), Alexandra Carmichael introduced herself with the three words &#8220;no&#8221;, &#8220;headache&#8221;, and &#8220;today&#8221;. About five days earlier, she had started having migraine headaches every day. Before that, she hadn&#8217;t had a migraine headache in a year. After the headaches began, her husband, having read <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html">my Boing Boing story</a> (about a woman whose migraines were mostly from cleaning products), suggested that her headaches might be caused by the <a href="http://www.febreze.com/">Febreze</a> they had just started using. They stopped using it. Because it can linger in carpets, etc., they cleaned their whole apartment with vinegar and baking soda, to get rid of all traces. That&#8217;s when Alexandra&#8217;s headaches stopped. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/08/13/more-migraine-headaches-caused-by-cleaning-products/#more-3728" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Tuesday, August 9th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/03/08/top-and-bottom-versus-middle/">My explanation of the Ten Commandments</a> is that someone at the top (Moses) was trying to convince people at the bottom to join him. People at the bottom were being preyed upon. &#8220;Thou shalt not steal&#8221; meant, to Moses&#8217;s audience, &#8220;no one will steal from you &#8212; or at least we, your leaders, will discourage it.&#8221; At the very beginning of <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp">the Code of Hammarabi</a>, another ancient set of rules, it says one purpose of the rules is &#8220;so that the strong will not harm the weak&#8221;.</p>
<p>I keep seeing this pattern &#8212; people at or near the top of the hierarchy making common cause with people on the bottom against people in the middle. I was reminded of it by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/world/asia/08china.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One anecdote described a Hu Yaobang [top Chinese leader] visit that Mr. Wen arranged with Guizhou Province villagers — secretly, he wrote, because Hu Yaobang did not trust local leaders to let them speak freely.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s, the U.S. civil rights movement gained considerable force and accomplishment when the very top of the government (first, President Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy, later President Johnson) weighed in on the side of the protesters (bottom) against the various state governments (middle).</p>
<p>The practical value of this alignment of forces is illustrated by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Walk-School-Neighborhood-Renaissance/dp/1442200006">How to Walk to School</a>, a book about school reform (which I reviewed <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/03/08/top-and-bottom-versus-middle/">here</a>). Two mothers of young children, Jacqueline Edelberg and another woman, wanted to improve their neighborhood schools before it was too late for their own children to benefit. On the face of it, this was impossible. But they found common cause with the principal of a local school (Susan Kurland). It goes unmentioned in the book but my impression, reading between the lines, is that the main thing that happened is that the worst teachers were shamed into leaving, above all by parents sitting in their classrooms. The principal alone could do nothing about terrible teachers; the parents alone could do nothing; together they did a lot. I spoke to Edelberg about this and she agreed with me.</p>
<p>I point out this pattern because it works. Judaism (Moses) still exists; people still read the Old Testament. Even more powerfully, all governments have lists of laws (Hammurabi). Jacqueline Edelberg&#8217;s neighborhood school is much better. The next big revolution in human affairs, I believe, will be health care. The current system, in which people pay vast amounts for drugs that barely work, have awful side effects, and leave intact the root cause (e.g., too little dietary omega-3), will be replaced by a much better system. The much better system will be some version of paleo. As <a href="http://www.workoutconditioning.com/?p=1072">Woody Allen predicted</a>, people will come to believe that butter is health food. </p>
<p>How will it happen? I suspect this pattern will be the driving force. People at the top and people at the bottom will put pressure on people in the middle. Self-experimentation, self-quantification, and personal science (which overlap greatly) are tools of people at the bottom. They cost nothing, they are available to all. When you track (quantify and record) your health problem, and show your doctor, via numbers and graphs, that the drug he prescribed didn&#8217;t work, that puts pressure on him. When you bring your doctor numbers and graphs that show a paleo solution did work, that puts even more pressure on him. The point, if it isn&#8217;t obvious, is that numbers and graphs, based on carefully collected day-after-day data, amplify what one person can do. Not just what they can learn, not just how healthy they can be, but how much they can influence others. And this amplification of influence, which I never discuss, may ultimately be the most important.</p>

					<p>Nowadays, far more than ever before, people can do useful science (collect data, draw conclusions) about their own health. This personal science can produce much better results than expert advice. For example, I found ways to sleep better and raise my mood superior to what sleep and mood experts know. I wonder how others are using this new power. This is why I wrote a story for Boing Boing about <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html">a woman (Sarah) who figured out what caused her migraines</a> after conventional doctors failed to help her. She was eventually helped by an expert (a naturopath) but most of the improvement came from self-experimentation showing that cleaning and skin care products caused migraines.</p>
<p>The story got many comments. A surprising number were eerily dismissive. You might think it was a good thing that Sarah got rid of frequent crippling migraines after doctors failed to. Nope: &#8220;Anecdotes are not data&#8221; (56 likes).  The same person also said &#8220;data is data&#8221;. Both are examples of <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/05/12/preventive-stupidity-exists/">preventive stupidity</a>. &#8220;Big Brother loves you,&#8221; replied Mark Frauenfelder, and I agree. Another surprising comment was &#8220;Don&#8217;t encourage these people&#8221; (= people like Sarah). One of the <em>dismissista</em>s came to his senses. &#8220;I&#8217;d simply like to close with an apology, as on reflection little I&#8217;ve posted here has been useful or expansive,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Some comments nicely summed up the main points of the story. &#8220;When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&#8221; was a good description of Sarah&#8217;s conventional doctors. They acted as if their only tool was the ability to write prescriptions &#8212; so every problem called for a prescription. When the first 10 drugs didn&#8217;t work, they tried more drugs. When the first 30 drugs didn&#8217;t work, they tried more drugs. Surely this is bad medicine, yet, as far as I can tell, that&#8217;s what they learn to do.</p>
<p>Some comments asked questions it would have helped if I had anticipated. How could Sarah have tried 50 different migraine drugs and 13 different birth control pills in one year? I wasn&#8217;t puzzled by this but details would have clarified things.</p>
<p>Above all, the comments supported my belief that Sarah&#8217;s problem was common. Many commenters said they had migraines caused by environmental triggers. Only one said his migraines turned out to be caused by a tumor. In spite of this pattern of causality, the comments also suggested that conventional doctors generally prescribe drugs for migraines. (&#8220;They had the prescription typed into the system before I was even finished telling them what was going on.&#8221;) It&#8217;s like trying to enter a room by breaking through a wall (prescribing a drug) instead of using the door (finding the triggers). It&#8217;s as if all they have is a sledgehammer.</p>

				<small>Saturday, July 30th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Last night I slept unusually well, waking up more rested and with more energy than usual.  I slept longer than usual: 7.0 hours versus my usual 5.1 hours (median of the previous 20 days).  My rating of how rested I felt was 99.2% (that is, 99.2% of fully rested); the median of the previous 20 days is 98.8%. Because the maximum is 100%, this is really a comparison of 0.8% (this morning) with 1.2% (previous mornings); and the comparison is not adjusted for the number of times I stood on one leg to exhaustion, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/22/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">which improves this rating</a>. During the previous 20 days I often stood on one leg to exhaustion six times; yesterday I only did it four times. Above all, I felt more energy in the morning. This was obvious. I have just started to measure this.  At 8 am and 9 am, I rate my energy on a 0-100 scale where 50 = neither sluggish nor energetic/energized, 60 = slightly energetic/energized, 70 = somewhat energetic/energized, and 75 = energetic/energized. My ratings this morning were 73 (8 am) and 74 (9 am). The median of my 9 previous ratings is 62. The energy improvement (73/74 vs 62) is why I am curious. I would like to feel this way every morning.</p>
<p>What caused it? I had not exercised the previous day. My room was no darker than usual. My flaxseed oil intake was no different than usual. I had not <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2009/10/31/effect-of-animal-fat-on-sleep-more/">eaten more pork fat than usual</a>. However, four things had been different than usual:</p>
<p>1. <strong>2 tablespoons of butter at lunch</strong>. In addition to my usual 4 tablespoons per day.</p>
<p>2. <strong>0.5-1 tablespoons of butter at bedtime</strong>. Again, in addition the usual 4.</p>
<p>3. <strong>1 tablespoon (15 g) coconut butter at bedtime</strong>. Part of a longer study of the effect of coconut butter. Gary Taubes suggested this. I had eaten 1 T coconut butter at bedtime 13 previous days. On the first of those 13 days, I <em>had</em> felt a lot more energetic than usual in the morning. On the remaining days, however, the improvement was less clear. I started measuring how energetic I felt in the morning to study this further. Last night was Friday night. On the previous two nights (Wednesday and Thursday) I had not eaten the coconut butter. Maybe absence of coconut butter followed by resumption of coconut butter is the cause.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Fresh air and ambient noise</strong>. Following a friend&#8217;s suggestion, I opened one of my bedroom windows.</p>
<p>My first question is whether the improvement is repeatable. If so, I will start to vary these four factors.</p>

					<p>Please read <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html">my story at Boing Boing</a> about how a woman figured out what caused her migraines. I am always interested in cases where people figure out for themselves how to be healthy. If you have a story like that please contact me.</p>
<p>It has generated a lot of comments. Mark Frauenfelder, who posted it, told me he knew it would generate a lot of comments and one of the first would be &#8220;anecdotes are not data&#8221;. He was right. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/05/12/preventive-stupidity-exists/">Preventive stupidity</a> in action. It tells you something that <em>scientists</em> teach that &#8220;anecdotes are not data&#8221;, when all major scientific truths, as far as I know, began with a single observation. For example, the discovery of electricity began with a single observation that a dead frog&#8217;s leg twitched when touched with a scalpel. Why is something so at odds with reality taught and repeated by scientists, whose job is paying attention to reality? My explanation is human nature: How much we enjoy feeling superior.</p>

				<small>Monday, July 25th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/19brody.html?pagewanted=all">A new longitudinal study</a> finds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite conventional advice to eat less fat, <strong>weight loss was greatest among people who ate more yogurt and nuts, including peanut butter</strong>, over each four-year period. . . .</p>
<p>That yogurt, among all foods, was most strongly linked to weight loss was the study’s most surprising dietary finding, the researchers said. Participants who ate more yogurt [than the average for all participants?] lost an average of 0.82 pound every four years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why might this be? </p>
<p>Yogurt and peanut butter are both unusual foods. Yogurt is strange because unflavored yogurt has little or no smell. It tastes good for other reasons: strong sourness, creaminess, and coolness. People are also pushed to eat it not only by how pleasant it is to eat but by the thought that it is good for them. Most foods, in the form that we eat them, have a smell. I explain the yogurt results by saying that yogurt consumption replaced consumption of foods with stronger smells.</p>
<p>Peanut butter is unusual because when I was visiting publishers to sell <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>, I met a woman who told me she had lost weight simply by eating peanut butter &#8212; that is, by adding peanut butter to the rest of her diet, making no other changes. I think she ate about 3 tablespoons per day. This predisposed her to think there might be something to my ideas. No one has ever told me such a story about another food. If peanut butter has a smell, it&#8217;s really weak. It&#8217;s pleasant to eat because of fat content and texture. When I was a boy, my mom made me peanut butter sandwiches (no jam) for school lunch. I never came to like them. This implies I never learned a smell-calorie association. The bread must have supplied a strong fast calorie signal so this implies that the peanut butter generated little or no smell signal.</p>

				<small>Sunday, July 24th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I am pleased by <a href="http://ihaveneverdonethisbefore.com/2011/07/21/two-successful-dietary-experiments/">these results</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After a possibly overzealous dentist told me I need a gum graft [which <a href="http://www.experienceproject.com/stories/Had-A-Gum-Graft/250104">may cost $3000</a>], my husband encouraged me to start taking flaxseed oil. A few people online have <a href="../2011/03/03/root-planing-cancelled/">reported</a> that flaxseed oil dramatically improved their gum health, and we figured it was worth a shot.</p>
<p><strong>My initial dose of flaxseed oil was two tablespoons a day</strong>, and<strong> my gums stopped bleeding and hurting within three days</strong>. This is pretty huge for me, because <strong>my gums have been bleeding since I was in junior high</strong>. [Emphasis added.] At the same time, I added using a Sonicare toothbrush and flossing a little more vigorously. Considering that I had tried these things in the past without the flaxseed oil and they only made me bleed more, I feel like the flaxseed oil is the difference maker.</p>
<p>I have subsequently reduced my flaxseed oil dose to one tablespoon, which I feel is more appropriate for a woman my size. I haven’t gained any weight from the flaxseed oil, which was a bit of a surprise. Taking it in the morning seems to help curb my appetite by at least the 130 calories it consumes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The online reports she mentions are from this blog. A recap: <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2006/07/05/brain-food/">Because of the Shangri-La Diet</a>, one evening I took four or five flaxseed oil capsules. The next morning, I was surprised to notice that putting on my shoes standing up, which I&#8217;d done hundreds of times, was much easier than usual. This suggested that the flaxseed oil had improved my balance. I started to carefully measure my balance and varied my flaxseed oil intake. My measurements showed that variations in amount of flaxseed oil really did affect my balance. They also suggested the best dose. My balance improved up to a dose of 3 tablespoons/day of flaxseed oil. So the best dose was about 3 tablespoons per day. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">I blogged about this</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/07/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-surgery-commuted/">Tyler Cowen</a>, inspired by my results, started taking 2 tablespoons/day. A month later, he no longer needed gum surgery. Knowing nothing about my flaxseed oil intake or Tyler Cowen&#8217;s results, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/03/28/omega-3-and-dental-health/">my dentist told me</a> my gums were in excellent shape, better than ever. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/22/at-thanksgiving-dinner/">My sister&#8217;s gums</a> showed similar improvement. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/06/omega-3-and-dental-health-even-more/">Tucker Max</a> noticed his gums stopped bleeding after he started taking flaxseed oil. He&#8217;d had bleeding gums most of his adult life. Nothing else had helped. He also found <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/">training injuries healed faster</a>. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/16/omega-3-what-happens-when-you-stop/">When he stopped drinking flaxseed oil</a>, his gums soon got worse. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/03/03/root-planing-cancelled/">Carl Willat</a> noticed dramatic gum improvement. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/03/joyce-cohen-gets-her-teeth-cleaned/">Joyce Cohen</a> had excellent results (her gums were &#8220;in great shape &#8212; better than ever&#8221;). <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/10/03/joyce-cohen-gets-her-teeth-cleaned/#comment-48774">Tim Beneke</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/#comment-342479">Jack Rusher</a> had similar results. <a href="http://forum.quantifiedself.com/thread-the-effect-of-diet-on-energy-focus?pid=505#pid505">Gary Wolf</a>, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t like the mental effects. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101026090655.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29">A recent epidemiological study</a> found a weak correlation between inflamed gums and omega-3 intake.</p>
<p>What have I learned? Above all, that such a pattern of results is possible. These results suggest there was/is a big hole in the usual nutritional ideas. Tyler Cowen, me, my sister, etc., were eating a conventionally &#8220;good diet&#8221; yet there was a lot of room for improvement, both in brain function and overall inflammation level. (I&#8217;m sure flaxseed oil heals gums because it reduces inflammation.) And improvement wasn&#8217;t hard &#8212; there was a simple fix. In other words, <strong>omega-3 deficiency is very common</strong>. The conventional deficiency diseases, such as scurvy and pellagra, were/are rare. They appeared only under extreme conditions with very limited diets (e.g., prison, long sea voyage). Yet just as scurvy and pellagra are easily cured, there is a simple cure for omega-3 deficiency: about 2 tablespoons/day of flaxseed oil. (Perhaps ground flaxseed is an even better source.)</p>
<p>Other facts support the idea of widespread omega-3 deficiency. When gums are very red, and bleed very easily, it&#8217;s called gingivitis. According to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3522645">this article</a>, &#8221; estimates of the general prevalence of adult gingivitis vary from approximately 50 to 100%&#8221;. Heart disease is common. There&#8217;s plenty of evidence that <a href="http://thelancet.it/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2810%2970029-3/fulltext">heart disease is caused by inflammation</a> (gated). For example, it&#8217;s well-known that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/17/why-does-gum-disease-correlate-with-heart-disease/">inflamed gums correlate with heart disease</a>. Statins may reduce heart disease &#8212; to the mild extent they do &#8212; <a href="http://www.spacedoc.com/statins_inflammation_heart_disease.html">because they reduce inflammation</a>.</p>
<p>I also learned that psychology can help improve general health (too much inflammation causes all sorts of problems, as Tucker Max&#8217;s experience suggests). My background in experimental psychology made it easy for me to measure balance.  I also found other mental tests were sensitive to flaxseed oil. These mental tests were like an animal model in the sense that they made helpful experiments (e.g., different doses) much easier. My friend Kenneth Carpenter, in <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/117/3/599.full.pdf">his book about the discovery of Vitamin C</a> (gated), stressed the importance of an animal model of scurvy. Once the best dose of flaxseed oil (for me) was known, it turned out to be easy to take a dose that produced dramatic improvement (in others).</p>
<p>The idea that psychology and self-experimentation can improve overall health is new. I presented my flaxseed oil results at a meeting of the Psychonomic Society a few years ago. After my talk, one member of the audience, a professor of psychology at Illinois State University, angrily complained that my talk was &#8220;pop culture&#8221; &#8212; not even pop psychology &#8212; and said I shouldn&#8217;t have been allowed to speak. He thought I had made elementary mistakes.</p>

					<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2011-07-12-efficiency-vs.-day.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3350" title="2011-07-12 efficiency vs. day" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2011-07-12-efficiency-vs.-day.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>In March I discovered that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/05/01/percentile-feedback-and-productivity/">looking at a graph of my productivity (for the current day, with a percentile attached) was a big help</a>. My &#8220;efficiency&#8221; &#8212; the time spent working that day divided by the time available to work &#8212; jumped as soon as the new feedback started (as this graph shows). The percentile score, which I can get at any moment during the day, indicates how my current efficiency score ranks according to scores from previous days within one hour of the same time. For example, a score of 50 at 1 p.m. means that half of the previous days&#8217; scores from noon to 2 p.m. were better, half worse. The time available to work starts when I get up. For example, if I got up at 4 a.m., at 6 a.m. there were 2 hours available to work. The measurement period usually stops at dinner time or in the early evening.</p>
<p>This graph shows the results so far. It shows efficiency scores at the end of each day. (Now and then I take a day off.) One interesting fact is I&#8217;ve kept doing it. The data collection isn&#8217;t automated; I shift to R to collect it, typing &#8220;work.start&#8221; or &#8220;work.stop&#8221; or &#8220;work.switch&#8221; when I start, stop, or switch tasks. This is the third or fourth time I&#8217;ve tried some sort of work tracking system and the first time I have persisted this long. Another interesting fact is the slow improvement, shown by the positive slopes of the fitted lines. Apparently I am slowly developing better work habits.</p>
<p>The behavioral engineering is more complicated than you might think. My daily activities naturally divide into three categories: 1. things I want to do but have to push myself to do. This helps with that, obviously. 2. things I don&#8217;t want to do a lot of but have to push myself away from (e.g., web surfing). 3. things I want to do and have no trouble doing. But the recording system is binary. What do I do with activities in the third category? Eventually I decided to put the short-duration examples (e.g., standing on one foot, lasts 10 minutes) in the first category (counts as work), keeping the long-duration examples (e.g., walking, might last one hour) in the second category (doesn&#8217;t count as work).</p>
<p>Before I started this I thought of a dozen reasons why it wouldn&#8217;t work, but it has. In line with my belief that it is <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/10/better-to-do-than-to-think/">better to do than to think</a>.</p>

					<p>The most important thing I learned in graduate school &#8212; or ever &#8212; about research is: <em>Better to do than to think</em>. By <em>do</em> I mean collect data. It is better to do an experiment than to think about doing an experiment, in the sense that you will learn more from an hour spent doing (e.g., doing an experiment) than from an hour thinking about what to do. Because 99% of what goes on in university classrooms and homework assignments is much closer to thinking than doing, and because professors often say they teach &#8220;thinking&#8221; (&#8220;I teach my students how to think&#8221;) but never say they teach &#8220;doing&#8221;, you can see this goes against prevailing norms. I first came across this idea in <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2319737">an article by Paul Halmos</a> about teaching mathematics. Halmos put it like this: &#8220;The best way to learn is to do.&#8221; When I put it into practice, it was soon clear he was right. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/10/better-to-do-than-to-think/#more-3313" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

<p>Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978) (a book called <em>Statistics for Experimenters</em>) is well-regarded by statisticians. Perhaps Box, Hunter, and Hunter, and Andrew, were/are unfamiliar with another quote (modified <a href="http://www.todayinsci.com/B/Beveridge_WIB/BeveridgeWIB-Quotations.htm">from Beveridge</a>): &#8220;Everyone believes an experiment except the experimenter; no one believes a theory except the theorist.&#8221; <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/07/causal-reasoning-in-science/#more-3241" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>I have <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/autism/sonograms-cause-autism/">blogged several times</a> about Caroline Rodger&#8217;s idea that sonograms during pregnancy greatly increase the risk of autism in the fetus. Her idea is supported by several lines of evidence, as she explains in <a href="http://carolinerodgers.wordpress.com/2010/07/20/red-flags-regarding-first-trimester-care-autism/">this talk</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/archgenpsychiatry.2011.76">A new study</a> provides more evidence. It found a high concordance rate among fraternal twins. In the general population from which the new study was drawn (California), about 1 child in 100 has autism. But if you are an identical twin, and your co-twin has autism spectrum disorder, your chance of having the same diagnosis is about 70%. The crucial point of the study is that the concordance was also high for fraternal twins: about 40%.  <a href="http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=011000ME25V5">As one commenter put it</a>, this result &#8220;puts a spotlight on pregnancy as a time when environmental factors might exert their effects&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304450604576419761141034324.html?mod=rss_Health">Another study</a> found more risk of autism if the mom took an anti-depressant during pregnancy. This supports the idea that a bad prenatal environment causes autism.</p>

Watson, co-discovery of the structure of DNA, said</p>
<blockquote><p>Some day a child is going to sue its parents for being born. They will say, My life is so awful with these terrible genetic defects.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Quoted by Richard Bentall in <em>Doctoring the Mind.</em>) Watson is implying that genetic defects matter in the big picture of human impairment. They don&#8217;t. Changes over time in disease incidence, migration studies (in all instances I know of, the disease profile of the migrating group changes to match the place where they live), powerful nutritional effects (e.g., Weston Price) and other evidence of environmental potency show that all major diseases (heart disease, cancer, depression, obesity, plague, tuberculosis, smallpox, etc.) are mostly caused by the environment, in the sense that environmental changes could greatly reduce their incidence. Genes are a distraction. (To say that major diseases are also &#8220;caused&#8221; by genes in the sense that genes affect environmental potency is to miss the point that we want to reduce the diseases &#8212; want to reduce obesity for example &#8212; so it is the environmental lever that matters. If a child could eliminate its obesity by changing its environment, it would not sue its parents.) If Watson was unaware of that, okay. But for him to claim the <strong>opposite </strong>is a great &#8212; and I am afraid profoundly self-serving &#8212; delusion. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/05/great-delusions-james-watson/#more-3224" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>Last night I went to a beer tasting in San Francisco. I didn&#8217;t taste all the beers but of the 15-odd I did taste the best were by <a href="http://www.uncommonbrewers.com/index.php">Uncommon Brewers</a> &#8212; especially their <a href="http://www.uncommonbrewers.com/twin.php">Siamese Twin</a> (&#8220;the floral notes of lemongrass and sharper bite of kaffir lime blend with the deep malt&#8221;) and <a href="http://www.uncommonbrewers.com/baltic.php">Baltic Porter</a> (&#8220;whole licorice root and star anise&#8221;).</p>
<p>Five or six years ago I went to a sake-tasting event in San Francisco called &#8220;The Joy of Sake&#8221;. About 140 sakes. In a few hours I became such a sake connoisseur that the sake I could afford  &#8212; and used to buy regularly &#8212; I now despised. The only sake I now liked was so expensive ($80/bottle) that I never bought another bottle of sake.</p>

				<small>Thursday, June 30th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In December, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported &#8212; very briefly &#8212; that from 2007 to 2008, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/09/news/la-heb-stroke-20101209">life expectancy in the United States declined by 0.1 year</a>. It should have been the lead story of every newspaper in the country with the largest possible headlines (&#8220;<strong>LESS LIFE</strong>&#8220;). Did 9/11 reduce life expectancy this much? Of course not. Did World War II? Not in a visible way &#8212; American life expectancy rose during World War II. I can&#8217;t think any event in the last 100 years that made such a difference to Americans. The decline is even more newsworthy when you realize: 1. It is the continuation of trends. The yearly increase in life expectancy has been dropping for about the last 40 years. 2. Americans spend far more on health care than any other country. Meaning vast resources have been available to translate new discoveries into practice. 3. Americans spend far more on health research than any other country and should be the first to benefit from new discoveries.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m biased (because my research is health-related) but I think this is the biggest event of our time. It is the Industrial Revolution <strong>in reverse</strong> &#8212; progress grinding to a halt. For no obvious reason, just as the Industrial Revolution had no obvious reason. Health researchers have been given billions of dollars to improve our health, the whole system has been given tens of billions of dollars, and the result is &#8230; nothing. Worse than nothing.</p>
<p>No journalist, with the exception of Gary Taubes, seems the least bit aware of this. It is a difficult story to cover, true. But several journalists, such as health writers for <em>The New Yorker</em> (Atul Gawande, Michael Specter, and Jerome Groopman) are perfectly capable of covering it. They haven&#8217;t. With a few exceptions, they write about progress (e.g., Peter Provonost&#8217;s checklists). It is like only reporting instances when Dirk Nowitzki missed a free throw. Each instance is true but the big picture they create &#8212; he misses all free throws &#8212; is profoundly false.</p>
<p>Among academics, the stagnation has received a tiny amount of attention. In <a href="http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/66B/1/75.full">a recent paper</a> (gated), two University of Southern California professors, considering a wider time period, point out that there has been some improvement in how long you live after you get sick, but no improvement in how long you live before getting sick. Here is how the discussion section of their article begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is substantial evidence that we have done little to date [meaning: from the 1960s to the 1990s] to  eliminate or delay disease or the physiological changes  that are linked to age. For example, the incidence  of a first heart attack has remained relatively stable between the 1960s and 1990s and the incidence of some of the most  important cancers has been increasing until very recently. Similarly,  there have been substantial increases in the incidence of  diabetes in the last decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is my explanation of the paradox of: 1. Enormous and increasing health care costs. 2. Vast amounts spent on research. 3. No better health. Health researchers, such as medical school professors, shape their research to favor expensive treatments, such as expensive drugs. In fact, the best treatments would cost nothing (e.g., the Shangri-La Diet). To make the expensive treatments seem worth studying, they invent utterly false theories and claim to believe them. For an example (research about depression), see <em>The Emperor&#8217;s New Drugs</em> by Irving Kirsch. Because health researchers are forced to worship absurd theories, they are incapable of good research. Absence of good research is why there is no progress. The health care supply chain &#8212; everyone between you and the research, such as doctors, nurses, drug company employees, hospital employees, alternative medicine practitioners, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/28/the-medtronics-scandal/">medical device makers</a>, and so on &#8212; is happy with the situation (useless research) because it ensures that little will change and they will continue to get paid. They are the supposed experts &#8212; and remain silent.</p>
<p>It is human nature that everyone in the supply chain remains silent. They are protecting their jobs. But the silence of the journalists is The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes writ large. To explain why smart journalists fail to notice the stagnation, I think you have to go back to studies of conformity. When everyone you talk to &#8212; people in the supply chain  &#8212; says black = white (i.e., that progress is being made), you say the same thing.</p>
<p>Why is personal science, the main subject of this blog, important? Because <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/05/30/why-does-personal-science-matter/">it is a way out of this stagnation</a>.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ac468dee-9c35-11e0-acbc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1Q0qm8oY2">Martin Wolf relays</a> what passes for wisdom:</p>
<blockquote><p>Albert  Einstein is reported to have said that insanity consists of doing the  same thing over and over again and expecting different results.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, if true, shows that Einstein was a theorist.</p>
<p>Call me insane. Based on many years of data collection, I believe <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf">scientific progress has a power-law distribution.</a> You sample from this distribution when you collect data. You collect data again and again &#8212; &#8220;doing the same thing over and over again&#8221;. Almost all the data you collect produces little progress; a tiny fraction produces great progress. The secret to scientific progress is doing the same thing over and over &#8212; and being wise enough to grasp that the results will vary greatly. (Nassim Taleb understands this.) In the short term, it seems like you are getting nowhere.</p>
<p>I learned this lesson from <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">my sleep research</a>. For ten years I tried various solutions to my problem of early awakening. Nothing worked. All my ideas were wrong. Eventually I got &#8220;lucky&#8221; but actually I made my own luck by persisting so long.</p>
<p>Once you realize the distribution of progress, you grasp that the secret of success is making the cost per sample as low as possible. Few scientists, in my experience, have figured this out. They prefer expensive experiments because larger grants signal higher status. <em>Won&#8217;t fancy equipment tell me more? </em>they rationalize. Grant givers, also failing to understand the basic point, are happy to oblige the status-seekers: Much easier to administer one $200,000 grant than 10 $20,000 grants. And progress slows to a crawl.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rita_Mae_Brown">Rita Mae Brown</a> is a more likely source of this saying than Albert Einstein.</p>

					<p>The more certain you are the more power you have to convince others and convince yourself. You may want to convince them that change is needed &#8212; e.g., that a polluting factory should be shut down or cleaned up. China has a huge problem with industrial pollution, as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/99441/section/5">this report</a> describes. Children are especially at risk.</p>
<p>The danger to those in power posed by self-tracking &#8212; in particular, blood tests that measure lead &#8212; is shown by this quote from the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even parents who were able to access [lead] testing for their children reported difficulties in obtaining the results of the tests conducted. Many parents in Yunnan and Shaanxi reported that test results from their children’s lead tests were withheld completely. Some parents in Yunnan and Shaanxi told Human Rights Watch that they never saw any test results. Others were allowed to see the results from initial testing but were prevented from seeing the results from follow-up testing.</p></blockquote>
<p>My daily arithmetic tests (how fast can I do simple arithmetic, such as 3 + 5) have the same purpose as the lead tests: to assess the quality of the environment. If my scores get worse, it may reflect poisoning. Comparison with a blood test for lead highlights strengths and weaknesses of my arithmetic test.</p>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Sensitive to many things</strong>. Can detect any bad influence on the brain, not just lead.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Free</strong> in the sense that the cost is zero (so long as you have a laptop).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Unrestrictable</strong>. No one can deny you access.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Fast</strong>. You get the results immediately.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Great sensitivity</strong>. You can test yourself as often as you want. The more tests you do the more easily you can detect a change.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Variability known</strong>. By looking at a graph of your data (score vs. day) you can judge the natural variability &#8212; essential for judging the importance of a deviation. With lab tests, the variability is rarely known to the person whose blood was tested or the doctor that reviews the results.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Measures what you care about</strong>. You care about health. Brain health is part of that. Sure, high levels of lead are bad, but what about low levels? Is there a hormetic effect? The dose-response function isn&#8217;t obvious.</p>
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Unconventional</strong>. A lead test is easier to understand.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Unspecific</strong>. If a score is bad (= if I get slower) it isn&#8217;t clear why. If you have too much lead in your blood the cause is likely to be obvious (e.g., polluting factory, lead in food).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Sophistication needed</strong>. The arithmetic test is sensitive to hundreds of environmental factors, I&#8217;m sure, so identifying the cause of any change inevitably requires sophistication. For example, perhaps you need to control the time of day. Another example is that you need to control/allow/adjust for practice effects.</p>
<p>If the Chinese parents were able to measure their children&#8217;s brain functions themselves, they might be far more outraged &#8212; and therefore far more powerful.</p>
