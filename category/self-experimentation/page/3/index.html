				<small>Friday, January 13th, 2012</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Peter A. Lawrence is a British biologist who has written <a href="http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/PAL/NewFiles/PAListFrames.html">several papers</a> about problems with the way biology and other areas of science are now done. In<a href="http://www.lab-times.org/labtimes/issues/lt2011/lt02/lt_2011_02_24_31.pdf"> this interview</a> a year ago he summarizes his complaints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientific publication &#8220;has become a system of collecting counters for particular purposes – to get grants, to get tenure, etc. – rather than to communicate and illuminate findings to other people. The literature is, by and large, unreadable.&#8221; There is far too much counting of papers.</li>
<li>&#8220;There’s a reward system for building up a large group, if you can, and it doesn’t really matter how many of your group fail, as long as one or two succeed. You can build your career on their success.&#8221; If you do something on your own it is viewed with suspicion.</li>
<li>There is too much emphasis on counting citations. &#8220;If you work in a big crowded field, you’ll get many more citations. . . . This is independent of the quality of the work or whether you’ve contributed anything. [There is] enormous pressure on the journals to accept papers that will be cited a lot. And this is also having a corrupting effect. Journals will tend to take papers in medically-related disciplines, for example, that mention or relate to common genetic diseases. Journals from, say, the Cell group, will favor such papers when they’re submitted.&#8221;</li>
<li>Grant writing takes too much time &#8212; e.g., 30-40% of your time. &#8220;There is an enormous increase in bureaucracy – form<br />
filling, targeting, assessment, evaluations. This has gone right through society, like the Black Death!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Science is not like some kind of an army, with a large number of people who make the main steps forward together. You need to have individually creative people who are making breakthroughs – who make things different. But how do you find those people? I don’t think you want to have a situation in which only those who are competitive and tough can<br />
get to the top, and those who are reflective and retiring would be cast aside.&#8221; I&#8217;ve said something similar: Science is like single ants wandering around looking for food, not like a trail of ants to and from a food source. The trail of ants is engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree. I would add that I think modern biology is far too invested in the idea that genes cause disease and that studying genes will help reduce human suffering. I think the historical record (the last 30 years) shows that this is not a promising line of work &#8212; but modern biologists cannot switch course.</p>
<p>What explains the depressing facts Lawrence points out? I think it is something deep and impossible to change: <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2010%20The%20unreasonable%20effectiveness%20of%20my%20self-experimentation.pdf"><strong>Science and job don&#8217;t mix well</strong></a>. The demands of any job and the demands of science are not very compatible. Jobs are about repetition. Science is the opposite. Jobs demand regular output. Science is unpredictable. However, jobs and science  overlap in terms of training: Both benefit from specialized knowledge. They also overlap in terms of resources: More resources (e.g., better tools) will usually help you do your job better, likewise with science. So we have two groups (insiders &#8212; professional scientists &#8212; and outsiders &#8212; everyone else). Both groups have big advantages and big disadvantages relative to the other. In the last 50 years, the insiders have been &#8220;winning&#8221; in the sense of doing better work. Their advantages of training and resources far outweighed the problems caused by the need for repetition and predictability. But now &#8212; as I try to show on this blog &#8212; outsiders are catching up and going ahead because the necessary training and tools have become much more widely available (e.g., tools have become much cheaper). And, as Lawrence emphasizes, professional science has gotten worse.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>An earlier post asked for Tokyo recommendations. A kind reader (Andrew Clarke) provided the following recommendations of off-beat restaurants:</p>
<blockquote><p>One place I always recommend is Andy&#8217;s Shinhinomoto, in Yurakucho: <a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/tokyo/D61101.html" target="_blank">http://www.frommers.com/<wbr>destinations/tokyo/D61101.html</wbr></a>. I have never seen a travel show that has covered the place, but it&#8217;s a best kept secret within the ex-pat community. Its menu is a standard Japanese Izakaya (pub) menu with some of the freshest sashimi (and fish in general) in Tokyo, and the strangest thing &#8211; it&#8217;s ran by a long-term British ex-pat, who is so renowned for his ability to pick good ingredients that he selects and delivers fish for several local sushi shops. Upstairs seating is best for atmosphere, but the food is the same downstairs. They have an English menu, and I&#8217;d also recommend the fish head and tempura. It&#8217;s also not super expensive, somehow I never manage to spend more than 7000Y  with alcohol. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/01/07/tokyo-restaurant-recommendations-and-why-they-might-be-a-bad-idea/#more-5341" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p></blockquote>

				<small>Saturday, December 31st, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A blog called <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/">Adventures in Nutritional Therapy</a> (started March 2011) is about what the author learned while trying to solve her health problems via nutrition and a few other things. She usually assumed her health problems were due to too much or too little of some nutrient. She puts it like this: &#8220;using mostly non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) supplements and treatments to address depression, brain fog, insomnia, migraines, hypothyroidism, restless legs, carpal tunnel syndrome, and a bunch of other annoyances.&#8221; In contrast to what &#8220;the American medical establishment&#8221; advises. Mostly it is nutritional self-experimentation about a wide range of health problems.</p>
<p>Interesting things I learned from the archives:</p>
<p>1. Question: Did Lance Armstrong take performance-enhancing drugs? I learned that LiveStrong (Armstrong&#8217;s site) is a content farm. Now answer that question again.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;If you return repeatedly to a conventional doctor with a problem they can’t solve, they will eventually suggest you need antidepressants.&#8221;</p>
<p>3.  &#8220;When I mentioned [to Dr. CFS] the mild success I’d had with zinc, he said it was in my mind: I wanted it to work and it did. When I pointed out that 70% of the things I tried didn’t work, he changed the subject. Dr. CFS’ lack of basic reasoning skills did nothing to rebuild my confidence in the health care system.&#8221; Quite right. I have had the same experience. Most things I tried failed. When something finally worked, it could hardly be a placebo effect. This line of reasoning has been difficult for some supposedly smart people to grasp.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/04/the-story-of-the-end-of-my-depression/">A list of things that helped her with depression</a>. &#8220;Quit gluten&#8221; is number one.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">Pepsi caused her to get acne</a>. Same here.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/05/how-i-induced-cystic-acne-in-myself/">100 mg/day of iron caused terrible acne</a> that persisted for weeks after she stopped taking the iron.</p>
<p>7. &#8220;<a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/08/abdominal-pain/">In September 2008</a> I started a journey that serves as a good example of the limits of the American health care system, where you can go through three months, 15 doctor visits, $7,000 in medical tests, three prescriptions and five over-the-counter medications trying to treat your abdominal pain, and after you lose ten pounds due to said pain, you are asked by the “specialists” if you have an eating disorder.&#8221; I agree. Also an example of the inability of people within the American health care system to see those limits.  If they recognized that people outside their belief system might have something valuable to contribute, apparently something awful would happen.</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/07/six-weeks-of-sciatica/">Acupuncture relieved her sciatica</a>, but not for long. &#8220;By the time I left [the acupuncturist's office] the pain was gone, but it crept back during my 30-minute drive home.&#8221;</p>
<p>9. Pointing out many wrongs does not equal a right. She praises <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/09/sugar-bitter-pill-video/">a talk by Robert Lustig</a> about evil fructose. I am quite sure that fructose (by itself) did not cause the obesity epidemic. For one thing, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I lost a lot of weight by drinking it</a>. (<a href="http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf">Here is an advanced discussion</a>.) In other words, being a good critic of other people&#8217;s work (as Lustig may be) doesn&#8217;t get you very far. I think it is hard for non-scientists (and even some scientists) to understand that all scientific work has dozens of &#8220;flaws&#8221;. Pointing out the flaws in this or that is little help, unless those flaws haven&#8217;t been noticed. What usually helps isn&#8217;t seeing flaws, it is seeing what can be learned.</p>
<p>10. <a href="http://www.adnuther.com/2011/06/headaches-and-migraines/">A list of what caused headaches and migraines</a>. One was MSG. Another was Vitamin D3, because it made her Vitamin B1 level too low.</p>
<p>She is a good writer. Mostly I found support for my beliefs: 1. Of the two aspects of self-experimentation (measure, change),  change is more powerful. She does little or no self-tracking  (= keeping records) as far as I could tell, yet has made a lot of progress. She has done a huge amount of trying different things. 2. Nutritional deficiencies cause a lot of problems. 3. Fermented food is overlooked. She never tries it, in spite of major digestive problems. She does try probiotics. 4. American health care is exceedingly messed-up. As she puts it, &#8220;the American medical establishment has no interest in this approach [which often helped her] and, when they do deign to discuss it, don&#8217;t know what the #%@! they&#8217;re talking about.&#8221; 5. &#8220;Over the years I&#8217;ve found accounts of personal experiences to be very helpful.&#8221; I agree. Her blog and mine are full of them.</p>

					<p>In November, at Quantified Self Europe, Martha Rotter, who lives in Ireland, gave a talk about how she cured her acne by self-experimentation. She <a href="http://martharotter.com/blog/index.php/2011/11/quantified-self-europe-review/">summarizes her talk</a> like this (slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/martharotter/curing-your-skin-with-food">here</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>When I moved to Ire­land [from Seattle] in 2007, I began to have skin prob­lems. It began gradu­ally and I attrib­uted it to the move, to stress, to late nights drink­ing with developers and cli­ents, to travel, to whatever excuses I could think of. The stress was mul­ti­plied by the anxi­ety of being embar­rassed about how my face looked, but also because my new job in Ire­land involved me being on stage in front of large audi­ences con­stantly, often sev­eral times a week. A year later my skin was per­petu­ally inflamed, red, full of sores and very pain­ful. When one spot would go away, two more would spring up in its place. It was a tough time. I cried a lot.</p>
<p>Frus­trated, I went to see my homet­own der­ma­to­lo­gist while I was home for hol­i­days. He told me that a) this was com­pletely nor­mal and b) there was noth­ing I could do but go on anti­bi­ot­ics for a year (in addi­tion to spend­ing a for­tune on creams and pills). I didn’t believe either of those things.</p>
<p>I was not inter­ested in being on an anti­bi­otic for a year, nor was I inter­ested in Accu­tane (my best friend has had it mul­tiple times and it hasn’t had long term res­ults, plus it can be risky). What I was inter­ested in was fig­ur­ing out why this was hap­pen­ing and chan­ging my life to make it stop. I refused to accept my dermatologist’s insist­ence that what you put in your body has no effect on how you look and feel.</p>
<p>I began sys­tem­at­ic­ally cut­ting things out of my diet to see how I reacted. First chicken and soy, based on a recom­mend­a­tion from a food aller­gist. Over the course of a year I cut out sugar, glu­ten, carbs, starches, caf­feine, meat, fish until finally the magical month of Decem­ber 2010 when I cut out dairy. My skin was my own again by New Year’s day this year.</p>
<p>It took a year to fig­ure it out. It was com­pletely worth it. There’s noth­ing wrong with Irish dairy, it just doesn’t work for me. I drink Amer­icanos instead of lattes now, I don’t eat cer­eal; none of that is a huge deal. For what it’s worth, I can drink goat’s milk.</p></blockquote>
<p>A great example of the power of self-experimentation compared to trusting doctors. One quibble: I&#8217;ll be more sure &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing wrong with Irish dairy&#8221; if she finds that American dairy also causes skin problems. The evidence so far (she didn&#8217;t have skin problems until she moved to Ireland) suggests that at least for her American dairy (i.e., dairy where she lived in America) is better than Irish dairy. I have heard Irish dairy praised. They sell Irish butter at Beijing stores near me. I won&#8217;t be buying it.</p>
<p>At the end of her post she makes a very important point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Quan­ti­fied Self isn’t for every­one, but <em>every­one</em> should feel they have the power to change things in their body and their life for the better.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. By learning about examples of people who have done just that &#8212; such as Martha &#8212; we will come closer to having that power. Right now, as far as I can tell, most people feel helpless. They do what doctors or other experts tell them to do, even if it doesn&#8217;t work very well.</p>
<p>Long ago, hardly anyone could read. This left them in the grip of those who could. But eventually came mass literacy, when the benefits of reading finally exceeded the costs (e.g., because more books were available at lower prices). Reading is primitive science: if you read about things that happened, it is information gathering. It resembles doing a survey. Nowadays, almost everyone (in rich countries) reads, but almost no one does experimental science. This leaves them in the grip of those who can do experimental science (e.g., drug companies). I think my work and Martha&#8217;s work suggest we are close to another turning point, where, for nonscientists, the benefits of doing experiments exceed the costs.</p>

					<p>At the SLD forums, <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8193.msg104982#msg104982">Anima describes</a> using several  safe cheap treatments to improve his mood and sleep. First, he tried wearing blue blocker (amber) glasses in the evening. They made him fall asleep more easily and reduced or eliminated hypomania. However, he was still depressed. Second, he tried getting twenty minutes of sunlight early in the morning. His mood improved. But he still had trouble synchronizing his sleep/wake cycle with the sun &#8212; that is, being awake during the day and asleep at night. He would stay up an hour later every night and wake up an hour later every day, meaning that half the time he was asleep during the day and awake at night. Finally, he tried adjusting when he ate:</p>
<blockquote><p>I recently found the missing key to this: meal timing.  I saw a talk that Seth gave where he talked about curing his problem with waking too early by skipping breakfast.  My problem was difficulty waking.  I read an article that suggested that our circadian rhythms are not just tied to light, but to food times as well.  I used to eat late at night and never eat breakfast.  I started eating breakfast immediately upon waking (ick) and stopping all food at least 12 hours before I wanted to wake.  Basically, I did what Seth did only opposite.  It worked. . . . I was even able to adjust my cat&#8217;s circadian rhythm &#8212; he used to wake me up too early for his breakfast &#8212; by gradually moving his supper time.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?topic=8204.msg105131#msg105131">another post</a> he describes using B vitamins to treat his restless legs syndrome and ADHD:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been taking a supplement with all the B vitamins in amounts much higher than typically recommended. I have also been taking Epsom salt baths for magnesium. I have not experienced restless legs AT ALL since starting. This is quite remarkable to me, because it was such a problem. My ADHD is also much improved.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of treating restless legs syndrome with niacin (a B vitamin) came from <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/05/17/restless-legs-syndrome-niacin-and-web-search/">Dennis Mangan</a>. Anima had noticed that ADHD and restless legs syndrome often occur together.</p>
<p>He makes some reasonable comments about psychiatrists:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why are psychiatrists still acting like neurological problems exist in isolation, when clearly they are all related? [In the sense that you can use what is known about how to cure Problem X to help you cure Problem Y, if X and Y often occur together.] I used to take Lamictal, Depakote, Adderall and Ambien every day. That doesn&#8217;t include all the meds I tried that didn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;m currently wearing amber glasses at night and taking a B complex, flax oil (SLD-style) and bathing in epsom salts three times a week. My mood is more stable than it was on medication, and my ADHD is controlled about the same. My sleep is much better. My psychiatrist told me that I would be on medication for the rest of my life. When I told him that I was using dark therapy and light therapy and had stopped taking my medication, he told me that I was &#8220;playing with fire,&#8221; and that I would end up in a mental institution or commit suicide if I didn&#8217;t resume my medication, despite the fact that I had stopped taking it for longer than it would be effective. I asked him if he had read the research on dark therapy. He hadn&#8217;t, but he assured me that it is pseudoscience. I guess the definition of &#8220;pseudoscience&#8221; is any treatment that doesn&#8217;t make him money. I puckishly asked him if I seemed manic or depressed, and he was forced to admit that I did not.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ability of this psychiatrist to ignore contradictory evidence in front of him resembles <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/10/seth-roberts-grandmother-knows-best-about-crohns-disease.html">what happened to Reid Kimball</a>. He told a UCSF gastroenterologist that he was successfully managing his Crohn&#8217;s with diet. <em>In my experience, Crohn&#8217;s can&#8217;t be managed with diet</em>, the doctor said at the end of the appointment.</p>

					<p>At the Quantified Self blog, in response to <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/10/seth-roberts-on-qs-paleo">a video of me talking about QS and the Ancestral Health Symposium</a> (paleo), someone named Colin made <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/10/seth-roberts-on-qs-paleo/#comment-3984">the following comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Very interesting talk. I am just curious how someone can claim a study conducted with a sample size of one is “100 times better” than someone else’s study. I do not know anything about the other study mentioned, but I do know that a study based on n=1 cannot be considered scientific proof. And sure, he hears from people who have lost weight drinking the sugar water he prescribed, but it is quite possible there are 100 times as many people who didn’t email him because they didn’t see any positive results and decided to try something else. I think the QS stuff is very interesting and helpful on a personal level, but it seems like a stretch to generalize your results to others.</p></blockquote>
<p>I responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have two responses.</p>
<p>1. Sample size isn’t everything. Sure, a study with n=1 isn’t “scientific proof”. Nor is any other study, in my experience. “Scientific proof” has always required many studies. New scientific ideas have very often started with n = 1 experiments or observations. Later, larger experiments or observations were done. Both — the initial n=1 observation and the later n = many observations — were necessary for the new idea to be discovered and confirmed.</p>
<p>2. The history of biology teaches there are few exceptions to general rules. See any biology textbook. For example, a textbook might say “lymphocytes fight germs”. This means no serious exceptions have ever been found to that rule. So, as matter of biological history, the person who managed to figure out what one particular lymphocyte does turned out to have figured out what they all do. Biology textbooks have thousands of statements like “lymphocytes fight infection” meaning that this sequence of events (you can generalize from one to all, or nearly all) has happened thousands of times. There is no shadow hidden history of biology that teaches otherwise.</p></blockquote>

				<small>Tuesday, December 13th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>A month ago <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/02/it-matters-when-you-take-vitamin-d-a-stunning-discovery/">I blogged about a &#8220;stunning discovery&#8221;</a>: Primal Girl&#8217;s <a href="http://www.primalgirl.com/2011/11/01/nprimalgirl-sleep-issues-vitamin-d/">sleep got much better</a> when she took Vitamin D3 in the early morning instead of much later (afternoon or evening). <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/03/vitamin-d-sunlight-and-sleep-more/">Others pointed out</a> a similar observation: Taking Vitamin D3 in the evening caused insomnia. These observations suggest that Vitamin D3 resembles sunlight in its effect on sleep: morning exposure good, evening exposure bad. Sunlight, of course, is hard to control and sometimes hard to get (which is why Primal Girl tried Vitamin D3). Sunlight is also time-consuming: it takes an hour to get one hour of sunlight. The timing and dosage of Vitamin D3 is much easier to control.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve tried it. This isn&#8217;t the first time. I&#8217;ve taken Vitamin D3 on and off several times through the years. Each time I didn&#8217;t notice any change so I stopped. But then I&#8217;d hear an interesting argument (never anything as clear as what Primal Girl found), and try again. And stop again. This time I took the Vitamin D3 around 8 am. (In previous attempts, I never controlled the timing and never took it early in the orning.)  I started with 2000 IU/day. I did that for nine days. No clear effect. Then I increased the dose to 4000 IU/day. The change was unmistakeable: I started to wake up feeling somewhat more rested and, for the first time,  with a pleasant warm feeling. So far it&#8217;s been eight days. Something is different and better.</p>
<p>I am writing about this now because the results are already interesting. My experience so far &#8220;proves&#8221; nothing, of course. Let me make clear the limitations: 1. You might consider the effect small. I was already sleeping well. I fell asleep quickly, did not wake up during the night, and woke up feeling rested. Now I wake up feeling more rested. 2. Eight days isn&#8217;t much. Maybe the effect will go away. 3. Maybe the effect doesn&#8217;t depend on time of day. I haven&#8217;t yet tried taking Vitamin D3 at other times of day.</p>
<p>Why do I think this is so important?</p>
<p>1. <strong>Sleep is central to health</strong>. You fight off infection while you are asleep. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">When I improved my sleep, I stopped getting noticeable colds</a>. I&#8217;m sure if people slept better, they would get sick less often. Heart attacks are more common in the winter. People sleep worse in winter.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Sleep is a huge problem</strong>. As far as I can tell, most adult Americans complain about their sleep.</p>
<p>3. <strong>No one expected this</strong>. Nutrition researchers, dieticians, and so on obviously didn&#8217;t expect it. Nor did circadian rhythm researchers. They (or we) think that everyone, including plants, has one or more internal circadian clocks that is/are synchronized (= set) by the environment. The general public thinks that sunlight affects the clock. Lots of research supports this, but circadian-rhythm researchers know something the public does not: that those rhythms are also affected by the time of food and social contact. All three (sunlight, food, social contact) are part of the environment. Their power over our sleep makes sense (e.g., we should be awake when food is available.) Vitamin D3 is not part of the environment. Its power doesn&#8217;t make sense. No one in the paleo community expected this. Stone-Agers got a lot of sunshine, yes. They did not take Vitamin D3 pills. Sure, many in the paleo community praise Vitamin D3 but I have never heard anyone say you should take it in the morning.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Vitamin D3 is safe, cheap, and widely available</strong>. It probably has many benefits, not just better sleep.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Taking pills is easy</strong>. There presently are no safe sleeping pills. Nor are there any cheap sleeping pills. Nor will drug companies ever invent them, if the past is any guide.</p>

					<p>To many dieticians and much of the general public, the similarity between butter and eggs is that both are bad for you. Butter: <em>Fattening! Clogs arteries!</em> Eggs: <em>High in cholesterol! </em>To me, it&#8217;s the opposite: both seem to be unusually <strong>good</strong> for us. Butter seems to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/25/butter-and-arithmetic-how-much-butter/">make my brain work better</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/08/04/how-rare-my-heart-scan-improvement/">may have reduced my risk of heart attack</a>. Eggs &#8212; at least, scrambled eggs &#8212; are <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/30/an-unbiassed-view-of-what-we-should-eat/">especially well-liked by Mr. T, a rat</a>. There are many similarities between rats and humans. Humans also like eggs. The foods we like are a guide (imperfect) to what foods are good for us.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another similarity between butter and eggs: Both must be complete &#8212; contain all necessary nutrients &#8212; much more than any other food. Butter is large part of milk. When mammalian offspring are very young, mother&#8217;s milk is their only food. Eggs, of course, must contain everything needed to become a baby chick (as <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/30/an-unbiassed-view-of-what-we-should-eat/#comment-935994">a commenter named Rashad pointed out</a>). No other foods &#8212; not fruits, not vegetables, not whatever other foods <a href="http://www.slashfood.com/2010/01/15/michael-pollan-on-food-rules/">your great grandmother</a> or other <a href="http://ancestryfoundation.org/AHS.html">ancestors</a> ate &#8212; have been under this sort of evolutionary pressure.</p>

					<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/09/new-source-of-omega-3/">Two months ago I wrote</a> that camelina oil might be a good source of omega-3. A few days ago, a reader named Evelyn Majidi <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/09/new-source-of-omega-3/#comment-935886">commented as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on this suggestion, I ordered camelina oil from the good farmers in Saskatchewan and began taking it using the same dose (3T/day) that I had been taking of flaxseed oil for relief of psoriasis and lichen planus. Unfortunately, <strong>the slow but sure improvement I had been experiencing over the past year with flaxseed oil stopped immediately</strong> and after a week my skin and mouth began to deteriorate. After using about 1/4 of a bottle of the new oil <strong>I went back to flaxseed and am delighted to report that I am [again] having good results with it</strong>. Since both of my conditions wax and wane without any reason identified by medical science I cannot state that it was simply the flaxseed oil that has led to this success. Based on my experience, however, I intend to continue taking the oil regularly and I recommend that others with psoriasis or lichen planus try it. For me, <strong>two tablespoons a day were not enough, I needed three tablespoons of the oil to see a change</strong>. I don’t think it advisable to take capsules, you’d need to take too many to equal 3T of oil.[emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001470/">Psoriasis</a> is a skin disease that usually involves &#8220;thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white patches called scales&#8221;. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001870/">Lichen planus</a> is &#8220;an itchy rash on the skin or in the mouth&#8221;. To give some idea of how common they are, psoriasis has 36 million Google hits; lichen planus 1-2 million. (&#8220;Heart disease&#8221; has 64 million.)</p>
<p>Eveyln&#8217;s experience provides four pieces of evidence that suggest flaxseed oil (FSO) improved her psoriasis and lichen planus:</p>
<ol>
<li>When she started taking FSO at 3 T/day, they started improving. They did not improve with 2 T/day.</li>
<li>Over the first year of FSO, she saw steady improvement in both in place of the usual up and down.</li>
<li>When she replaced FSO with another oil, which she hoped would be better, the results were the opposite of what she wanted: The improvement stopped and the two conditions got worse.</li>
<li>When she switched back to FSO, the improvement resumed.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can think of no plausible alternative to the conclusion that FSO helped. There is plenty of other evidence that supports this conclusion: the evidence that omega-3 is anti-inflammatory, FSO is high in omega-3, most of us don&#8217;t get enough omega-3, and so on, including <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/nutrition/omega-3/omega-3-directory/">my own experience</a>. You could write <a href="http://www.acresusa.com/toolbox/reprints/April08_Allport.pdf">a book about the evidence</a> that supports it. (Evelyn tried flaxseed oil because of reports on this blog that it improved/cured bad gums.)</p>
<p>In any case, the conclusion that FSO reduces psoriasis and lichen planus is new, in the sense that FSO (or another source of omega-3) is not a popular treatment for either condition. <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/psoriasis/DS00193/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs">Here are about 16 treatments</a> for psoriasis, including topical corticosteroids. None includes omega-3. Here are <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/psoriasis/DS00193/DSECTION=lifestyle-and-home-remedies">eight &#8220;lifestyle and home remedies&#8221;</a> for psoriasis, including &#8220;take daily baths&#8221; (seriously, Mayo Clinic Staff?). None includes omega-3. After going through about forty-odd treatments, I found <a href="http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/understanding-psoriasis-treatment?page=2">a reference to fish oil:</a> &#8220;Other research has suggested that taking oral fish oil supplements containing 1.8 to 3.6 grams of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) a day may bring improvement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Same thing for lichen planus. FSO is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen_planus#Treatment">a popular treatment</a>.</p>
<p>If you take flaxseed oil or other omega-3 source to treat psoriasis or lichen planus, I hope you will let me know what happens.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/the_magic_of_ed.html">this post</a>, Bryan Caplan says (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/03/24/agrees-with-me-about-college/">again</a>) that college is vastly overrated. Like me, he says that the only thing college professors know how to do is be professors and that is all they can actually teach. Graduate school, where professors teach students who want to be professors, makes sense. Undergraduate school, where almost no students will become professors, does not. Like me, he ridicules the idea that professors teach students &#8220;how to think&#8221;. </p>
<p>He omits half of my criticism. It isn&#8217;t just teaching (&#8220;how to think&#8221; &#8212; please!), it&#8217;s also evaluation. Professors are terrible at evaluation. Their method of judging student work is very simple: <em>How close is it to what I would have done?</em> The better you can imitate the professor, no matter what the class, the higher your grade. This is <em>one size fits all</em> with a vengeance because there is no opting out. Sure, you can choose your major. But every class is taught by a professor. What if your strengths lie elsewhere &#8212; in something that your professors aren&#8217;t good at? Tough luck. Your strengths will never be noticed or encouraged or developed. </p>
<p>At Berkeley (where Bryan went and I taught) and universities generally, the highest praise is <em>brilliant</em>. <em>Professor X is brilliant</em>. Or: <em>Brilliant piece of work</em>. People can do great things in dozens of ways, but somehow student work is almost never judged by how beautiful, courageous, practical, good-tasting, astonishing, vivid, funny, moving, comfortable, and so on it is. Because that&#8217;s not what professors are good at. (Except in the less-academic departments, such as art and engineering.) To fail to grasp that students can excel in dozens of ways is to seriously shortchange them. To value them at much less than they are worth &#8212; and, above all, to fail to help them grow and find their place in the world after college.</p>
<p>At Berkeley, I figured this out in a way that a libertarian should appreciate: <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/whatdostudentswant.pdf">I gave my students much more choice</a>. For a term project, I said they could do almost anything so long as it was off-campus and didn&#8217;t involve library work. What they chose to do revealed a lot. I began to see not just how different they were from me but how different they were from each other. One of my students chose to give a talk to a high-school class. This was astonishing because she has severe stage fright. Every step was hard. But she did it. &#8220;I learned that if I really wanted to, I could conquer my fear,&#8221; she wrote. </p>
<p>One of my Tsinghua students recently asked me: &#8220;Are you a brave man?&#8221; (She wanted to give me a gift of stinky tofu.) I said no. She said she thought I was brave for coming to China. Perhaps. I have never done anything as brave as what my student with stage fright did. I have never done something that terrified me &#8212; much less <strong>chosen</strong> to do such a thing. Her homework hadn&#8217;t been very good. When I read about her term project &#8212; conquering stage fright &#8212; I realized how badly I had misjudged her. How badly I had failed to appreciate her strengths. I saw that it wasn&#8217;t just her and it wasn&#8217;t just me. By imposing just one narrow way to excel, the whole system badly undervalued almost everyone. Almost everyone had strengths the system ignored. And it&#8217;s a system almost everyone must go through to reach a position of power!</p>
<p>This is related to what I call <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/29/duct-tape-the-eurozone-and-neglect-of-innovation/">the hemineglect of economists</a> &#8212; they fail to see that innovation should be half of economics. Diversity of talents and interests is central to innovation because new things are so often mixtures of old things. By rewarding only one kind of talent, colleges suppress diversity of talent and thereby reduce innovation. (It&#8217;s no coincidence that Steve Jobs, whom we associate with innovation, didn&#8217;t finish college. He saw his talents wouldn&#8217;t be valued.) Psychologists are also guilty of this. Many psychologists glorify IQ. Somehow having a high IQ is crucial to success . . . somehow a society that doesn&#8217;t encourage people with high IQs will do badly. And so on. In <em>The Bell Curve</em>, Herrnstein and Murray showed that high IQ scores correlated with other measures of desirable social outcomes (e.g., income &#8212; people with higher IQ scores made more money). Like many successful people, they failed to see the possibility that the whole world had been shaped to reward the things that the people in power (i.e., they themselves) are good at. Not because those talents work (= produce a better economy). But because they are easy to measure (by college grades). The glorification of IQ has had a solipsistic aspect and has ignored what should be obvious, that diversity of talents and skills promotes innovation. Without a diverse talent pool, any society will do a poor job of solving the problems that inevitably arise.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2011/11/23/climategate-2-0-new-e-mails-rock-the-global-warming-debate/2/">The newly-released climate scientist emails</a> (called Climategate 2.0) from University of East Anglia (Phil Jones) and elsewhere (Michael Mann and others) show that <a href="http://climateaudit.org/2011/11/23/private-expressions-of-uncertainty/">top climate scientists agree </a>with me. Like me (see <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/global-warming/">my posts on global warming</a>), they think the evidence that humans have caused dangerous global warming is weaker than claimed. Unfortunately for the rest of us, they kept their doubts to themselves: &#8220;I just refused to give an exclusive interview to SPIEGEL because I will not cause damage for climate science.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a big reason I have found self-experimentation useful. It showed me that experts exaggerate, that they overstate their certainty. At first I was shocked. My first useful self-experimental results were about acne. I found that one of the two drugs my dermatologist had prescribed didn&#8217;t work. He hadn&#8217;t said <em>This might not work</em>. He didn&#8217;t try to find out if it worked. He appeared surprised (and said &#8220;why did you do that?&#8221;) when I told him it didn&#8217;t work. Another useful self-experimental result was <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">breakfast caused me to wake up too early</a>. Breakfast is widely praised by dieticians (&#8220;the most important meal of the day&#8221;). I have never heard a dietician say <em>It could hurt your sleep </em>or even a modest <em>There&#8217;s a lot we don&#8217;t know</em>. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/morning-faces-therapy-resources/">My discoveries about morning faces and mood</a> are utterly different than what psychiatrists and psychotherapists say about depression.</p>
<p>As anyone paying attention has noticed, it isn&#8217;t just climate scientists, doctors, dieticians, psychiatrists, and psychotherapists. <em>How can you tell when an expert is exaggerating? His lips move. </em>There are two types of journalism: 1. Trusts experts. 2. Doesn&#8217;t trust experts. I suggest using colored headlines to make them easy to distinguish: red = trusts experts, green = doesn&#8217;t trust experts.</p>

					<p>I measure my arithmetic speed  (how fast I do simple arithmetic problems, such as 3+ 4) daily. I assume it reflects overall brain function. I assume something that improves brain function will make me faster at arithmetic.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/13/arithmetic-and-butter/">Two years ago</a> I discovered that butter &#8212; more precisely, substitution of butter for pork fat &#8212; made me faster. This raised the question: how much is best? For a long time I ate 60 g of butter (= 4 tablespoons = half a stick) per day. Was that optimal? I couldn&#8217;t easily eat more but I could easily eat less.</p>
<p>To find out, I did an experiment. At first I continued my usual intake (60 g /day). Then I ate 30 g/day for several days. Finally I returned to 60 g/day. Here are the main results:</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-21-30-g-vs-60-g-butter-per-day-speed.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4731" title="2011-11-21 30 g vs 60 g butter per day speed" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-21-30-g-vs-60-g-butter-per-day-speed-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a>The graph shows that when I switched to 30 g/day, I became slower. When I resumed 60 g/day, I became faster. Comparing the 30 g/day results with the combination of earlier and later 60 g/day results, <em>t</em> = 6, <em>p</em> = 0.000001.<br />

				<div class="entry">
					<p>My alternative to <em>Testing Treatments</em> (199 pages), <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/06/testing-treatments-eight-questions-for-the-authors/">I said recently</a>, is three words: <strong>Ask for evidence</strong>. Ask your doctor for evidence that their recommendation (drugs, surgery, etc.) is better than other possibilities. A few years ago, I asked Dr. Eileen Consorti, a Berkeley surgeon, for evidence that the surgery she recommended (for a hernia I couldn&#8217;t detect) was a good idea.<em> Surgery is dangerous</em>, I said.<em> What about doing nothing?</em></p>
<p>To reread what I&#8217;d written about this  (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/08/29/suppose-you-write-the-times-to-fix-an-error-part-2/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/02/02/a-call-from-dr-eileen-consortis-office/">here</a>), I googled her. I learned she has <a href="http://eileenconsorti.wordpress.com/">a blog</a>. It contains only one post (June 21, 2011). That post is only seven words long. I also learned she has two very similar websites (<a href="http://dreileenconsorti.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://eileenconsortimd.com/">here</a>). Both use her full name and title where most people would use <em>she</em>. Perhaps I caused the blog and websites.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
<p>1. In 2008, during a routine physical, my primary-care doctor finds that I have a hernia, so small I hadn&#8217;t noticed it. He says I should see Dr. Consorti. <em>Do I need surgery for something so small? </em>I ask. <em>Ask her</em>, he says.</p>
<p>2. Dr. Consorti examines my hernia. She recommends surgery (that she would perform). <em>Why?</em> I ask. <em>It could get worse</em>, she says.</p>
<p>3. Eventually I realize that&#8217;s a poor reason. Anything can get worse. Influenced by <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/03/21/robin-hanson-on-doctors/">Robin Hanson,</a> I speak to Dr. Consorti: <em>Surgery is dangerous. What about doing nothing? Is there evidence that the surgery you recommend is beneficial? </em>Dr. Consorti says, yes, there is evidence supporting her recommendation. She says I can find it (studies that compared surgery and no surgery) via Google.</p>
<p>4. I try to find the evidence. I use Google and PubMed. I can&#8217;t find it. My mom, who used to be a medical librarian at UC San Francisco, is an expert at this. She has done thousands of medical searches. She too cannot find any studies supporting Dr. Consorti&#8217;s recommendation. Moreover, she finds an in-progress study that compares surgery for my problem with doing nothing. Apparently some researchers think doing nothing may be better than surgery.</p>
<p>5. I tell Dr. Consorti that my mom and I couldn&#8217;t find the studies she said exist. Dr. Consorti says she will find them. She will let me know when she&#8217;s found them and make copies. I can pick them up at her office.</p>
<p>6. Months pass. I call her office twice. No response.</p>
<p>7. In August 2008, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/08/29/suppose-you-write-the-times-to-fix-an-error-part-2/">I blog about Dr. Consorti&#8217;s continuing failure</a> to produce the studies she seemed  sure existed.</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/08/29/suppose-you-write-the-times-to-fix-an-error-part-2/#comment-214362">A reader named kirk</a> points out &#8220;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16418463?dopt=Abstract">what looks like a relevant hernia study</a>&#8220;.  It concludes: &#8220;Watchful waiting is an acceptable option for men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Delaying surgical repair until symptoms increase is safe.&#8221; This argues against Dr. Consorti&#8217;s recommendation. No one points out studies supporting her recommendation.</p>
<p>9. Two weeks after my post, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/08/29/suppose-you-write-the-times-to-fix-an-error-part-2/#comment-219500">someone who appears to be Dr. Consorti replies</a>. She&#8217;s busy. She has 30 new patients with cancer. She terms my question &#8220;scientific curiosity&#8221;. She says &#8220;I will call you once I clear my desk and do my own literature search.&#8221;</p>
<p>10. More than a year passes. In 2010, I receive a call from Dr. Consorti&#8217;s office. An assistant asks me to remove <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/08/29/suppose-you-write-the-times-to-fix-an-error-part-2/">my blog post</a> about her failure to provide the studies. <em>Why?</em> I ask. <em>It makes her look bad</em>, he says. He says nothing about inaccuracy. I say I would be happy to amend what I wrote to include whatever Dr. Consorti wants to say about it.  The assistant asks if I have any &#8220;further questions&#8221; for her. No, I say. The conversation ends.</p>
<p>11. A little later, I realize I do have a question. In 2008, during the conversation when I asked Dr. Consorti for evidence, I had said surgery is dangerous. In response, she had said no one had died during any of her surgeries. By 2010, I realized that such an answer was seriously incomplete. Many bad things can happen during surgery. Death is only one bad outcome. How likely were other bad outcomes? Dr. Consorti hadn&#8217;t said. She knew about these other bad effects much better than I did, yet, in a discussion of the safety of surgery, she hadn&#8217;t mentioned them. By not mentioning them, she made surgery sound safer than it actually is. <em>Why had she not mentioned them?</em> That&#8217;s my question. I call Dr. Consorti&#8217;s office and reach the person who had called me. I ask my question. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/02/02/a-call-from-dr-eileen-consortis-office/">As I wrote </a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>He tried to answer it. I said I wanted to know Dr. Consorti’s answer. Wait a moment, he said. He came back to the phone. He had spoken to “the doctor”, he said. She wasn’t interested in “further dialogue”. She would contact a lawyer, he told me.</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t heard from her since then.</p>
<p>This story illustrates a big change. As recently as twenty years ago, the doctor-patient balance of power was heavily weighted toward the doctor, in the sense that the doctor exerted considerable influence on the patient (e.g., to have surgery). One reason, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/11/fear-makes-trust-blindness.html">Robin Hanson has emphasized</a>, is human nature: The more fearful we are, the more we trust. Patients are often fearful. Another reason for the power imbalance was information imbalance. The doctor knew a lot about the problem (had encountered many examples, had read a lot about it). The patient, on the other hand, knew almost nothing and could not easily learn more. <em></em><em></em></p>
<p>During the last twenty years, of course, this has changed dramatically. Patients can easily learn a great deal about any health problem. Google, PubMed, on-line forums, <a href="http://www.medhelp.org/">MedHelp</a>, <a href="curetogether.com/">CureTogether</a>, and so on. The story of Dr. Consorti and me illustrates what a difference the new access to information can make.</p>
<p>Personal science (science done to help yourself) has two sides. One is: <strong>collect data</strong>. My self-experimentation is an example. To improve my health, I gathered data about myself.  It worked. My skin improved, <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">I lost weight, slept better, improved my mood</a>, and so on. The other side is: <strong>use data already collected</strong>. That&#8217;s what I did here. My search for data (including my mom&#8217;s search) showed that data already in existence (including the absence of evidence supporting surgery) contradicted Dr. Consorti&#8217;s recommendation. My search was not biassed against her recommendation. I didn&#8217;t care whether she was right or wrong. I just wanted what was best for me.  <a href="http://www.fotuva.org/feynman/what_is_science.html">As Feynman said</a>, science is the opposite of trusting experts &#8212; including doctors. My first glimpse of the power of self-experimentation was when it showed me that one of the two medicines my dermatologist had prescribed didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Overtreatment is an enormous problem in America. <a href="http://overtreated.com/the_book.html"><em>Overtreated</em></a><em> </em>by Shannon Brownlee and <a href="http://www.beacon.org/productdetails.cfm?PC=2174"><em>Overdiagnosed</em></a> by  H. Gilbert Welch, Lisa Schwartzl and Steve Woloshin are recent books about it. Overtreatment could easily be why <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/spending-more-doesnt-make-us-healthier/">Americans pay far more for health care than people in any other country</a>  yet die earlier than people in many countries. A large fraction of our health care may do more harm than good. A common view is that the incentives are wrong. As <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/06/testing-treatments-eight-questions-for-the-authors/#comment-931027">one commenter</a> put it, <em>pay for treatment, you get treatment</em>. The solution, according to this view, is to change the incentives. That&#8217;s a good idea but will not happen soon. I believe overtreatment can be reduced now. You can (a) <strong>ask for evidence</strong> (as I did) and (b) <strong>search for evidence</strong> (as I did). The difference in lifespan between America and other countries suggests this might add years to your life.</p>
<p>I would like to find out what happens when people ask for evidence and/or search for evidence. Please send me your stories or post them in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>More</strong> Two days after I posted this, Dr. Consorti replied to this post and the earlier one with essentially the same comment, which is <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/02/02/a-call-from-dr-eileen-consortis-office/">here</a>.</p>

					<p>In a <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/06/testing-treatments-eight-questions-for-the-authors/">previous post</a> I criticized the book <em>Testing Treatments</em>. Two of the authors, Paul Glasziou and Iain Chalmers, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/06/testing-treatments-eight-questions-for-the-authors/#comment-931970">have responded</a>. I have <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/06/testing-treatments-eight-questions-for-the-authors/#comment-931978">replied to their response</a>. They did not respond to the main point of my post, which is that the preferences and values of their book &#8212; called <em>evidence-based medicine</em> &#8212; hinder innovation.</p>
<p>Sure, care about evidence. Of course. But don&#8217;t be an <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/06/08/evidence-snobs/">evidence snob</a>.</p>
