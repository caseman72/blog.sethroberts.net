					<p>A month ago I bought three identical tea pots <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/">to compare tea</a> side by side. I hoped to take advantage of<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/08/the-willat-effect-side-by-side-comparisons-create-connoisseurs/"> the Willat Effect</a> (side-by-side comparisons create connoisseurs) to become a tea connoisseur.</p>
<p>It worked. Side-by-side tea comparisons are fun, easy, and have taught me a lot. When I drink tea I notice more and like it more. I do about three comparisons per day. I blogged about the first results <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/24/even-more-about-the-willat-effect/">here</a>. The most useful idea about these comparisons came from Carl Willat himself: Compare the same tea brewed differently (e.g., different amounts of tea, different brewing times, different water temperatures). Most of my comparisons vary amount of tea or brewing time.</p>
<p>These many  comparisons have had several effects: <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/09/the-willat-effect-more-consequences/#more-4480" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

				<small>Sunday, November 6th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>From <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/03/vitamin-d-sunlight-and-sleep-more/#comment-930611">this comment</a> (thanks, <a href="http://www.elizabethmolin.com/">Elizabeth Molin</a>) I learned of a British book called <em>Testing Treatments</em> (<a href="http://www.testingtreatments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TT-interactive-optimised.pdf">pdf</a>), whose second edition has just come out. Its goal is to make readers more sophisticated consumers of medical research. To help them distinguish &#8220;good&#8221; science from &#8220;bad&#8221; science. Ben Goldacre, the Bad Science columnist, <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2011/10/new-edition-of-testing-treatments-best-lay-text-on-evidence-based-medicine/">fulsomely praises it</a> (&#8220;I genuinely, truly, cannot recommend this awesome book highly enough for its clarity, depth, and humanity&#8221;). He wrote a foreword. The main text is by Imogen Evans (medical journalist), Hazel Thornton (writer),  Iain Chalmers (medical researcher), and Paul Glaziou (medical researcher, editor of <em>Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine</em>).</p>
<p>To me, as I&#8217;ve said, medical research is almost entirely bad. Almost all medical researchers accept two remarkable rules: (a) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/09/18/first-let-them-get-sick/"><strong>first, let them get sick</strong></a> and (b) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/29/no-cheap-remedies/"><strong>no cheap remedies</strong></a>. These rules severely limit what is studied. In terms of useful progress, the price of these limits has been enormous: near total enfeeblement. For many years the Nobel Prize in Medicine has documented the continuing failure of medical researchers all over the world to make significant progress on all major health problems, including depression, heart disease, obesity, cancer, diabetes, stroke, and so on. It is consistent with their level of understanding that some people associated with medicine would write a book about how to do something (good science) the whole field manifestly can&#8217;t do. <em>Testing Treatments</em> isn&#8217;t just a fat person writing a book about how to lose weight, it&#8217;s the author failing to notice he&#8217;s fat. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/06/testing-treatments-eight-questions-for-the-authors/#more-4458" class="more-link">(more&hellip;)</a></p>

					<p>In response to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/24/flaxseed-oil-cures-bleeding-gums-in-three-days/">this post</a>, which went up three months ago, <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/24/flaxseed-oil-cures-bleeding-gums-in-three-days/#comment-930329">a reader named Tara has just written</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I started taking 2 TB of flax oil daily about four days ago and now my gums are barely bleeding at all after I brush and floss</strong>. My gums were red, swollen and would bleed after I brushed and flossed and are now pink and healthy looking.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve had this problem for years</strong> and I could not understand why it would keep happening even though I was consistent with my dental routine. I take the berry flavored Barlean’s flax oil mainly because it tastes good and so I look forward to taking it- if it was gross I would not be consistent with taking it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks for the information! I wish dentists would look into this but they probably won’t so I’m glad that you do.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree about the Barlean&#8217;s, by the way. Their <a href="www.barleans.com/omega_swirl.asp">Omega Swirl flaxseed oil</a> does taste good. The Omega Swirl webpage does not list healthy gums as one of its benefits. Instead it lists a bunch of benefits, such as &#8220;Heart Health&#8221; that are nearly impossible to verify.</p>
<p>Someone recently told me something fascinating about flaxseed oil: <strong>It made it much easier to kneel on the floor</strong>.  Before he started taking it, his knees would hurt after a few seconds. Now they don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t remember my knees hurting quickly but I consume 66 g/day of ground flaxseed (= about 2 T flaxseed oil) and can kneel without pain for minutes.</p>
<p>The tiny fact reflected in Tara&#8217;s comment &#8212; an easily-available supplement (flaxseed oil) quickly cures a common problem (bleeding gums) but hardly anyone knows this &#8212; is  a devastating comment on our health care system.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Dentists haven&#8217;t managed to figure this out</strong>. Flaxseed oil is not an obscure supplement. Dentists are not making money giving people much worse advice (&#8220;floss regularly&#8221;).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Nutrition professors haven&#8217;t managed to figure this out</strong>. Omega-3 is not an obscure nutrient. Nevertheless, the <a href="http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2010.asp">2010 USDA Dietary Guidelines </a>says omega-3 fats are &#8220;essential&#8221; but says nothing about how much you need. Inflammation is believed to be the cause of many diseases, including heart disease. By getting this one thing  (minimum omega-3 intake you need to be healthy) right, the USDA could do a world of good. Instead they tell people to eat less animal fat (&#8220;consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fatty acids&#8221;).</p>
<p>To be fair, professional researchers are starting to figure this out.  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/healthday/644899.html">A 2010 study</a> of 9000 people found that &#8220;participants in the middle and upper third for omega-3 fatty acid consumption were between 23 percent and 30 percent less likely to have gum disease than those who consumed the least amount of omega-3 fatty acids.&#8221; With the right dose, I believe gum disease becomes 100% less likely. But at least they noticed a connection.</p>

				<small>Thursday, November 3rd, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In the comments on <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/02/it-matters-when-you-take-vitamin-d-a-stunning-discovery/">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>  (&#8220;Can Vitamin D Replace Sunlight? A Stunning Discovery&#8221;), two commenters (John and Aaron Blaisdell) noted that Nephropal had said something similar. They&#8217;re right. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://nephropal.blogspot.com/2009/09/vitamin-d-and-office-observations.html">what Nephropal said in 2009</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Vitamin D taken at night causes insomnia.</strong> This is a complaint of a few of my patients. Moreover, when they switch to morning dosing, the insomnia subsides. Thus, Vitamin D should be taken in the morning.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a great observation,  but not the same as Primal Girl&#8217;s. Here is <a href="http://www.primalgirl.com/2011/11/01/nprimalgirl-sleep-issues-vitamin-d/">her observation</a>, shortened for clarity:</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>I usually took my supplements mid-afternoon.</strong> I vowed to take them first thing every morning. <strong>I tried it the next day and that night I slept like a rock.</strong> And the next night. And the next.</p></blockquote>
<p>The two observations support each other. Both support the idea that the timing of Vitamin D matters. But there are also big differences. Paleo Girl had been taking her Vitamin D in mid-afternoon, not at night. She shifted to first thing in the morning, which is more specific than morning. I changed the title of yesterday&#8217;s title to make clearer what is new here: the idea that Vitamin D can substitute for sunlight.</p>
<p>Lots of things cause insomnia if you take them in the evening. Caffeine and other stimulants, for example. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/02/it-matters-when-you-take-vitamin-d-a-stunning-discovery/#comment-930503">A comment on yesterday&#8217;s post</a> said that B vitamins and calcium cause insomnia if taken in the evening. This is why Nephropal&#8217;s observation, although very important, is not a stunning surprise. You stop taking X in the evening, your sleep improves &#8212; I won&#8217;t be astonished, no matter what X is.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is not a stimulant or is at best a mild stimulant. Taking Vitamin D in the afternoon should not cause trouble sleeping. Yet Primal Girl had trouble sleeping. And she was getting little morning sunlight. It is a real insight that first-thing-in-the-morning Vitamin D could have the same effect as first-thing-in-the-morning sunlight &#8212; in other words, could substitute for missing sunlight. Against all odds, the results supported this idea.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/11/02/it-matters-when-you-take-vitamin-d-a-stunning-discovery/#comment-930453">One commenter</a> on yesterday&#8217;s post said Primal Girl&#8217;s results were both unproven and obvious. <em>Vitamin D is technically a hormone! Melatonin is a hormone,</em> said the comment. I have not heard anyone propose taking melatonin first thing in the morning to improve sleep. It is standard to take melatonin in the evening. The accepted view among circadian rhythm researchers is that sunlight produces its effects on circadian rhythms via nerves, not blood. For example, hundreds of experiments have found that destroying the suprachiasmatic nucleus of rats destroys their circadian rhythms.

<p>Lots of people think Vitamin D improves sleep. That&#8217;s not new. Here&#8217;s what one of them said, in a post promisingly titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.drbriffa.com/2010/03/16/when-is-the-best-time-to-take-your-vitamin-d-supplement/">When is the best time to take your Vitamin D supplement?</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an effort to boost absorption of vitamin D, individuals were asked to take their vitamin D supplements with the <em>largest meal of the day.</em> After 2-3 months, vitamin D levels were checked again.At the end of the study period, vitamin D levels had risen to an average of 47.2 ng/ml (118 nmol/l) – an average i<em>ncrease in vitamin D levels of about 57 per cent. . . </em>It seems sensible, I think, for individuals who are currently supplementing with vitamin D to take this with their largest evening meal.</p></blockquote>

					<p><a href="http://www.primalgirl.com/">Primal Girl</a> is a stay-at-home mom. I met her at the Ancestral Health Symposium. Her sleep was bad. I made recommendations. One of them was to get an hour of sunlight soon after you wake up. She can&#8217;t do that &#8212; too busy being a mom. So she decided to take Vitamin D early in the morning. After all, sunlight exposure produces Vitamin D. <a href="http://www.primalgirl.com/2011/11/01/nprimalgirl-sleep-issues-vitamin-d/">Here&#8217;s what happened</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One day as I was taking my supplements, I was thinking about how many units of Vitamin D your skin produces in 30 minutes of sun (20,000 I believe). I looked aghast at the 10,000 units of Vitamin D I was taking. It was 7 o’clock at night! I was essentially giving my body 15 minutes worth of bright sunlight energy. No wonder I was waking up in the middle of the night! I was telling my body that it wasn’t really time for bed, it was still the middle of the day. I wondered what would happen if I only took my Vitamin D first thing in the morning. It wouldn’t be an hour naked in the sun, but 15 minutes is better than nothing. That night I slept like shit. Worse than normal.</p>
<p><strong>I usually took my supplements mid-afternoon. I vowed to take them first thing every morning. </strong>If I forgot, I would not take the Vitamin D at all that day.<strong> I tried it the next day and that night I slept like a rock. And the next night. And the next. </strong>Days I forgot and skipped the D3, I still slept great.<strong> That was the only change I made </strong>to my lifestyle and <strong>my sleep issues completely resolved</strong>. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>OMG! Double OMG! Like Primal Girl, I have never heard anything like this. Even I am stunned that such a simple safe easy change could have such a positive effect. (Taking Vitamin D at sunrise is a lot easier than standing on one leg four times!) I&#8217;ve read lots about circadian rhythms. Many studies showed that a drug would be much more powerful at certain times of day. Most of these studies were with rats. It never occurred to me that the time you take a vitamin could matter so much.</p>

				<small>Monday, October 31st, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>For the last four years or so I have daily measured how well my brain is working by means of balance measurements and mental tests. For three years  I have used a test of simple arithmetic (e.g, 7 * 8, 2 + 5). I try to answer as fast as possible. I take faster answers to indicate a better-functioning brain.</p>
<p>Yesterday my score was much better than usual. This shows what happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-10-30-arithmetic-outlier-day2.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4402" title="2011-10-30 arithmetic outlier day" src="http://srblogfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-10-30-arithmetic-outlier-day2-1024x575.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>My usual average is about 550 msec or more; my score yesterday was 525 msec. An unexplained improvement of 25 msec. </p>
<p>What caused the improvement? I came up with a list of ways that yesterday was much different than usual, that is, was an outlier in other ways. These are possible causes. From more to less plausible:</p>
<p>1. I had 33 g extra flaxseed last night. (By mistake. I&#8217;m not sure about this.)</p>
<p>2. The test came at the perfect time after I had my afternoon yogurt with 33 g flaxseed. When I took flaxseed oil (now I eat ground flaxseed), it was clear that there was a short-term improvement for a few hours.</p>
<p>3. Many afternoons I eat 33 g ground flaxseed with yogurt. Yesterday I ground the afternoon flaxseed an unusually long time, making made the omega-3 more digestible.</p>
<p>4. I did kettlebells swings and a kettlebell walk about 2 hours before the test. These exercises are not new but usually I do them on different days. Yesterday was the first time I&#8217;ve done them on the same day. I&#8217;m sure ordinary walking improves performance for perhaps 30 minutes after I stop walking.</p>
<p>5. I had duck and miso soup a half-hour before the test. Almost never eat this.</p>
<p>6. I had a fermented egg (&#8220;thousand-year-old egg&#8221;) at noon. I rarely eat them.</p>
<p>7. I had peanuts with my yogurt and ground flaxseed. Peanuts alone seem to have no effect. Perhaps something in the peanuts improves digestion of the omega-3 in the flaxseed.</p>
<p>8. I started watching faces at 7 am that morning instead of 6:30 am or earlier.</p>
<p>Here are eight ideas to test. Perhaps one or two will turn out to be important. Perhaps none will.</p>
<p>After I made this list, I read student papers. The assignment was to comment on a research article. One of the articles was about the effect of holding a warm versus cold coffee cup. Holding a warm coffee cup makes you act &#8220;warmer,&#8221; said the article. Commenting on this, a student said she thought it was ridiculous until she remembered going to the barber. She sees the person who washes her hair (in warm water) as friendly, the barber as cold. Maybe this is due to the warm water used to wash her hair, she noted. This made me realize another unusual feature of yesterday: I had washed my hair in warm water longer than usual. I think I did it at least 30 minutes before the arithmetic test but I&#8217;m not sure. In any case, here is another idea to test. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/05/does-shower-temperature-affect-brain-speed/">I found earlier that cold showers slowed down my arithmetic speed</a>. </p>
<p>This illustrates a big advantage of personal science (science done for personal gain) over professional science (science done because it&#8217;s your job): The random variation in my life may suggest plausible new ideas. As far as I can tell, professional scientists have learned almost nothing about practical ways to make your brain work better. You can find many lists of &#8220;brain food&#8221; on the internet. Inevitably the evidence is weak. I&#8217;d be surprised if any of them helped more than a tiny amount (in my test, a few msec). The real brain foods, in my experience, are butter and omega-3. Perhaps my tests will merely confirm the value of omega-3 (Explanations 1-3). But perhaps not (Explanations 4-8 and head heating).</p>

				<small>Monday, October 24th, 2011</small>

					<p>I have had tea daily for the last ten years, ever since I discovered the Shangri-La Diet. A few weeks ago, I <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/17/willat-effect-experiments-with-tea/">started doing side-by-side comparisons of similar teas or the same tea prepared two ways</a> (e.g., different brewing times). Would <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/08/the-willat-effect-side-by-side-comparisons-create-connoisseurs/">the Willat Effect</a> make me a tea connoisseur?</p>
<p>Since then I have done at least one side-by-side comparison every day. It&#8217;s almost as easy as making an ordinary cup of tea and a lot more fun. These comparisons have taught me more about tea preparation than the previous ten years. I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<p>1. The black tea I have (an Earl-Grey variant) tastes better when brewed for 3.5 minutes than 4.0 minutes.</p>
<p>2. The black tea tastes better when I use 1.5 grams of tea than when I use 2.0 grams of tea. (After starting these comparisons, I bought <a href="http://www.camry.cn/products/Pocket-Scales-EHA901.htm">a scale for weighing tea</a>.)</p>
<p>3. One of the green teas I have tastes better when &#8220;rinsed&#8221; for 30 seconds before brewing 1 minute than when simply brewed for 1 minute. In China, this preference (rinse green tea before brewing) is common. I was reminded of it by <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/18/more-about-the-willat-effect/#comment-928868">this comment</a> and <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=2101">Paul Jaminet&#8217;s post about tea</a>. Black tea is different, as <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/10/18/more-about-the-willat-effect/">I noted earlier</a>.</p>
<p>4. I have a caffeine-free tea blend called <a href="http://www.americantearoom.com/choco-late-no-caffeine-tea.html">Choco Late</a> made of cacao husks, vanilla, and rooibos. The package says brew 5 minutes. Which is nonsense. It tastes better (fuller, more rounded) when brewed 30 minutes than when brewed 15 minutes. (I&#8217;ve noticed the same thing with caffeine-free chai blends. Enormous brewing times, like 60 minutes, produce much better results than short times.)</p>
<p>5. My most interesting discovery is when I brew Choco Late for 30 minutes it tastes so good I no longer want to sweeten it. It is pleasant enough already and sweetness would distract from the complexity, fullness, and slight bitterness. (At first I wrote &#8220;lovely complexity, fullness &#8230;&#8221;) I was shocked when I noticed this. It has never happened before.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tealula.com/blog/14/do-you-want-to-be-a-tea-connoisseur">This tea-selling website</a> mentions the Willat Effect under the heading &#8220;Do you want to be a tea connoisseur?&#8221; I hope this means the idea will spread among the fancy-food community. They have a lot to gain from better understanding of how to make people connoisseurs. Many times I have asked people in that community <em>what makes someone a connoisseur?</em> The usual answer is education. In my case, Willat-Effect comparisons (side-by-side comparisons of similar teas) were far more powerful than reading about tea, drinking a variety of teas, going on tea tours, going to ordinary tea tastings (where you taste a wide range of teas), and talking about tea with experts. I have been to five or six Fancy Food Shows and have visited thousands of booths. Exactly one booth offered side-by-side comparisons of similar products. It was their product made with and without a special ingredient.</p>
<p>Willat-Effect comparisons are mini-science. They aren&#8217;t quantitative but they include three other things central to science: 1. Close comparisons. This is the essence of experimentation. 2. You don&#8217;t know the answer. 3. You care about the answer.</p>

					<p><a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/07/08/the-willat-effect-side-by-side-comparisons-create-connoisseurs/">The Willat Effect</a> is the hedonic change caused by side-by-side comparison of similar things. Your hedonic response to the things compared (e.g., two or more dark chocolates) expands in both directions. The &#8220;better&#8221; things become more pleasant and the &#8220;worse&#8221; things become less pleasant. In my experience, it&#8217;s a big change, easy to notice.</p>
<p>I discovered the Willat Effect when my friend Carl Willat offered me five different limoncellos side by side. Knowing that he likes it, his friends had given them to him. Perhaps three were homemade, two store-bought. I&#8217;d had plenty of limoncello before that, but always one version at a time. Within seconds of tasting the five versions side by side, I came to like two of them (with more complex flavors) more than the rest. One or two of them I started to dislike. When you put two similar things next to each other, of course you see their differences more clearly. What&#8217;s impressive is the hedonic change.</p>
<p>The Willat Effect supports <a href="http://sethroberts.net/articles/2011-04-08%20How%20Economics%20Shaped%20Human%20Nature.pdf">my ideas about human evolution</a> because it pushes people toward connoisseurship. (I predict it won&#8217;t occur with animals.) The fact that repeating elements are found in so many decorating schemes and patterns meant to be pretty (e.g., wallpapers, textile patterns, rugs, choreography) suggests that we get pleasure from putting similar things side by side &#8212; the very state that produces the Willat Effect. According to my theory of human evolution, connoisseurship evolved because it created demand for hard-to-make goods, which helped the most skilled artisans make a living. Carl&#8217;s limoncello tasting made me a mini-connoisseur of limoncello. I started buying it much more often and  bought more expensive brands, thus helping the best limoncello makers make a living. Connoisseurs turn surplus into innovation by giving the most skilled artisans more time and freedom to innovate.</p>
<p>Does the Willat Effect have practical value? Could it improve my life? Recently I decided to see if it could make me a green tea connoisseur. Ever since I discovered the Shangri-La Diet (calories without smell), I&#8217;d been drinking tea (smell without calories) almost daily but I was no connoisseur. Nor had I done many side-by-side comparisons. At home, I had always made one cup at a time.</p>
<p>In Beijing, where I am now, I can easily buy many green teas. I got three identical tea pots (SAMA SAG-08) and three cheap green teas. I drink tea every morning. Instead of brewing one pot, I started making two or three pots at the same time and comparing the results. I compared different teas and the same tea brewed different lengths of time (Carl&#8217;s idea).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this about two weeks. The results so far:</p>
<p>1. The cheapest tea became undrinkable. I decided to never buy it again and not to drink the  rest of my purchase. I will use it for kombucha. Two of the three teas cost about twice the cheapest one. After a few side by side comparisons I liked the more expensive ones considerably more than the cheaper one. The two more expensive ones cost about the same but, weirdly, I liked the one that cost (slightly) more a little better than the one that cost less. (Tea is sold in bulk with no packaging or branding so the price I pay is closely related to what the grower was paid. The buyers taste it and decide what it&#8217;s worth.)</p>
<p>2. I decided to infuse the tea leaves only once. (Usual practice is to infuse green tea two or more times.)  The quality of later infusions was too low, I decided. Before this, I had found second and later infusions had been acceptable.</p>
<p>The Willat Effect is working, in other words. After a decade of drinking tea, my practices suddenly changed.  I will buy different teas and brew them differently. I will spend a lot more per cup since (a) each cup will require fresh tea, (b) I won&#8217;t buy the cheapest tea, and (c) I have become far more interested in green tea, partly because each cup tastes better, partly because I am curious if more expensive varieties taste better. When I bought the three varieties I have now I didn&#8217;t bother to learn their names; I identified them by price. In the future I will learn the names.</p>
<p>To get the Willat Effect, the things being compared must be quite similar. For example, comparing green tea with black tea does nothing. I have learned a methodological lesson: That tea is a great medium for studying this not only because it&#8217;s cheap but also because you can easily get similar tasting teas by brewing the same tea different lengths of time. I haven&#8217;t yet tried different water temperatures but that too might work.</p>
<p>I have done similar things before. I bought several versions of orange marmalade, did side-by-side tastings, and indeed became an orange marmalade connoisseur. After that I bought only expensive versions. After a few side-by-side comparisons of cheese that included expensive cheeses, I stopped buying cheap cheese. You could say I am still an orange marmalade and cheese connoisseur but this has no effect on my current life. Because I avoid sugar, I don&#8217;t eat orange marmalade. Because of all the butter I eat, I rarely eat cheese. My budding green tea connoisseurship, however, <strong>is</strong> making a  difference because I drink tea every day.</p>

				<small>Monday, August 29th, 2011</small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>In <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/08/my-n1-quest-to-live-headache-free/">this post</a>, Alexandra Carmichael describes how she recently figured out what caused most of her headaches. She had suffered from frequent headaches for twenty years. One source was dairy. She confirmed this source when eating 1/4 stick of butter gave her a splitting headache. Another source was gluten. She got the idea that gluten might matter from the <a href="http://curetogether.com/migraine/treatments/">CureTogether list of migraine treatments</a>. A final source turned out to be Febreze, as I mentioned in <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/08/13/more-migraine-headaches-caused-by-cleaning-products/">an earlier post</a>.</p>
<p>You might marvel that conventional healthcare (e.g., doctors, the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/">Mayo Clinic website</a>, and so on) was no help. Or you might not. In the case of <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/finding-the-source-of-migraines-and-fifty-useless-migraine-drugs.html">the woman I wrote about for Boing Boing</a>, her conventional doctors actively got in the way of helping her find the source of her migraines. Alexandra takes ibuprofen for her headaches. So conventional healthcare (in this case, the makers of ibuprofen) has managed to <strong>profit</strong> from every one of her headaches but hasn&#8217;t done one useful thing to prevent them. A nasty state of affairs (provide expensive relief of symptoms, ignore prevention and underlying causes, thus ensuring that people continue to get sick and need relief) that is repeated a thousand places in our healthcare system (e.g., in depression, cancer, etc.).</p>
<p>At the First QS Conference, I gave a talk that included the following equation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">progress = resources*knowledge*time*freedom*motivation</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I used this equation to explain why mainstream medicine was stagnating, but personal science was not. Personal scientists (individuals trying to improve their own health) seem tiny and insignificant compared to medical school professors with million-dollar grants and large labs. But the visible superiority of medical school professors &#8212; they have far more resources and knowledge than personal scientists, not to mention more prestige &#8212; masks an enormous hidden inferiority: Personal scientists have far more time, freedom, and motivation than medical school professors. And personal scientists are rapidly gaining more resources and knowledge. This is why, in terms of progress, they are catching up to and surpassing mainstream healthcare.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Alexandra&#8217;s story illustrates the pattern. In this case, personal science made progress (it eliminated most of her headaches), mainstream healthcare did not (it eliminated none of them). And the success of personal science depended on increases in resources and increases in knowledge. A new resource that helped Alexandra was a DailyBurn iPhone app that helped her track what she ate. From those records she noticed a curious pattern: that <strong>changes</strong> in how much dairy she ate caused trouble. Two new sources of knowledge also helped her. The accumulation of knowledge at CureTogether led to her to suspect gluten was one of her triggers. And my story in Boing Boing led to her to suspect that Febreze and other cleaning products were triggers.</p>

					<p>I recently heard Tucker Max speak about writing books. He said he had succeeded because he told the truth about himself &#8212; including the unpleasant stuff. Most people don&#8217;t. That, plus an ability to make it entertaining, was what he could do that other people couldn&#8217;t. He was saying that &#8220;being yourself&#8221; &#8212; more precisely, building on how you are different &#8212; was the only good place to start. Imitating other people is not a good place to start. Jane Jacobs said the same thing about how cities should develop. She said it was pointless to try to imitate other cities &#8212; to imitate them by building a stadium or convention center, for example. Each city should figure out what its unique strengths are &#8212; what makes Springfield Springfield &#8212; and build on them.

					<p>A few days ago, Dominic Andriacchi, a 25-year-old law student living near Detroit, told me that he mentioned some of my self-experimentation (<a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866">my discovery that postponing breakfast reduced insomnia</a>) in an Amazon ebook (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Law-School-Livin-ebook/dp/B005GVCRHM">Law School Livin&#8217;</a></em>) he&#8217;d just published. He added that something he read in this blog really helped him:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you for introducing me to flaxseed oil.  Recently, I re-injured my back (a injury that occurred during college football).  While I&#8217;ve never seen a doctor for the injury, I did a little internet searching and figured that I had herniated a disk in my lower back.  I also had pain in my leg due to, I presume, pressure on the sciatic nerve from the herniated disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>He re-injured his back pulling a small tree uphill.</p>
<blockquote><p>Usually, it takes at least a week for the pain to go away.  I have trouble sitting, walking, and so forth.  That day, because I [had] read <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/11/05/omega-3-and-sports-injuries/">the post of Tucker Max&#8217;s ankle injury and flaxseed oil</a>, I immediately upped my flaxseed oil to a total of 15 1000mg capsules.  The next day, there was nearly no pain at all.  I could bend over and touch my toes with only the slightest pain.  The day after that, I was back to normal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later he added some details:</p>
<blockquote><p>I took 15 capsules of flaxseed oil [the day of the injury] to see what would happen.  There was no immediate benefit that I felt that day, but the next day it was great.  Even sitting or the slightest bending can cause a lot of pain, but I was able to bend over and nearly touch my toes.  I took another 10 capsules that day as well.  The day after that, I was completely pain free.  I took more flaxseed oil capsules even though I was experiencing no pain at all.  I expected the pain to come back, but it didn&#8217;t.  From then on, I would just take my normal two flaxseed oil capsules [per day].  I was spacing them out, 5 at a time in between meals.</p></blockquote>

<li><strong>Inflammation</strong>. I would like to measure the redness of my gums. This is possible (take photo, measure redness), but hard.</li>
<li><strong>The effects of fermented foods</strong>, especially their effect on my immune system. I believe fermented foods differ greatly in potency but I am unable to do any quantification.</li>
</ol>
