				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/books/review/charles-dickens-biographies-review.html?_r=1&amp;nl=books&amp;emc=booksupdateema4&amp;pagewanted=all">a review of biographies of Charles Dickens</a> I found this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 1849 he showed a short account of his early years to his close friend John Forster, revealing a story he never told his own family: the shame-inducing months he spent, while his father was in a debtor’s prison, as a 12-year-old “laboring hind” in a factory that bottled shoe-blacking.</p>
<p>Suddenly I understood why he wrote <em>Oliver Twist</em> and why it is so good. Budding writers are told <em>write what you know</em>. They should be told <em>write what you feel bad about</em>.</p>
<p>The work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Pennebaker" target="_blank">James Pennebaker</a> has shown the benefits  of even small amounts of self-disclosure. No doubt this is why all sorts of psychotherapy, supposedly based on enormously different theories, help roughly the same amount: All involve self-disclosure. I see this effect as something built into us by evolution  to increase self-disclosure. Talking about bad experiences helps your listeners avoid what happened to you. To motivate such disclosures, evolution has built into us something that causes us to feel better after we talk this way.</p>
<p>Scientists are not told <em>study what you know </em>and they are <strong>especially</strong> not told <em>study what you feel bad about</em>. Scientists are mostly men, of course, and that sort of thing makes men uncomfortable. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">My personal science</a>, however, suggests the correctness of this idea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several people have said that bedtime honey made them wake up too early. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2014/01/14/bedtime-honey-is-a-godsend/#comment-1168304" target="_blank">For example</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>No effect for me, worse for my wife (hours of wakefulness in the middle of the night after a few hours of sleep)</p></blockquote>
<p>The commenter said this meant it wasn&#8217;t working.</p>
<p>My view is different. To me, this experience suggests that there is something safe, cheap and practical (honey) that has a powerful and non-intuitive effect on sleep. Finding something like that is extremely hard. (Drug companies have spent billions of dollars trying to do this, with far worse results.) It isn&#8217;t easy or obvious or trivial to learn how to use that powerful force to produce improvement rather than harm (&#8220;hours of wakefulness in the middle of the night&#8221;), but I am sure it is possible.</p>
<p>My first important use of self-experimentation was in graduate school. I discovered that one of the medicines my dermatologist had prescribed for my acne wasn&#8217;t working. The notion that a prescribed medicine didn&#8217;t work is useful, but not shocking. This success was enough to launch me into self-experimentation to improve my sleep &#8212; specifically, to reduce early awakening. This turned out to be very hard.</p>
<p>After ten years of trial and error (all error), <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/" target="_blank">I discovered something</a> that made my early awakening reliably <strong>worse</strong>. I was thrilled. After ten years, something finally made a difference, albeit in the wrong direction. It was a turning point. I did many experiments and finally figured out that any breakfast made my sleep worse. This was far more progress than finding out that a prescribed medicine didn&#8217;t work. It was progress because (a) nutrition experts usually said that breakfast was &#8220;the most important meal of the day&#8221;. My discovery flatly contradicted that. I became a lot more skeptical of experts, a view that has served me well. (b) Eliminating breakfast greatly reduced early awakening, and (c) the discovery showed that self-experimentation could do better than expert advice in surprising ways. My interesting self-experimentation began with the discovery of something that made my sleep worse.</p>
<p>I too have found that although I am sleeping much better, bedtime honey and other evening sugars have also made me wake up too early more often. I too need to learn how to better use this new knowledge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I discovered that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2010/09/seth-roberts-on-arithmetic-and/">butter made me faster at arithmetic</a>, I started eating half a stick (66 g) of butter per day. After a talk about it, a cardiologist in the audience said I was killing myself. I said that the evidence that butter improved my brain function was much clearer than the evidence that butter causes heart disease. The cardiologist couldn&#8217;t debate this; he seemed to have no idea of the evidence.</p>
<p>Shortly before I discovered the butter/arithmetic connection, I had a heart scan (a tomographic x-ray) from which is computed an Agaston score, a measure of calcification of your blood vessels. The Agaston score is a good predictor of whether you will have a heart attack. The higher your score, the greater the probability. My score put me close to the median for my age. A year later &#8212; after eating lots of butter every day during that year &#8212; I got a second scan. Most people get about 25% worse each year.  My second scan showed regression (= improvement). It was 40% better (less) than expected (a 25% increase). A big increase in butter consumption was the only aspect of my diet that I consciously changed between Scan 1 and Scan 2.</p>
<p>The improvement I observed, however surprising, was consistent with <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/80/5/1175.full" target="_blank">a 2004 study</a> that measured narrowing of the arteries as a function of diet. About 200 women were studied for three years. There were three main findings. 1. <strong>The more saturated fat, the less narrowing</strong>. Women in the highest quartile of saturated fat intake didn&#8217;t have, on average, any narrowing. 2. <strong>The more polyunsaturated fat, the more narrowing</strong>. 3. <strong>The more carbohydrate, the more narrowing</strong>. Of all the nutrients examined, only saturated fat clearly reduced narrowing. Exactly the opposite of what we&#8217;ve been told.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/print/21896">this article</a> explains, the original idea that fat causes heart disease came from Ancel Keys, who omitted most of the available data from his data set. When all the data were considered, there was no connection between fat intake and heart disease. There has never been convincing evidence that saturated fat causes heart disease, but somehow this hasn&#8217;t stopped the vast majority of doctors and nutrition experts from repeating what they&#8217;ve been told.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1995, I discovered that <a href="http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866" target="_blank">seeing faces in the morning raised my mood the next day</a>. For example, seeing faces Monday morning improved my mood on Tuesday (but not Monday). Study of the effect suggested we have a face-sensitive oscillator that controls mood and sleep. The oscillator needs morning-face exposure to work properly &#8212; faces &#8220;push&#8221; the oscillator as you would push a swing. Long ago, this oscillator synchronized the mood and sleep of people who lived together. The synchronization helped them cooperate. It is much easier to work with a happy person than an unhappy person and, of course, much easier to work with someone awake than someone asleep.</p>
<p>My results suggested you need to see morning faces on the order of 30 minutes to get a big effect. The faces need to be similar to what you&#8217;d see in a conversation. Looking at people on the subway doesn&#8217;t count. Nowadays, as far as I can tell, hardly anyone gets the right input. In extreme cases, this causes <span style="font-size: 13px;">depression, poor sleep, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. What else might it cause? <span id="more-3770"></span></span></p>
<p>A friend, whom I&#8217;ll call Ben, recently told me something that sheds light on this. Three years ago he was a graduate student at Columbia. He lived in a basement apartment, with no sunlight. It was between semesters. He had no regular contact with anyone. He was depressed. Then things got worse:  He became delusional. He started thinking that every conversation he heard was about him. &#8220;Everything I heard or saw was directed at me,&#8221; he said. There was a boiler in the room next to his apartment. He believed it was a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>Although Ben was isolated in terms of seeing other people, he had non-visual contact with people online. He told them about his strange thoughts. Some thought he had a problem, some didn&#8217;t. Some thought he sounded mystical. He felt physical discomfort &#8212; a &#8220;pulling inside&#8221;. His heart seemed to be beating differently. He called his parents. They were so alarmed that they contacted someone they knew in New York. Eventually an ambulance arrived at Ben&#8217;s apartment and took him to a mental hospital. At the hospital, he told them he thought he was dead. After a day or so at the hospital, on a locked ward, he felt much better. However, he wasn&#8217;t allowed to leave for two weeks because the doctors didn&#8217;t know what was wrong with him.</p>
<p>After leaving the hospital he took a break from graduate school and went to stay with his parents. He saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risperidone" target="_blank">Risperdal</a> (an antipsychotic) and Depakote (for mania).</p>
<p>The pattern is okay during semester (when he sees others on campus), sick between semesters (when he doesn&#8217;t see others), okay in locked ward (when he sees others). Bipolar disorder sometimes includes delusions during mania, so the association of disordered internal rhythms and delusions is not new. But why should disordered internal rhythms cause delusions &#8212; in this case, paranoid ones? One possibility is that it is beneficial to be paranoid in the middle of the night. If someone wakes you up, you will wake up thinking they <em>tried</em> to wake you up, which will make you especially mad. The madder you are, the less likely they will do it again. I argued that the irritability associated with depression is beneficial in the middle of the night for just this reason: It protects sleep. If someone wakes you up you will get mad at them. This explanation predicts a circadian rhythm in paranoia, increasing in the evening. However, I&#8217;m not sure this explains why he thought a boiler in the next room was a nuclear reactor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I gave a talk at a Quantified Self Meetup in San Francisco titled &#8220;Why is my blood sugar high?&#8221; (PowerPoint <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/?attachment_id=10770" target="_blank">here</a> and <a "href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10760363/2013-06-26%20Why%20is%20My%20Blood%20Sugar%20High.pptx" target="_blank">here</a>). My main point was that alternate-day fasting (eating much less than usual every other day) quickly brought my fasting blood sugar level from the mid-90s to the low 80s, which is where I wanted it. I was unsure how to do this and had tried several things that hadn&#8217;t worked.</p>
<p>Not in the talk is an explanation of my results in terms of setpoint (blood sugar setpoint, not body fat setpoint). Your body tries to maintain a certain blood sugar level &#8212; that&#8217;s obvious. Not obvious at all is what controls the setpoint. This question is usually ignored &#8212; for example, in Wikipedia&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_regulation" target="_blank">blood sugar regulation</a> entry. Maybe Type 2 diabetes occurs because the blood sugar setpoint is too high. If we can find out what environmental events control the setpoint, we will be in a much better position to prevent and reverse Type 2 diabetes (as with obesity).</p>
<p>A few years ago, I discovered that <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/" target="_blank">walking an hour per day improved my fasting blood sugar</a>. Does walking lower the setpoint? I didn&#8217;t ask this question, a curious omission from the author of <em>The Shangri-La Diet</em>. If walking lowered the setpoint, walking every other day might have the same effect as walking every day.</p>
<p>I was pushed toward this line of thought because alternate-day fasting seems to lower the blood-sugar setpoint. After I started alternate-day fasting, it took about three days for my fasting blood sugar to reach a new lower level. After that, it was low every day, not just after fast days. My experience suggests that the blood-sugar setpoint depends on what your blood sugar is. When your blood sugar is high, the setpoint becomes higher; when your blood sugar is low, the setpoint becomes lower. Tim Lundeen had told me something similar to this.</p>
<p>If you tried to lower your fasting blood sugar and succeeded, I hope you will say in the comments how you did this. I tried three things that didn&#8217;t work: darker bedroom, Vitamin B supplement, and cinnamon. Eating low carb raises<strong> </strong>fasting blood sugar, <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2011/11/safe-starches-symposium-dr-ron-rosedale/" target="_blank">according to Paul Jaminet</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend I attended <a href="http://www.the-eg.com/" target="_blank">EG</a>, a TED-like conference in Monterey. One of the speakers, a woman named <a href="http://www.redhongyi.com/" target="_blank">Hong Yi</a>, made representational art from cheap materials  &#8211; a portrait from coffee-stained napkins, for example. The most stirring talks were by Matt Harding (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwe-pA6TaZk&amp;noredirect=1" target="_blank">dancing video</a>) and Jo Montgomery and Chuck Johnson (<a href="http://www.sancaseattle.org/" target="_blank">circus school</a>) but she, more than anyone else, seemed to have done something with big implications. Her art was attractive, profitable, very cheap, and diverse (many materials, many representational styles). If anyone else has ever done this, I don&#8217;t know about it. She is an architect in Shanghai and her art began because she was in China. At a wholesale supply store, she came across very cheap candles. She realized she could buy enough of them to make a picture with one candle = one pixel. I imagine people will be watching Harding&#8217;s video a hundred years from now and the underlying point of Montgomery and Johnson&#8217;s circus school will be valid forever, but both were enormous expensive unique efforts. Hong&#8217;s work was much easier and cost almost nothing. The benefit/cost ratio was very high and millions of people could do something like what she did.</p>
<p>I realized that my work resembled hers. <span id="more-10277"></span>She had discovered how to make cheap good art &#8212; not just once but many times, using a wide range of materials (e.g., different foods) and representational styles. I had figured out how to do cheap good science, answering not just one question (e.g., how to sleep better) but many questions (how to sleep better, how to lose weight, how to be in a better mood, etc.). My science cost almost nothing, so I could do a lot of it (do thousands of experiments) and managed to discover many things. In both Hong Yi&#8217;s case and mine, the Internet was not needed to do the work but was essential for publicizing it. It didn&#8217;t fit the usual channels.</p>
<p>For a long time, I called my work <em>self-experimentation</em>. It&#8217;s true, but misleading, because almost all self-experimentation you&#8217;ve heard of isn&#8217;t like mine. The book <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Who_Goes_First.html?id=V1jwt-P8FjoC" target="_blank"><em>Who Goes First? The Story of Self-Experimentation in Medicine</em></a> is full of self-experimentation quite different than mine. Most of it is by doctors, designed to show that a new treatment is safe. The scientist tries the treatment himself to protect others. The self-experimentation in <em>Who Goes First?</em> is closer to demonstration than experiment. In contrast, the treatments I&#8217;ve studied (e.g., butter, morning faces, standing a lot) are perfectly safe. My work is about finding new ideas. It is about changing my own beliefs, not trying to convince other people of what I believe.</p>
<p>More recently, I might describe my work by saying it&#8217;s an example of the Quantified Self (QS) movement. Again, this is true, but also somewhat misleading. My work does involve self-quantification and self-tracking.  Like many QSers, I do hope to become healthier as a result. What&#8217;s misleading is that the tracking is only part of the effort, I don&#8217;t measure many things, and my tracking isn&#8217;t high-tech. I&#8217;m trying to discover new cause-effect relationships (e.g., new ways to improve sleep). This is not a large part of the QS conversation.</p>
<p>If I describe my work as<em>cheap science</em>, on the other hand, what you automatically think of is pretty accurate. Scientists look for cause-effect relationships (it is central to science); I look for cause-effect relationships. Scientists do many experiments; so do I. Scientists pay great attention to the scientific literature (what has already been done, what is already known); so do I. When something becomes much cheaper (e.g., photography or computing becomes much cheaper), everyone understands that the activity can be done by many more people. That is inherent in my work. I am doing science that many people can do &#8212; many more people than can do professional science. The terms <em>self-experimentation</em> and <em>quantified self</em> do not convey this.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em></em>Like the term <em>cheap travel</em>, the term <em>cheap science</em> suggests freedom. That too is a big part of what I do. I have vastly more freedom than professional scientists. I can test treatments they can&#8217;t. I can entertain ideas (&#8220;crazy&#8221;) they can&#8217;t. I can spend longer on one project than they can. So if I describe what I do as <em>cheap science, </em>the rest of what I say (&#8220;I&#8217;ve discovered new ways to sleep better, lose weight, etc.&#8221;) makes more sense. And maybe the whole activity sounds more accessible, whereas self-experimentation and quantified self seem like the sort of activities that caused the word <em>geek</em> to be invented.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reader with an autistic son sent me a link to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/magazine/the-boy-with-a-thorn-in-his-joints.html?&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">a story in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em></a> by Susannah Meadows about a boy with arthritis who was cured by dietary changes, including omega-3 and probiotics. Conventional doctors and the boy&#8217;s father had resisted trying the dietary solution; Meadows is the boy&#8217;s mother.  An expert in the boy&#8217;s problem, Dr. Lisa Imundo, director of pediatric rheumatology at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, told Meadows that &#8220;she [Imundo] had treated thousands of kids with arthritis . . .  and diet changes did not work.&#8221; It took only six weeks of the dietary change to discover it did work. Eventually the boy&#8217;s arthritis was completely gone. It may have been caused by antibiotics he&#8217;d been given for pneumonia. The antibiotics may have killed his gut flora making his intestines too permeable.</p>
<p>Had Meadows accepted what mainstream doctors told her, her son would have taken medicine for the rest of his life &#8212; medicine that wasn&#8217;t working well. Dr. Imundo wanted to double the dose.</p>
<p>The reader with an autistic son explained how it related to this blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>It particularly supports the value of self-experimentation in these chronic conditions, especially when there is heterogeneity. The heterogeneity of autism was obvious to me from early on, although I&#8217;ve come to realize it&#8217;s not obvious to everyone else. Autisms of known genetic causes have different tracks (Fragile X is the best-studied). Broad studies of autism start with a huge disadvantage: they are studying different disorders of similar presentation, and what helps in one case may harm in another. After the steady drip drip of your talking about n=1 experiments, it dawned on me that this applied to our situation. You didn&#8217;t need to do a massive, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of acne medication any more than I needed to enroll a thousand families in a study of diet and autism. I could start with dinner.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reader found dietary n=1 experimentation with her son to be very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>. After I wrote this, Michelle Francl, a chemist who writes for for Slate&#8217;s Medical Examiner column, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/02/curing_chemophobia_don_t_buy_the_alternative_medicine_in_the_boy_with_a.html" target="_blank">complained about the &#8220;alternative medicine&#8221; in Meadow&#8217;s piece</a>. Francl fails to mention that dietary changes completely cured the problem, thus avoiding the need for dangerous drugs that weren&#8217;t working. Francl says that Meadows has &#8220;an irrational fear of chemicals&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stagnation of innovation is often illustrated with kitchens. In 1996, <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/WondersofTechnologyNotSoWonderous.html" target="_blank">Paul Krugman</a> wrote, &#8220;I live in a house with a late-50s-vintage kitchen, never remodeled. The non-self-defrosting refrigerator, and the gas range with its open pilot lights . . .  it is still a pretty functional kitchen.&#8221; (Illustrating, at least, his lack of change.) <a href="http://tylercowen.com/tag/the-great-stagnation/" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen</a> said &#8220;if he were to introduce his grandmother to a modern American kitchen, it wouldn’t be all that earth-shattering for her.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/opinion/brooks-where-are-the-jobs.html?_r=0" target="_blank">David Brooks </a>mentioned lack of innovation in many things, including &#8220;appliances&#8221;. Last week, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21569381-idea-innovation-and-new-technology-have-stopped-driving-growth-getting-increasing" target="_blank">the</a> <em>Economist</em> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Take kitchens. In 1900 kitchens in even the poshest of households were primitive things. . . . Fast forward to 1970 and middle-class kitchens in America and Europe feature gas and electric hobs [= burners] and ovens, fridges, food processors, microwaves and dishwashers. Move forward another 40 years, though, and things scarcely change.</p></blockquote>
<p>For a long time I wanted to go to the giant kitchen and housewares trade show in Chicago every summer, until <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/garden/10housewares.html?pagewanted=all">this article</a> convinced it would be the same old stuff with tiny variations.</p>
<p>In contrast, my kitchen has changed greatly in the last ten years. Here&#8217;s how:<span id="more-2216"></span></p>
<p>1. <strong>Tea-brewing equipment</strong>. Soon after I started practicing the Shangri-La Diet (calories without smell), I started drinking lots of tea (smell without calories).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Electric tea kettle</strong> (heats water for tea better than microwave).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Kitchen scale</strong> (for tea and flaxseed). I discovered that flaxseed oil and, later, ground flaxseed improved my brain function and gums.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Noseclips</strong>. For the Shangri-La Diet.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Yogurt maker</strong>. I believe that fermented foods are essential for health.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Kombucha brewing tools</strong> (e.g., glass jars).</p>
<p>7. <strong>Spice grinder</strong> (for flax seed).</p>
<p>8. <strong>Soup cooker</strong> (for pork belly and miso soup). Eating lots of pork belly improved my sleep.</p>
<p>I would like to make more fermented foods. I hear that in South Korea I can get a machine that makes both natto and yogurt.</p>
<p>My kitchen changed because my ideas about health changed. My ideas about health changed because of my research.  I found a new way to lose weight. I had a new explanation of why we like foods with complex, sour, and unami flavors (so that we will eat more fermented food). Self-experimentation convinced me that I was seriously omega-3-deficient, thus the flaxseeds. I discovered that if I eat a lot of animal fat, I sleep better.</p>
<p>I believe kitchen stagnation reflects stagnation in our thinking about health. Every October, I point out that the Nobel Prize in Medicine has again been given to research that is so far useless.  &#8220;Molecular medicine has come nowhere close to matching the effects of improved sanitation,&#8221; says the Economist. Could mainstream health researchers be trapped by their desires to show off (no cheap equipment), to be respected (no &#8220;crazy ideas&#8221;), and to produce a steady stream of publications (no time to test implausible ideas)? Could having goals other than the truth (such as respectability) make it harder to find the truth? People who have written about stagnation in innovation do not seem to have considered these possibilities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To do personal science well, what should you learn?</p>
<p>Professional scientists learn how to do science mostly in graduate school, mostly by imitation, although they might take a statistics class. Personal scientists rarely have anyone to imitate, so have more need to understand basic principles. There are five skills/dimensions that matter. Here are a few comments about each one:<span id="more-8490"></span></p>
<p>1. <strong>Motivation</strong>. In conventional science, the scientist does it as part of a job and subjects are paid. Neither works here: It isn&#8217;t a job and you can&#8217;t pay yourself. My original motivation was wanting to learn how to do experiments (for my job &#8212; experimental psychologist). After I discovered how useful it could be, I started doing personal science to solve actual problems, including early awakening and overweight. On these two subjects (sleep and weight control) conventional scientists seemed to have made and be making little progress, with a few exceptions (such as Sclafani, Cabanac, and Ramirez) in the area of weight control. Here my motivation was lack of plausible alternatives. Now I now see personal science like playing the lottery, except it costs almost nothing. Most of the time nothing happens, once in a long while there is a big payoff. An example of the lottery-like payoff is that for ten years I measured my sleep, trying to figure out what was causing my early awakening. One day it suddenly got worse (when I changed my breakfast). That led me to realize many things. Another example is I measured my brain function with an arithmetic test for several years. One day it suddenly improved (due to butter).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Measurement</strong>. Conventional scientists almost always use already-established measures because they improve communication. In contrast, a personal scientist wants a measure that is especially sensitive to the problem (e.g., insomnia) to be solved or the question to be answered (e.g., did flaxseed oil improve my balance?). Communication is much less important. Psychologists use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" target="_blank">Likert scales</a> (rating scales with 5 or 7 possible answers) to measure internal states but they almost always use inexperienced and unmotivated subjects. When I&#8217;ve measured internal states (e.g., mood), I have a lot of motivation and eventually have a lot of experience and find I can make much finer distinctions. Unlike conventional research, I care enormously about the convenience of the measurement. For example, it should be brief.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Treatment choice</strong>. You don&#8217;t want to do a lot of experiments that don&#8217;t find any effect, so you need to choose wisely the treatments you test. Scanning the internet (what has cured insomnia?) and reading scientific papers (what are standard treatments for insomnia?) hasn&#8217;t worked for me, although it&#8217;s better to try anything than to try nothing. One thing that&#8217;s worked is to test large surprising effects I hear about. An example is Tara Grant&#8217;s discovery that restricting her Vitamin D to the morning improved her sleep. Also successful is measuring the problem for a long time, in search of outliers. When the problem suddenly gets better or worse, I test whatever unusual happened just before that. For example, when I switched from oatmeal breakfast to fruit breakfast, my early awakening suddenly got worse. I started testing various breakfasts. A third successful strategy is to combine the first two strategies with evolutionary thinking, giving bonus points if the treatment I&#8217;m thinking of testing provides something present in Stone Age life but absent now. For example, this is one reason I decided to test the effect of standing a lot. Stone Age people must have been on their feet more than most of us.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Experimental design</strong>. The hard part is knowing how fast the treatment effect rises and falls. If it rises and falls quickly, your experiment should be very different than if it rises and falls slowly. In most cases, what I study rises and falls slowly and the best design is some variation of ABA. Do A for several days, do B for several days, do A for several days. It is much easier to do a condition for too few days than too many so I try to err on the side of too many days. The hardest lesson to learn was to realize how little I know and avoid complex designs with untested assumptions.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Data analysis</strong>. Statistics books and classes emphasize statistical tests, whereas in practice what matters are simple graphs (e.g., what you measure versus time). I make one or more new graphs every time I collect new data (e.g., I make a plot of my weight versus time every time I weigh myself)  but rarely do <em>t </em>tests and the like. I&#8217;ve learned to make several graphs at different time scales (e.g., last week, last month, etc.), not just one graph.</p>
<p>I believe these factors combine in a multiplicative way to determine how much you learn. If any is poor, you will learn little. They provide a way of asking yourself what you&#8217;ve learned after you&#8217;ve done some personal science. For example, <em>where did I get the idea for the treatment</em>? Presumably, with experience, you slowly get better at each of them.</p>
<p>Thanks to Brian Toomey for encouraging me to write this. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have recently encountered three examples that suggest low-carb diets don&#8217;t work well long-term:</p>
<p>1. Alex Chernavsky <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">tried a low-carb diet in 2002</a>. Starting at 270 pounds, he lost 70 pounds. A year later, he started to rapidly regain the lost weight. He stopped the diet.</p>
<p>2. A &#8220;medical professional&#8221; <a href="http://www.livinlowcarbdiscussion.com/showthread.php?tid=9606" target="_blank">started at about 260 pounds</a> (she&#8217;s 5&#8217;3&#8243;).  After reading <em>Wheat Belly,</em> she gave up wheat. &#8220;After several months of being wheat free I lost 10 lbs. But that&#8217;s where it stopped.&#8221; Then she did  full low-carb. &#8220;From May to July I did what basically was Atkins induction. I lost 20 lbs but then the weight loss stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/" target="_blank">Jimmy Moore</a> lost a lot of weight eating low-carb. Starting in 2004 at 410 pounds, he lost 180 pounds. Then he gained half of it back, ending up near 300 pounds in early 2012. <span id="more-8463"></span></p>
<p>The theory behind the Shangri-La Diet (SLD) says unfamiliar food will cause weight loss because its smell is not (yet) associated with calories. As the food becomes familiar, its smell becomes associated with calories. Weight loss due to unfamiliarity will disappear. Going low-carb usually involves eating unfamiliar foods. They become familiar. This explains low-carb weight regain. The theory explains partial low-carb success (e.g., Jimmy Moore didn&#8217;t regain all the lost weight) by assuming that the high-carb foods (e.g., soft drinks) given up produced stronger smell-calorie associations than the low-carb foods (e.g., steak) that replaced them.</p>
<p>Recently Jimmy Moore <a href="http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/blog/n1" target="_blank">has been losing weight again</a>. Starting at 306 pounds, over 7 months he has lost 60 pounds. He believes that to lose weight with a low-carb diet, there must be sufficient ketones in your blood &#8212; you must be at the optimal level of ketosis. &#8220;In order to be fully keto-adapted and to start burning stored body fat for fuel, ketone levels must be between 0.5 to 3.0 millimolar,&#8221; he wrote. To be fully keto-adapted, he began measuring his ketone level regularly.  His first test showed that his ketone level was 0.3. &#8220;Holy cow, that could be one of the reasons why I’m not seeing my weight go down!&#8221; he wrote. He began adjusting his diet to put his ketone level between 0.5 and 3.0 millimolar, which involved changing protein intake as well as carb intake.</p>
<p>He changed his diet in various ways (mainly protein reduction) and started losing weight. In what I&#8217;ve read, he does not describe his current diet or earlier diet in detail,  but does <a href="http://livinlavidalowcarb.com/blog/jimmy-moores-n1-experiments-nutritional-ketosis-day-1-30/14409" target="_blank">say this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I will tell you that I’ve drank liberal amounts of water and 2 Tbs Carlson’s liquid fish oil daily along with my regular daily vitamins during this experiment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which sounds exactly like the Shangri-La Diet. Alex Chernavsky lost considerable weight and has kept it off <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2012/03/13/ten-years-of-weights-including-two-years-on-the-shangri-la-diet/" target="_blank">doing almost the same thing with flaxseed oil</a>.</p>
<p>My guess is that he is losing weight because of the fish oil. The theory behind SLD makes two predictions: 1. If Jimmy stops the fish oil and continues the ketone level adjustment, he will stop losing weight. 2. If Jimmy stops the ketone level adjustment but continues the fish oil, he will continue losing weight.</p>
<p>I asked Jimmy for comment. Here&#8217;s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s an interesting theory, but not one I want to particularly test out since I&#8217;m still doing so well at accomplishing what I am aiming for right now&#8211;fat loss, mental acuity and great overall health [all due to the fish oil, I believe -- Seth]. Perhaps once this period of testing NK [nutritional ketosis] is over in May, I can add in your suggestion as another testing point.</p></blockquote>
<p>The theory behind low-carb dieting has never made any correct predictions, as far as I know. It does not explain why the lost weight is often regained. If it turns out Jimmy Moore&#8217;s weight loss is due to his ketone adjustment, that will be the first correct prediction of the theory.</p>
<p>In contrast, the theory behind SLD led me to five new ways to lose weight (eating bland food, eating slowly-digested food, drinking unflavored sugar water, drinking oil with no smell, eating food nose-clipped). That&#8217;s roughly the same as  five correct predictions, two of them (drinking sugar water, drinking oil with no smell) counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>Jimmy Moore&#8217;s weight loss may eventually show you can lose weight via SLD even when you don&#8217;t realize you&#8217;re doing SLD.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In July, a Cambridge UK programmer named <a href="http://www.aspden.com/" target="_blank">John Aspden</a> <a href="http://johnlawrenceaspden.blogspot.com/2012/07/shangri-la-diet.html" target="_blank">wanted to lose weight</a>. He had already lost weight via a low-carb (no potatoes, rice, bread, pasta, fruit juice) diet. That was no longer an option. He came across the Shangri-La Diet. It seemed crazy but people he respected took it seriously so he tried it.  <a href="http://johnlawrenceaspden.blogspot.com/2012/11/shangri-la-diet-month-four-success-im.html">It worked</a>. His waist shrank by four belt notches in four months. With no deprivation at all.<span id="more-8184"></span></p>
<p>Before he started, he estimated the odds (i.e., his belief) of three different outcomes predicted by three different theories. What  would happen if he drank 300 calories (2 tablespoons) per day of unflavored olive oil (Sainsbury&#8217;s Mild Olive Oil)? Aspden considered the predictions of three theories.</p>
<blockquote><p>I called my three ideas of what would happen [= three theories that make different predictions] if I started eating extra oil Willpower, Helplessness and Shangri-La. (1) Willpower (W) is the conventional wisdom. If you eat an extra 300 calories a day you should get fatter. This was the almost unanimous prediction of my friends. Your appetite shouldn&#8217;t be affected. (2) Helplessness (H) was my own best guess. If you eat more, it will reduce your appetite and so you&#8217;ll eat less at other times to compensate, and so your weight won&#8217;t move. Whether this appetite loss would be consciously noticeable I couldn&#8217;t guess. This was my own best guess. (3) Shangri-La (S) is your theory. The oil will drop the set point for some reason, and as a result, you should see a very noticeable loss of appetite.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://johnlawrenceaspden.blogspot.com/2012/07/shangri-la-diet-experiment.html" target="_blank">More about these theories</a>. His original estimate of the likelihood of each prediction being true: W 39%, H 60%, S 1%. He added later, &#8220;I think I was being generous with the 1%&#8221;. After the prediction of the S theory turned out to be true, the S theory became 50 times more plausible, Aspden decided.</p>
<p>I like this a lot. Partly because of the quantification. If you were a high jumper in a world without exact measurement, people could only say stuff like &#8220;you jumped very high.&#8221; It would be more satisfying to have a more precise metric of accomplishment. It is a scientist&#8217;s dream of making an unlikely prediction that turns out to be true. The more unlikely, the more progress you have made. Here is quantification of what I accomplished. Although Aspden could find dozens of online reports that following the diet caused weight loss, he <strong>still</strong> believed that outcome very unlikely. Given that (a) the obesity epidemic has lasted 30-odd years and (b) people hate being fat, you might think that conventional wisdom about weight control should be assigned a very low probability of being correct.</p>
<p>I also like this because it is the essence of science: choosing between theories (including no theory) based on predictions. The more unlikely the outcome, the more you learn. You&#8217;d never know this from 99.99% of scientific papers, which say nothing about how unlikely the actual outcome was <em>a priori</em> &#8212; at least, nothing numerical. I can&#8217;t say why this happens (why an incomplete inferential logic, centered on<em> p</em> values, remains standard), but it has the effect of making good work less distinguishable from poor work. Maybe within the next ten years, a wise journal editor will begin to require both sorts of logic (Bayesian and <em>p</em> value). You need both. In Aspden&#8217;s case, the <em>p </em>value &#8212; which would indicate the clarity of the belt-tightening &#8212; was surely very large. This helped Aspden focus on the Bayesian aspect &#8212; the change in belief. This example shows how much you lose by ignoring the Bayesian aspect, as practically all papers do. In this case, you lose a lot. Anyone paying attention understands that the conventional wisdom about weight control must be wrong. Here is guidance towards a better theory. If not mine, you at least want a theory that predicts this result.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My personal science introduced me to a research method I have never seen used in research articles or described in discussions of scientific method. It might be called <strong>wait and see</strong>. You measure something repeatedly, day after day, with the hope that at some point it will change dramatically and you will be able to determine why. In other words: 1. Measure something repeatedly, day after day. 2. When you notice an outlier, test possible explanations. In most science, random (= unplanned) variation is bad. In an experiment, for example, it makes the effects of the treatment harder to see. Here it is good.</p>
<p>Here are examples where wait and see paid off for me:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Acne and benzoyl peroxide</strong>. When I was a graduate student, I started counting the number of pimples on my face every morning. One day the count improved. It was two days after I started using benzoyl peroxide more regularly. Until then, I did not think benzoyl peroxide worked well &#8212; I started using it more regularly because I had run out of tetracycline (which turned out not to work).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Sleep and breakfast</strong>. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/">I changed my breakfast from oatmeal to fruit</a> because a student told me he had lost weight eating foods with high water content (such as fruit). I did not lose weight but my sleep suddenly got worse. I started waking up early every morning instead of half the time. From this I figured out that any breakfast, if eaten early, disturbed my sleep.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Sleep and standing</strong> (twice). <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866/">I started to stand a lot to see if it would cause weight loss</a>. It didn&#8217;t, but I started to sleep better. Later, I discovered by accident that <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/03/effect-of-one-legged-standing-on-sleep/">standing on one leg to exhaustion made me sleep better</a>.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Brain function and butter</strong>. For years I measured how fast I did arithmetic. <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/08/13/arithmetic-and-butter/">One day I was a lot faster than usual. It turned out to be due to butter</a>.</p>
<p>5.<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/06/26/damage-due-to-mercury-revealed-by-brain-test/"><strong> Brain function and dental amalgam</strong></a>. My brain function, measured by an arithmetic test, improved over several months. I eventually decided that removal of two mercury-containing fillings was the likely cause.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Blood sugar and walking</strong>. My fasting blood sugar used to be higher than I would like &#8212; in the 90s. (Optimal is low 80s.) Even worse, it seemed to be increasing. (Above 100 is &#8220;pre-diabetic.&#8221;) <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2010/07/18/fasting-blood-sugar-reduced-by-walking/">One day I discovered it was much lower than expected</a> (in the 80s). The previous day I had walked for an hour, which was unusual. I determined it was indeed cause and effect. If I walked an hour per day, my fasting blood sugar was much better.</p>
<p>This method and examples emphasize the point that different scientific methods are good at different things and we need all of them (in contrast to evidence-based medicine advocates who say some types of evidence are &#8220;better&#8221; than other types &#8212; implying one-dimensional evaluation). One thing we want to do is <strong>test cause-effect ideas</strong> (X causes Y). This method doesn&#8217;t do that at all. Experiments do that well, surveys are better than nothing. Another thing we want to do is <strong>assess the generality of our cause-effect ideas</strong>. This method doesn&#8217;t do that at all. Surveys do that well (it is much easier to survey a wide range of people than do an experiment with a wide range of people), multi-person experiments are better than nothing. A third thing we want to do is <strong>come up with cause-effect ideas worth testing</strong>. Most experiments are a poor way to do this, surveys are better than nothing. This method is especially good for that.</p>
<p>The possibility of such discoveries is a good reason to self-track. Professional scientists almost never use this method. But you can.</p>
